PALL WINTER
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1975
the Gods have once again smiled upon the VPI Grotto this past year. So won-
drous have our adventures been that we can do naught but attempt to gloss over
the ordinary excitement and thrill of grotto living and highlight the extrava-
vances and extemporaneous activities of our more illustrious personnel. It is
for precisely such a reason that we bring you (a fanfare of trumpets, please):

Perhaps the most impressively active of the
Gods this past quarter has been Eros. I am sure
you are all familiar with the God of Love. Well,
so are the members of VPI. Since the last time the
Trog reared its literary head, four couples have
engaged in matrimonial bliss and at least one ad-
ditional couple has made plans for the same. This
romantically inclined group consists of the follow-
ing peoplet Bruce Byrd and Polly Wick: Jim Altman
and Lynn Richardson; Bob Page and Ellen (the girl
you all saw him with at UTR--We don't think anyone
knows her former last name); and Bill Park and
Carol Noble. Also on the potentially hooked list
are Randy Wood and Kathy Cronau who have become
engaged recently. Others, not yet engaged, but
decidedly involved in the grasp of Eros are Jim
"Jock" Bearden and Carol "Hobbit" Godla, who are
having plenty of fun fooling around with the an-
cient art of Fooney-Ha-Ha ; and Cheryl Jones and
Don Davison, who are more of a brouhaha (?) type
of couple.

In the world of expanding our education, we
have thrown wide our doors to the thrill of active
travel and the extension of E.L.M.T.s throughout
the known world, Over Christmas break, Jim Tabor
Denton, Mike Wolf and Keith Ortiz flew across the
continental United States and toured through Mex-
ico. Keith was dropped off rather soon after the
trio arrived in wiexico and the duo rambled onward
to climb mountains, drink, sightsee, drink, take
pictures, drink, etc. It seems that the highlight
of the trip was getting drunk with an American cam-
rade on Christmas Eve. Other trins of note include
the annual Thanksgiving-Alabama caving trip. This
year it was accomplished by Tom Calhoun, Bob Mead,
and Bob Alderson. While in Alabama they met up
with Skip Whitehurst and ran around busting their
tails and having a good-ole time. Also of possible
interest are those frequent trips in which Cheryl
and Don "just happen" to be on--Ellison's, Mammoth,
etc.
(Chip Clark) mopped up with his fantastic black
and white shots, Bob Alderson and Doug Perkins
won second place for song with original lyrics
and Don Davison won second place for both best
performer and for original lyrics, original tune
in the NSS Cave Ballad Contest. In terms of the
physical prowess of cavers, we also contributed.
In the tug-of-war contests the VAR females drugged
the Texas females all over. The VAR gentlemen
did the same to their honorable opponents. Cheryl
Jones took first place in the 100 ft. rope climb
with mechanicals in her class. Don Davison also
won first in his class for 100 ft climb and man-
aged a highly respectable second place for the
400 footer. All in all, it would appear that
it was a rather decent showing
iNow we have arrived at the portion of this
article that you have all been craving for. No,
I do not mean the end. Rather, I mean the general
who's who and what's what and why of our Grotto.
First off, we have them folks what are returning
to the fold after straying from the way. Bruce
and Polly Byrd are returning from their fling in
the great state of Texas and shall be near enough
to party with; they will be in Charleston, W.Va.
Doug Perkins has given up the fight in the east
trying to hold off the wild barbarians in Richmond
and shall stake his claim in the fertile Roanoke-
Salem area. It shall be very heartening to hear
his heils ring loud and clear over these mountain-
tops once more. And don't forget the stirring
magnificence of Amazing Grace screamed forth by
those near-Aryan lips. Those of you who remem-
ber Bill Stringfellow will be pleased (or perhaps
saddened) to hear that he has graced us with his
presence, for the most part. His story is as fol-
lows: After graduating from VPI with a B.A. in
Computer Science, with a job at Singer Simulation
in Maryland, he quit. He didn't like the work so
he went off to work for a dinner-theater. After
having his body there for a time, he quit. The
help was stupid and he couldn't stand wearing the
(ugh) clean clothes every day. So one day he was
down here, in a shiny new yellow van, out of work.
He now has a job working construction at $3.00 an
hour. Oh well. Also returning to us are Danny
and Lynn Wright, who have moved into the Roanoke
area and show their faces regularly. On a more
mundane subject, we have those people who have yet
to learn the power of the troglodytic grasp and
are still trying to leave. First and foremost are
Mike and Twila Frieders, long an established rock
at any meeting, now to be present no longer. It
seems that Mike has a better job offer up in the
Washington area and he is leaping at this chance
to advance his status. Steve Hall is also relin-
quishing his position here. He is graduating this
quarter with a M.S. in Geology. That's one way to
take care of your rocks. The illustrious editor
of the Trog, Cheryl Jones is going to graduate af-
ter 4 and two-thirds years with a degree (B.S.) in
forestry.
Our Own God, the great and omnipotent God of
Caving, the one, the only: CHERNOBOG! Excuse me,
I got carried away by the glory and grandeur that
is the power of Chernobog. It shan't happen again.
Anyway, The god, Chernobog, has granted us another
harvest of susceptible (oops) talented new members
to enrich our crop. So at this time you should all
be introduced to our new brood: Bob Mead-Donaldson
VPI #182, Jeannie Griffin VPI 183, wargie Lewter
VPI #184, and Donnie Carter VPI #185. The Trog
staff sends out its congratulations and condolen-
ces to any whom deserve it.
Convention last summer proved to be another
occassion to remember with VPI grotto again tak-
ing its share of glory. In artistic capability
we proved our merit with Janet Queissar getting
an award for one of her paintings and Phantom
