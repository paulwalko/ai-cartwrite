FALL/WINTER
THE TECH TROGLODYTE

what we were pulling was indeed
solid slabs of rock cemented to-
gether by clay and calcite veins.
We had enlarged the opening to a-
bout eight inches in diameter
One large stone, slightly loose,
but stubborn, kept us from our
goal. Finally, after five hours
it gave way and we slowly slid it
away revealing a hole just large
enough for Jan to barely squeeze
through. The passage sloped down
at a very steep angle and we had
a hand line tied in case anything
really rude was encountered. As
Jan wedged herself in, exhaled,
and slipped slowly forward, we
waited impatiently. Now only the
heels of her boots could be seen
and suddenly they were gone too.
"What the hell's going on
down there" I shouted. Back came
the reply "It opens up!" I turned,
grinning, to Bob, but he was gone
with a cloud of dust funneling down
into the slit. This left Rabbit
and myself pouting outside as we
were yet too large to fit.
The first obstacle encountered
was a short drop of about fifteen
feet for which Bob said he would
construct a rope ladder out of the
hand line. After explaining his
intent he, once again, disappeared
into the darkness and that was the
last we heard of him or Jan until
their return. Rabbit once again
tried to fit through but I, again,
ended up pulling him out by his
heels. Again we sat with that same
empty restless feeling as if wait-
ing for the return of an exam.
Finally, after an hour stretched
into hundreds, we heard a rustle,
some groans and scrapes, Jan
slowly emerged followed by Bob.
Both had grins running twice around
their heads. Bob reached out his
hand. Nothing needed to be said.
Mattachock Cave had seen it's first
light in almost half a billion years,

free fall for about seventy Ieet
to another ledge. Across the drop,
about fifty feet away, lay two
other passages, both of which looked
as to hold still more secrets. We
attempted to pendulum to these but
our rope could never reach so far.
The second ledge, as we were later
to find, connects through steep
fissure passage to the otherwise
blind Patriots Pit. This is the
first of the three drops just after
the ladder climb. It is a sixty
to seventy foot free fall dome pit
which has the habit of sucking in
caving gear which you, unknowing-
ly let your eyes off in the entrance
shoot. It would also accept your
body quite willingly if you should
give it a chance.
since this trip. Once recovering
our vision we found ourselves stand-
ing in a large room about 150 feet
long and twenty feet wide. Shear
walls towered above and breakdown
covered the floor. This marked an
end to our exploration for any
continuing passage appeared to be
be totally blocked by collapse.
As we peered up a dome pit at one
end of the room a large black hole
looned sixty feet above. The walls
were like glass and even Alderson
couldn't fly.
Bob, Jan and myself returned
to the cave along with Rick Whitt
the following week end. After dig-
ging a bit more we could all make
the tight saueeze through. The
passage was very steep and opened
immediately into a small room a-
bout three feet high which was
handy for storing gear before
the rest of the party arrived.
The ladder climb lay just beyond.
After descending the climb we fol-
lowed the passage down and around
a bend. It suddenly opened into
a room no less than seventy five
feet in diameter with a thirty
foot ceiling. I couldn't believe
my eyes. This, it was decided
should be dubbed the Fourth of
July Room for this what Bob had
first set eyes on during that
day Mattachock was opened. We
entered the room on a false floor
composed of large breakdown plugs.
It was sinilar to the Mud Bridge
in Pig Hole. Off to the sides
lay several passage leads as well
as three pits. The largest and
deepest of these we called
Prophesy and it was to this that
we first rigged our rope. It was
my pleasure to be the first to
descend. As I leaned back and
cast away I overlooked a total
drop of about a hundred feet. A
large balconey lay about fifteen
feet below and, from this, came
The base of Frophesy Fit is
a mud-gravel depression about fif-
teen feet in diameter. At the
lower end a muddy jagged passage
leads off, again downward. We
traveled only Iorty Ieet before
being confronted by another obst -
cle. We found ourselves at the
base of a small dome pit with no
readily apparent way to go, but
straight up. High passage was
within sight and, as usual, it took
Bob Alderson to finally find the
way up. It was a narrow fissure
to one side of the pit. Capping
the top was a gut gouging pinch
which really should have been named.
The hole, however, has been enlarged
We returned to the top of
Frophesy, checked out a few other
leads and then had the misfortune
to descend the last of the three
pits. Proctoscopic pit, if you
really want to call it a pit, is
a three stage drop of forty, thirty
and twenty feet. The first forty
is fine. Bob descended first.
He was gone for a half hour then
called for Rick. He left and Jan
and myself waited another half hour
before hearing a faint call to
continue. As I edged over the drop
which constituted the second stage
things began to look a little grim.
I was no longer rappelling down the
wall, but rather, inside what ap-
peared to be a wall. My boots
merged, then my legs. I couldn't
find my breakbars or the rope I
was attached to. I looked down
just to see that the worst was yet
to come. The third stage, The
