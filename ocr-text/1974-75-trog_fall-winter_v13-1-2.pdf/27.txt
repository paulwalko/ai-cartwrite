A Fantasy on a late Fall Cave Club meeting in
the Smyth Hall Auditorium: A meeting notable only
for the number of flies in the room, sick dogs and
snoring cavers. The president was at the front of
the room suppressing drunken cat calls and swatting
flies away from the mouth of his beer bottle.
The scene was set for the entrance of two mem-
bers who came through the back doors, distracting
everybody's attention from the dog that had just
claimed territorial rights to the base of the po-
dium,
The pair eased themselves into seats in the
back. One was tall and gaunt, with a palid com-
plexion and eyes that protruded from his head like
the eyes of a frog. The other was short and hunch-
ed over. His hair was black and his arms suggested
that he was more accustomed to climbing walls than
he was to walking.
Still, nobody paid much attention when Frog
Eyes stood up and announced, "There is a cave right
there". He indicated the spot on a topographical
map he held by covering an area of three square
miles with his bony hand.
"We're going to find it this weekend," he
croaked, "Igor and I," Nobody thought about Frog
Eyes and Igor and uncaringly went to the mountain
after the meeting. The party there went on for
hours into the night; into the rain and for that
came up the mountainside, Cavers in various states
of awareness were grouped about the fire, moving
to and fro, dodging the smoke and the smudge cre-
ated by a streaker who failed to clear a jump over
the fire. Three or four cavers were wandering
through the crowd, unsuccessfully trying to catch
up with a young lady. She was finally caught when
she stumbled over a caver wearing a stoven guitar
over his head.
"Hey," he shouted, "This is a dead end pit;
nothing's here."
"Okay," came the reply, "We'll send you some
knots." A pause while Igor attached the prussiks
to the rope. "Equipment!"
The three sat and waited while the banjo play-
er rigged in and began climbing out. About half
way up, he exclaimed, "Damn it! My seat safety is
slipping."
"Try to retie it," Frog Eyes replied,
"But I'll flip over," the banjo player cried.
"But you'll never get out if you don't," Frog
Eyes remarked. They waited five more minutes until
they heard a scream from below.
"God Damn it, help me!" came the wail. "I'm
hanging from my ankle!"
Frog Eyes glanced over the edge of the drop
and moved up the passage. They kept going until
the complaints of the banjo player were absorbed
by the enclosing rocks.
The young lady was a bit dazed by the circum-
stances surrounding the loss of their other member,
but she didn't complain when Igor asked her to
push the tight and muddy crawlway that headed down
off of the main passage. She slid in head first,
stopping at the tight spot, wedging herself in,
her arms pinned to her side. A weak flutter kick
with her feet served only to wedge her in tighter.
frog Eyes and Igor listened to the muffled
cries coming from the crawl for a minute or so,
then headed on up the passage. Eventually they
reached a point that was wide enough for them to
walk side by side, and long enough to suck up all
the llight that their lamps put out. They walked
on, leaving foot prints behind them in the soft
mud,
Igor finally spotted a large grotto off to
the side. They entered.
"Yes, Igor," Frog Eyes said, "This should do."
Igor was seated and unlacing his boots while Frog
Byes studied the ceiling, appreciating every crack
and joint. Igor had begun climbing the wall as
Frog Eyes removed his boots.
"This will do very well, indeed," He started
climbing up to where Igor was already hanging up-
side down, his toes jammed into the joint system.
"Yes, Igor. Yes, indeed, this will do very
ed the and unloves sai
well."
Frog Eyes and Igor had been observing the en-
tire party and remained detached from the crowd.
At about four in the morning they lured the banjo
player and the young lady out of the crowd.
"Hey, you wanna get high?" Igor called out.
The banjo player followed him away from the group.
Frog Eyes approached the young lady: "We're driv-
ing off the mountain if you need a ride away from
these bohemians."
The four piled into a clapped-out Volkswagen
bug and rode off the mountain. However, they did
not head towards campus; Igor drove them to the
northwestern side of Big Walker Mountain in Bland
County. They pulled up in a field next to a pond
and parked.
"Wait a minute; what're we doing here?" The
banjo player and the young lady began complaining
simultaneously.
Frog Eyes turned to the banjo player; "Well,"
he said, "We're going caving now, we'll get you
high afterwards."
And to the young lady: "You have been trying
to get someone to take you caving all fall--now's
your chance, Igor, distribute the gear."
When everyone had gear, they followed Frog
Eyes up the side of the mountain. Igor stayed
behind long enough to push the bug into the pond
and watched it sink into its own whirlpool of
bubbles.
Just past the tree line on the side of a shal-
low gully, they found a small holes just large en-
ough to put a fist through, drawing air in from the
forest. After two hours work with a crow bar, they
were able to squeeze through
Inside, they saw sights no one had ever seen
before. The cave followed the dip of the rock down
into the mountain, Around the first bend, the cave
opened up beautifully, becoming a large room with
a vaulted ceiling and break-down floor cmplete
with black rocks that led downward into che void,
igor rigged the first drop. The banjo player
rigged in and descended.
