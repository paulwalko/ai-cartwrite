You remember the old poem written on the bath-
room that started something like this: "Here I sit
broken hearted..."? A new ending that applies as I
sit here is: "Came to write but couldn't get
started." So I'll just grunt and give it a try
anyway.
cerned, are the calls that come from area resi-
dents, college students, and from people outside
this area. All these calls concern caving. The
type of information these people are seeking can
be broken down into two categories: those people
who just want cave Locations so that they can go
caving with their own little group.
The first category of people are fine, for
that is the purpose of this club - to bring togeth-
er people that have the common interest of speleol-
ogy. Those people are welcome to cave with this
club at any time.
During the last few days I've had several
topics on my mind for this column. The first few
were immediately tossed out as I was still under
the influence of what many people have termed a
great weekend -- the tenth annual VPI Cave Club
banquet and happening. Perhaps now is a good time
to extend thanks for the success to mike Wolf (no e)
for banquet itself and the awards, and to Sam
Osborne for the party. And a special thanks to
Bill Stringfellow, who is perhaps the only VPI
caver that can handle 100 liquor bottles and
stay sober
After wiping my thoughts, the one subject
that stinks in my head is the fact that my phone
keeps ringing. Diany of these calls I don't mind
invites to parties, a little club business, a few
calls about school business, a rescue now and then
and a few personal calls. The calls that do bother
me, not so much by being annoyed as by being con-
The second category of people are the point of
my concern. They are in a much greater number than
many of you realize. There are 17,000 students on
this campus and if just one tenth of them have, still
do, or will cave, would mean an increase of 1700
cavers to this area. Since we just have twenty three
regular members in our club, we are a minority cav-
ing group in this area. And that 1700 figure does
not even include the local area people or people that
come from other areas!!
Since we are the only known and publicized cav-
ing group in this area, we get blamed for everything
that goes wrong and credited with very little that
goes right. Since becoming President of this club,
whenever I have overheard strangers and even friends
talk about caving, I try to make it a point to enter
their conversation, not to try and get them to become
club members, but rather to try and get them to be
thoughtful to landowners and be concious of certain
safety precautions. I do mention that there is an
organized caving group on campus and say when and
where we meet,
On the calls I receive, I do bring up landowners,
safety, and the club but I do not give the inform-
ation they are seeking - cave locations. The only
location I have ever given out is. New River Cave be-
cause I think many of you agree if we are going to
have non cave club caving activities in this area
we had just as soon let them happen in New River.
I think it's up to each one of you to make up
your own mind as to how and what you should say to
these people, But remember, their action will be
reflected on this club.
