On Thanksgiving, a day when
most people are sitting down to a
gluttonous feast, a small but de-
termined band of cavers were strug-
gling up a hillside somewhere in
Alabama towards Green's Well.
the deepest free fall pit in the
continental United States, Surprise
was first decended by Bill Cudding-
ton, in the early 60's. We rigged
up on the break-down bridge as best
we could, since another group had
rigged the bolts on the wall.
It all started Tuesday after-
noon; Tom Calhoun, Bob Alderson and
I had departed Blacksburg at about
3 p.m., arriving in a wooded, but
not secluded spot on the road to-
ward Pigeon Mountain, We warmed
up the first of many gourmet meals
to come. Wednesday was the day
for Mystery Hole, or falls, which-
ever it really is: I never can re-
member. Situated near Ruby Falls
Tourist Trap on Lookout Mt, it is
an impressive pit, known for its
famous dam. Having closed the
round metal stopper on the 12 inch
drain pipe in the base of the dam,
one has varying amounts of time,
according to the rate of flow of
the stream, in which one rappels
the 270-odd foot pit. Of course,
the fun begins when one ascends
the rope. During the Spring, there
would tend to be more water and the
reservoir may fill to capacity in
a matter of minutes. This piques
one's competitive spirit, to get
up the rope before the water can
Friday was the day for Valhalla
a brisk two mile hike up a jeep
trail, and then a mind boggling
chasm. Dusk was upon us before
the last man was down the 220 foot
drop. Ravaged by hunger, we ascen-
ded the rope and trudged down the
hill toward our well-provisioned
vehicle. Back at the home, we re-
laxed over a can of beer and thought
about the big one tomorrow Fern.
Then the rain came. It began in
the night, by morning pools were
forming in the center of the floor.
although I doubt it would ever lead
to calcite formations. Reaching
from the sleeping bag, my knife
punched a few strategic holes in
the floor to stave off inundation.
Through rain and worse we went
up the mountain towards Fern's en
trance waterfalls, discomfited more
by the presence of hunters than by
the inclement weather. Once in the
cave, one follows a stream at vary-
ing levels depending upon the skill
of the individual caver, and his at-
titude toward wet feet. Suddenly,
the floor gives way and one finds
himself on a downward sloping ledge
four hundred and twenty feet above
the bottom of Surprise Pit. Until
the recent discoveries in Ellison's,
Fifty feet below the breakdown,
the walls fall out of sight. No-
thing is visible except the rope
dissappearing out of sight. Occas-
ionally a slick spot in the rope
speeds the rappeller up, but con-
trol is never lost. Skip Whitehurst,
the consummate Alabama Pit Caver,
was in his element. All four of
us were down and having seen the
sights, started back up, two at a
time. At the top we hauled up the
rope, took one last look at the pit,
and the clay figures on the wall
near the bolts and started out.
(the hell with dry feet), trudging
through the stream. The rain was
steadier and followed us back to
the car, turning to snow that night.
Sunday was driving day, and the
closer to Blacksburg, the worse
the conditions and the slower we
moved, but all destinations are
eventually reached. Next Spring
it's Anvil Cave.
overflow the dam and drench the
climber. The aspect of being pound-
ed by the plunging stream must be
a great incentive to those who take
delight in tempting the Fates. As-
ide from such considerations, the
highlight of the trip is watching
the dam being flushed while below.
At first nothing is heard, then a
whooshing sound and a gigantic
white column descends, crashing
into the floor, creating wind, mist
and deafening noise.
So much for Mystery Falls and
on to the Guess Creek House, or the
Whitehurst Arms, as it is sometimes
called, situated close to Guess
Creek Cave, Alabama's only horizon-
tal cave in the deep pit region
East of Huntsville. The house has
all the conveniences; open air, run-
ning water (whenever it rains), and
sunken floors (ask Bob Alderson).
Anyway, the place provides cavers
and winos a home away from home.
Back to Green's Well--an impressive
2740 or less, judging from the spa-
ghetti on the floor. The bottom is
wet, but the caver wishing to keep
his feet dry can trip lightly over
large stones cluttering the shallow
pool, or pendulum into the water-
fall. Back to Guess Creek, fine
cuisine, and the camaraderie, etc.
of a Thanksgiving on the road.
