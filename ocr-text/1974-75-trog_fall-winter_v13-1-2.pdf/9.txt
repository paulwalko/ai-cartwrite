Hopefully, this preliminary report will
be followed up in the future by articles by
some energetic cavers who will continue to
explore the Wolf Creek Valley ares. It could
easily prove to be another Sandusky Hollow.
Cavers have passed through the area be-
fore, usually on their way to Tazewell Coun-
ty, but the valley was ignored; particularly
after one caver said he had checked the area
and had found nothing. So only two caves
exist on record, Straley's Cave and Giant
Caverns. (Neither are very extensive, al-
though impressive.) This number, however,
will undoubtedly change.
My interest in the area originated while
taking a structural geology course. One
field trip required a structure section that
passed through Wolf Creek Valley. This re-
vealed that the Middle Ordivician limestones
and dolomites, the rocks in which most of
the caves of our area occur, crop out on
the southern slope of Wolf Creek, that is,
Wolf Creek Mountain. Because the structure
in the area is a syncline, these same rocks
appear on the other side of Wolf Creek Moun-
tain, on Pearis Mountain, in Wilburn Valley.

Before leaving, we split into five groups;
four of which went to Wolf Creek Valley, the
other to the back end of Wilburn Valley.
The day turned out to be magnificant,
both in weather and in success. All five
groups managed to find something. The Wil-
burn Valley group turned up new leads on
locals' information, one which they checked,
A hole in pasture too small to get into took
3 seconds for rocks pitched in to finally hit
bottom. A later trip opened up Dixon Caverns
and a series of drops totalling about 165 fee to
The Wolf Creek Valley groups got several
leads from locals, many of which still have
to be checked out. Some of the Leads were
checked, some new virgin caves were found.
All in all, project was a success, even just
from the fact that Wolf Creek has shown a
great potential.
In conclusion, I wish to reflect some
of my insights about the area. I was amazed
as to how high the limestone cropped out on
the mountain, at an elevation of about 2700
feet. With this in mind, I am hoping for
some some really deep pits in the area. Also
the areas that I divided up were much too
large for the groups to cover in one day, so
that part of the valley is by no means through-
ly checked out, particularly since very few
people made it to the upper contact of the
Middle Ordivician limestones. By no means is
this report detailed. More specific reports
will hopefully be submitted by cavers who
like to search for new adventures in Wolf
Creek Valley.

Shortly after its eaucamronar am
began caving in Wilburn Valley, grew inter-
ested, and did a bit of looking through the
club files. Numerous caves were reported
there, ranging from FRO's to Starne's
Also, Wilburn Valley Cave had just been
found, and it contained an impressive 105
foot pit. Remembering the geology of the
area, I checked Wolf Creek Mountain and was
astounded that only two small caves had been
reported.
Since our last project to Smyth County
uncovered little, Wolf Creek could not be
any worse. The club attempted to have pro-
ject there in the spring of 74, but when
the day arrived, the weather forecast called
for rain, and the skies threatened, so T
called it all off. Lo and behold, one hour
later, the skies cleared, totally destroying
any trust I had in modern weather prediction
Joe Saunders and Keith Ortiz began to
look in the valley, after catching wind of
the possibilities there. They reported some
finds which further strengthened my desire
for a project.
A good turnout of twenty-five hardy
members and trainees met in the parking lot
on November 9. As it turned out, twenty-
three made it to the mountain. Our presi-
dent and his wife had to leave for the vet
when their dog executed a nose dive off one
