FALL/WINTER
_THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1975
of Crumps a narrow canyon, One
could either slink by sideways at
the bottom in the stream or chin-
ney about on narrow ledges at the
top. Even worse, this was one of
the few muddy canyons in the cave,
The dripping and the frequent for-
mations indicated we were out from
under the sandstone caprock. After
17 stations, it looked like the
passage was flowstoned shut. But
no, a squeezeway led back into the
canyon! Drat! I was getting sleepy
and was perfectly willing to let
another group of Crumpers follow
this piece of crap to its end.
However, Keith had sworn that he'd
map until he fell asleep or mapped
80 stations, whichever came first.
I gave in, and after 21 more sta-
tions, the passage ended in mud
fill, the stream leaving through
an impassable crevice. Near the
end, the notebook fell out of my
chest pocket as I was chimneying,
and onto a ledge only a foot away
from the impassable crevice con-
taining the stream,
Before turning back at the
mud fill, we split a can of goosh,
the boiled sweetened condensed
milk. We were at the farthest
point from the entrance, over two
miles away, a mile of that crawling.
We then headed back down thes "mud
canyon", throwing two shots into a
side canyon to get our 80 stations
for the day, a new one day record
for Crumps, Our total footage was
about 1430 feet. Two hours later
'We were back at Base Camp, delayed
only by Keith's running ahead and
missing the turnoff, . A quick
snack, then into the sack for a-
nother "night's sleep.
Upon awakening, we spent con-
siderable time eating, dressing and
packing for the way out. In fact,
a considerable portion of the time
we were in the cave was spent in
eating, dressing, recarbiding,
short rests, packing, etc.; gen-
erally unproductive activities, to
be sure, but certainly more pleas-
ant than crawling or mapping, both
of which require moving about.
One tends to try to put off "get-
ting going" for as long as possi-
ble in Crumps, You always feel
like just sitting there and resting
After spraying our rental
sleeping bags ($1 a night) with
Lysol and rolling them up into
plastic bags with desiccant, we
bid adeiu to the Happy Crawl Base
Camp. We made good time on the
way out of the cave, continuing with
out kneepads for the sandy crawls,
and putting them back on for the
chert or bedrock crawls. Actually,
our knees and elbows were in good
condition considering the use they
were getting. And my body was not
nearly as sore as it had been on
earlier trips, thanks no doubt to
the rest we'd gotten in the sleep-
ing bags. We finally exited into
a driving rain at 3:30 AM, after
6C hours underground.
It is this type of caving
which has brought Crumps to 9.1
miles mapped, or number 2 in the
area, behind the Viammoth-Flint
Ridge System. Bost trips tc Crumps
Avenue involve some sleeping or
napping, if only before starting
out. And these are not expedi-
tions in the C-3 or SINCR fash-
ion, with coolies bringing in sup-
plies for explorers, except for
the sleeping bags themselves,
everything to be used must be
brought in by those 'to use it.
Between us, Keith and I brought
in a can each of goosh, crushed
pineapple, grapes, fruit cock-
tail, chili, a box of granola,
and three bags of hard candy.
This for 60 hours, Needless to
say, we were hungry when we got
out. The casualties of the trip
were one pack and my pair of
coveralls.
It is apparent that another
sleeping bag is needed at Base
Camp, because with drops being
encountered 8-10 hours from the
entrance, it would be nice to
have three man teams back there.

After descending the first pit I sat in the
darkness putting away my gear. As I glanced
down to uns trap a sling I noticed, to the
side, a mound of mud about four feet high
and leading nowhere but to an island in space.
Yet here were claw marks, as if desperately
trying to climb this hump as if it was a last
chance for escape. At the base of the mound
Ilay a skeleton, on its side and the same color
as the earth in which it lay. It was obvious
what had happened...
HE FOUND IT RATHER STRANGE HOW HE
ACCEPTED IT ON SUCH A MOMENTS NOTICE...
SURE, HE HAD FLASHING THOUGHTS OF WHAT
IT WAS ALL ABOUT, BUT AS HE LAY THERE
ALL BUSTED INSIDE, THE ANSWER LAY BEFORE
HIM... WITHIN REACH...
WONDER WHAT THE ROCKS THOUGHT... 450
MILLION YEARS SINCE THEY HAD SEEN THE
SUN AND HERE, HARDLY A FLASH... COME
AND NOW TO DECAY AND ONCE AGAIN BECOME
ONE WITH IT... ANOTHER NEW SPECIES...
BUT THAT MUST BE IT...
LOST IN A PLACE WHERE LIFE IS NOT REAL...

THE FALL THROUGH THE SLIT WAS SO FAST
THAT HE HAD NO TIME TO CONTEMPLATE...
SO FAST AND YET THE WATER SOOTHED. . .
THROUGH THE FOG OF HIS SHALLOW BREATHS
HE COULD FAINTLY SEE THE GLOW OF THE
ENTRANCE UPON THE WET GRAVEL... IT WOULD
SURVIVE HIM... AND SO, DEEP WITHIN A
DISCOVERY UNKNOWN, NEVER TO BE SEEN OR
HEARD AGAIN, HE SMILED CONTENTLY AND
JOINED TIME...
