Rope
With the tremendous number of cavers doing vertical pitches these
days. it is very important safety-wise to understand some things
about the ropes to which we all entrust our lives.
Nylon is a generic term for
a family of polyamides and is de-
fined as: "Any long chain poly-
meric amide which has recurring
amide groups as an intergral part
of the main polymer chain." Com-
mercial nylon polymers vary not
only in molecular structure, but
also by molecular weight within
each particular structure. Some
of the common nylons are types
6/6, 6/10, and 12. Within each
of these types are high and low
molecular weight grades. While
the physical properties of these
different nylon polymers vary
widely, their chemical properties
are very similar.
The name applied to nylon
polymers in Europe is "Perlon".
It is from the misunderstanding
of the meaning of this term that
people ofter refer to the dynamic
ropes manufactured in Europe as
perlon ropes. While they are made
from perlon polymer, they are of
kernmantle construction. Differ-
ent rope manufacturers use iden-
tical nylon filaments and produce
ropes with different elasticity
and strength. The selection of a
proper type rope depends upon its
intended use, but for most caving
activities ropes such as Blue
Water are best.
While the problem of abra-
sive particles penetrating the
sheath and cutting the inner
strands is not completely solved
by pre-treatment and frequent
laundering, it can be slowed suf-
ficiently to make kernmantle rope
usable for the life of the outer
sheath. Allowing nylon ropes to
become extremely dirty and using
them in that condition not only
destroys the rope, but causes se-
vere damage to expensive descend-
ing and ascending equipment. A
dirty rope is NOT a status symbol,
It generally denotes improper
care. While all ropes eventually
become dull colored and fuzzy from
use, there is no excuse for a 5/8"
diameter mud rod with a 7/16" ny-
lon core. Due to the fact that
internal damage cannot be in-
spected in braided ropes, it is
extremely important to protect
this type of rope from unneces-
sary exposure to dirt.
I have heard many types of
rope cleaning procedures recom-
mended and most had some merit.
I have seen ropes pulled up
rivers behind power boats, and
I once met a young couple wash-
ing their most prized possession,
a new 350 Blue Water, in a creek
with toothbrushes! It worked
well, but was a little slow. The
most practical way to wash a ny-
lon rope is in one of the big
round front-opening commercial
washers at a laundromat. They
have a large round sight glass in
the door. Make sure it is glass
instead of plastic as it is pos-
sible with a with a plastic win-
dow enough to generate sufficient
heat to fuse a portion of the out
er surface. It is best to put
the rope in the washer in a loose
bundle instead of a tight coil,
because it cleans more efficien-
tly. Another important point is
to make sure all the rope is in-
side the drum of the washer and
not hanging out around the edges.
Lengths up to 600 feet can be
easily washed in this manner.
Upon removal from the washer, the
rope will be tangled, but patience
and a little help from your
friends will usually prove super-
ior to the snarls. Washers with
central rotating agitators should
be avoided as the rope tends to
become very tightly entangled a-
bout the agitator.
The proper water temperature
and cleaning agent for nylon rope
always brings up great contro-
versy, especially among those who
know very little about cleaning
agents and nylon chemical struc-
ture. Nylon polymers can with-
stand 180Â°F immersion indefinite-
ly with no degradation of the
polymer. Immersion in liquids a-
bove 3000F for more than a few
minutes should be avoided. Water
boils considerably below this
temperature, so this means it is
best to wash your rope in HOT
water. At most commercial laun-
dries hot water is about 1400F,
which is sufficient to do an ex-
cellent cleaning job.
The next question is what
kind of cleaning agent to use.
Our research department (Marbon
Chemical Division of Borg-Warner)
decided not long ago that the
company should enter the soap
business, so we did extensive in-
vestigations on commercially a-
vailable cleaning agents. I am
not pushing any products, just
sharing some results of our re-
search work.
Some purists recommend nat-
ural soaps like Ivory. Their
fault is that the natural soaps
lack the necessary additives to
keep the removed dirt suspended
in the water so it settles back
on the surface of the article be-
ing cleaned. The result is that,
while they don't hurt anything,
they dont clean very well either.
All detergents when dissolved in
water are alkaline, and clean by
the action of either phosphates
or carbonates. Nylon is not af-
Pected by such alkaline conditions.
All soaps and detergents avail-
able at the grocery store for
Laundry use can be safely used on
nylon. The best liquid cleaning
agents for nylon are the deter-
gents such as Wisk, and Liquid All
and the best powder detergent
seems to be Tide. The use of
special pre-soaks such as Axion
and Biz before washing is of lit-
tle value. If you have a white
nylon rope and want to bleach it.
that is alright also. Do NOT uge
chlorine bleach, but try one of
the others available at a grocery
store for nylon. There has been
some questions raised about Borax.
Borax will NOT harm nylon. You
can even use a little Bo-Peep an
monia if it turns you on.
Since some ropes tend to be-
come very stiff after extended
use, everyone sooner or later
ponders whether to use fabric
softener on their rope. Soften-
After purchasing a new rope
and before its first field use,
it should be washed. This should
be done for two reasons to re-
move the oil and other lubricants
that inadvertently remain on the
rope filaments from manufacture,
and, more importantly, to "set"
the rope. This pre-use treat-
ment of the rope is very important
as it can increase the usable
life of the rope many times.
The first time a rope is
washed, it will shrink a consid-
erable amount. This shrinkage is
very important for several rea-
sonst (1) it stabilizes the elas-
ticity of the rope, (2) in laid
ropes (e.g. Goldline), it tightens
the strands, (3) on braid over
braid ropes (e.g. Sampson, West
707), it closes the openings in
the inner braid and tightens the
outer braid somewhat, and (4) on
ropes of kernmantle construction
(e.g. Blue Water, Dynamic olimb-
ing ropes), it tightens the sheath
over the inner core and closes
the openings in the braided sheath
enough to prevent almost all pen-
etration by mud and dirt to the
inner supporting filaments.
