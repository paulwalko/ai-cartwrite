FALL/WINTER
THE TECH TROGLODYTE_
1975

room which Don Anderson had dis-
covered.
it seemed to catch and I slowly
pulled my way over using a Jumar
for hauling. Just as t reached
the other side, however, the rocks
broke loose. It would have been
nice if there was passage on the
opposite side for I would have had
plenty of momentum to reach it.
Unfortunately there was only a mud
covered wall which I came to be a
close acquaintance of. Another try
did work, however, and I wedged my-
self into the passage.
Things looked just as grim.
The leads were extremely tight and
the dome pit lead remained in-
accessible without bolts. "Where
in hell is all this air going???"
If I found out anything at all
from this excuse for a cave, that
would be the question.
pinch but had returned shortly to
wait for me. Tom and Mat had been
gone for a half hour and we waited
another half hour before heering
from them again. I was
beginning to wonder if it was
possible they were into some-
thing. Finally, a call from Tom.
As it was, he said they were
waiting for us to come through.
He returned to invite us once more.
Being totally drenched, tired and
obviously not too enthusiastic
about this particular section, I
declined. He said Mat and himself
would then continue and return in
about twenty minutes. Ed and myself
sat back to, once again, wait.
I, half heartidly, crammed
my body in the left hand crawl.
It sloped down and came to a narrow
mud filled bend which I could not
see around. I pushed further,
pulling out a few blocks but, none
the less, getting myself gloriously
wedged. I called Mat to help pull
my legs and so, after thrashing
about, slowly withdrew, disgusted.
I wish I could say that it
opened into booming trunk channel
but this was not the case. Oh, it
goes all right but, again, it is
none the less than tight, sharp,
wet crawls, intersected by more
pits. I was in no shape or mood
to fully explore them all. re-
turning to the pendulum drop I
clipped in to my break bars, asked
Bob Alderson to belay me from a
ledge below and bailed out of that
God forsaken passage with the
samurai cry of "Falling!!!" Slam-
ming against the opposite wall
and leaving a cartoon impression
of myself in the mud, I totally
lost control and relied on Bob
to bring me to a safe landing.
He did...
As I left to explore the lead
in the other direction Tom eyed
the squeeze and threw himself in
After a bit of moaning and swearing
his feet disappeared.
"Could such miserable passage
ever give birth to anything?.. No
way... but where is that air going??"
I was baffled and disgusted with
the whole mess. At this point I
wasn't even anxious knowing Tom and
Mat had been gone so long. "Next
time I come to this mountain it will
be Summer and this time I'll bring
my tubes..." My thought was inter-
upted by a shuffle and groan. Ever
so slowly Tom and Mat emerged from
that same hole which had laughed
at me. A smile... that same encr-
mously contagious grin which had
donned Bob and Jan on July fourth
was plastered all over their faces.
"It goes... Booming passage... Large
stream...
We were all ready to leave so,
as a last minute thought, Bob dropped
his handkerchief on down the drop
thinking that perhaps it connected
in below Frophesy Pit. We would
have to search for it in a later
trip. That later trip would not
come until January of 1975.
The tight, wet, muddy fissures
which constituted the right hand
lead offered only grief. They
split off in unending branches
but seemed too tight to continue.
After crashing through a rotten
false ledge and pinning my neck
in a mud-rock slot I decided I
had seen enough and returned to
the dome pit. When I surfaced
I found Ed sitting alone by the
left hand lead. He said he had
followed Tom and Mat through the
Mattachock has become a maior
cave. I guess I'll have to return.
We had completed an overland
survey between Mattachock and Sal-
amander in September but the cave
itself was not entered. As it
turned out, the only useful data
we gained from this excursion was
the knowledge that Big Walker, at
times, becomes infested with Timber
Rattlers. As Bob Alderson looked
through the transit bull's eye
just to see the smiling face of one
of our reptilian friends, it is
understandable that his mind may
have wandered a bit. After seeing
three within an hour we were all
rather cautious.

. Finally, on January 19th
Tom Calhoun, Mat Scott, Ed Devine
and myself returned. We hoped
to explore a bit more across the
Prophesy Traverse and also try
and find Bobs Handkerchief.
Having only a limited amount of
time, however, we forfeiteatne

peled directly to the lower sections.

time hunting the apparent ghost
handkerchief and then continued
"AS I leaned back and cast away, I over-
looked a total drop of about 100'..."
