Garbage
Bags:
For Comfort
and
Survival
* Don Davison
Have you ever been forced into inactivity
within a cave, and felt helpless as you chill
(e.g. at the bottom or top of a deep or wet drop,
while belaying a technical aid climb, or in a
rescue situation)? Have you been in this condi-
tion because the change of clothes or extra chest
clothing was left behind as too bulky and incon-
venient? Or was it because you had worn too many
layers of garments, and noticed too late they had
become damp with the perspiration of active cav-
ing and lost much of their insulating power? An
inexpensive, compact, disposable, multi-use solu-
tion to the problem may be found in the plastic
garbage bag.
Each "Glad" brand plastic garbage bagl weighs
only 2 ounces, costs about 12Â¢, and may be carried
flat, or rolled into a cylinder, 4" long and 1.25"
in diameter, with a volume of only 5 cubic inches
(22% of the volume occupied by an 8 ounce baby
bottle). The bag is strong, and, although some
care is desirable if moving through tight places,
the tears from snagging usually result in relativ-
ely minor holes.
Many a caver has waited for those before him
to finish ascending a deep pit, while the inactiv-
ity, waterfall spray, and breese contributed to
his overall chilling. Several of these factors
may be reduced through the use of the garbage bag
in one several configurations. The caver could:
1. Cut a tight neck hole and wear the bag over
his upper torso, with no arm holes; 2. Place the
bag over his head and upper body in a tent like
fashion (with a small hole in the top of the bag
to allow slow air circulation through chimneying);
3. If some activity is required, cut arm and neck
holes and wear the bag like a sweater or shirt.
Holes should be made carefully and as small as
possible. If situations are anticipated, the
modifications may be made before entering the
cave, and the edges of the holes reinforced with
ducting tape. Using these arrangements, mist
and spray is kept off the caver's clothing, the
chill factor associated with a breeze is all but
eliminated from the covered areas, and an insu-
lating layer of, , in essense, non-moving air is
formed, reducing heat lost through convection
and evaporation.
A carbide caver, when producing his own
tent, as in method, 2, might: 2a. Place a second
garbage bag on a rock; and sitting on it, face
his carbide lamp towards himself and place it on
the ground between his thighs. Thus he has pro-
duced a space heater for his tent. The amount of
heat may be controlled by adjusting the flame and
the size of the chimney hole. The chimneying of
the hot air up the front of the caver's body.
will dry clothing on the chest, thighs, and arms
with the heat of evaporation supplied by the car-
bide lamp, not the caver's body. By opening the
shirt and trousers front, the drying of under-
garments may be enhanced and some of their in-
sulating power regained.
Garbage bags may also be used in a more pre-
ventative mode. Several more cavers might be al-
ive today, if they had worn garbage bags while
in wet drops--instead, they are hypothermia sta-
tistics, When moving through or near waterfalls,
er these armes reinting the
or in the area of heavy drip: 4. The bag is
placed over the head and upper torso, and then
the helmet is positioned on top. The chin strap
is positioned and a breathing hole is immediat-
ely pinched open. A mouth hole and two eye
holes may be formed, or a single full face open-
ing. Arm holes are then added. In this manner,
the neck and back are protected from water run-
ning off the rear of the helmet and from heavy
spray or splatter, which would chill the sen-
sitive rear neck area and run into the chest
garments. This arrangement has worked very
satisfactorily, with "Glad" brand garbage bags
in Ellison's Cave, Ga., while entering through
waterfalls, and descending in and near them,
when the cave was in full flood.
Although the aspects of comfort are delt
with almost exclusively in the preceeding in-
formation, it should be clear that the wise
use of plastic garbage bags can enhance the
probability of survival in exposure cases by
stabilizing a victim's condition while await-
ing rescue. The early signs of exposure can be
treated and possibly reversed while the victim
conserves his energy and waits for assistance.
This, as opposed to a panicy headlong effort to
reach the entrance and leave the cave-often com-
pounding the problem. But of greatest importance
is the prevention of even the initial phases of
hypothermia-- a task made easier by the plastic bag.
