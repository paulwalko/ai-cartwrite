FALL/WINTER
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1973
Other people of interest include the mighty
Rolf McQuery, who is working with animals in the
Dublin area. In this manner he shall be capable
of further carrying on with his Big Walker moun-
tain project, Salamander project, and money pro-
ject, Tuna (less well known as Lawrence P. the
third) has graduated up from working under Mike
Frieders in Aerospace to finally working in the
field that he majored in. Yes, Tuna is now able
to play with his rocks. Last but not least (tho
he might be) Keith Ortiz has managed to roll the
great Beastie after over 400,000 miles of rugged
riding. He did it on 460, no less.
But what about those mighty VPI parties?
We partied. We partied at Russ Peterson's in New-
port News before the Altman's wedding. We partied
so hard that the police came and took Ed Loud,
Ed Richardson, and Jerry Redder away to the jail.
Imagine the police's surprise when eight more
drunks show up the next morning to bail out three
people arrested for being drunk in public. We
partied Halloween and nothing more need be said
except for the slight interference by the mad lad-
der climbers (see elsewhere). At New Year's at the
Ediger's we partied, too. The highlights of the
party were the facilities: a sauna and a meter-
deep pool. Fantastic. We also partied at the
VPI Banquet. Read about that elsewhere.
All the words in the list are re-
peated in the diagram. They may
run in all directionsup, down,
forward, backward, and diagonally.
The solution will appear in the
next issue. GOOD LUCK!
