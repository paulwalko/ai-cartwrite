Presently we turned off Crumps Ave
enue into a 2'x3' crawl, with a
deed body-thick slot in the floor.
After several hundred feet of this
garbage, we could even crawl on on

the Base Camp in Happy Crawl, a-
bout 1000 feet of crawling short
of Crump Avenue. Along the way,
we had passed film cans and "wat-
er -tight" bottles of carbide
that was left as caches two years
ago, and now largely turned to
white powder. At Base Camp, with
its 4-5 foot high ceilings and
dry sand floor, we unrolled the
camp's two dacron sleeping bags
to air, then crawled off about
500 feet to mop up 8 stations for
110 feet of crawlway.
Returning to Base Camp, we
ate a brief snack at the Happy
Crawl Restaurant, where a menu of-
fered beef strogonoff for $20.00.
Stripping down, we pulled the
sleeping bags onto plastic sheets
in the middle of the crawlway and
slid in. No matter if my bag
came up only to my armpits, it was
warm.
After a "night" of uneasy
sleep (we had no watch with us),
we awoke to a quick can of fruit.
Keith mentioned how my snoring
had sounded like a frieght train
in a tunnel. We each crammed
what we'd need this day into one
pack, then set off for Crump Ave-
nue, bound for the survey area.
After a tight, low section, we
popped out into Crumps Avenue, six
feet wide and fifteen feet high.
Shortly, Keith found a nice hole
to move his bowels into. Too
late I protested that in wet years
it drained into the heavily tr√†v-
After several hundred feet of this
garbage, we could even crawl an ane
side of the slot, not over it, and
finally we could put our packs back
on! From a nearby junction we
started mapping, eventually into a
maze of small blowing crawlways.
We ever.tually found one which was
the biggest. (Keith had overlooked
it the first time past it.) After
about four hundred feet of crawl
here, we came to the brink of a shear
six foot drop in the floor of the
passage, with no walls near below
and a waterfall audible in the
background. Sticking my head down
into the hole, I saw a room about
twenty feet wide and forty feet
long, with the waterfall out of
sight. Keith was itching to climb
down into this room, which was hu-
mongous compared to anything we'd
seen all day. The drop was through
a 12 inch wide slot, and I finally
convinced Keith that a climb out
under present circumstances would
be nearly impossible,
So we stopped there after 40
stations for 640 feet, and moved
back to the walking lead to con-
tinue the survey there. Sure e-
nough, it was walking passage, the
preverse "walking" passage typical
For the fourth consecutive
New Years holidays, I was to cave
in Crumps in Kentucky, but for the
first time since expedition-style
caving had been started last
April by cavers from the Cleveland
Grotto and the blid-Illinois trotto.
Keith Ortiz had flown up from Mex-
ico City for the occasion. I had
brand new coveralls for the trip.
and we each carried two full packs
into the cave crammed with food
and gear. Our ultimate destina-
tion was two hot ends of the sur-
vey east of North Crump Avenue,
one of these leads reported to be
walking passage.
After determining that no
one else would be in the cave while
we were, we entered and descended
the waterfall pitch near the en-
trance, getting rather wet in the
process, We had managed to delay
the start of the trip until 3:30
PM. With a day or two of rough
cave ahead, I was in no hurry to
enter. Crumps has developed the
habit of deterring people from
entering. After the 200 foot bel-
ly crawl in the rain swollen
stream, we signed in at the first
register, then proceded onto the
toll (254) ladder rigged for the
10 foot drop at Fishhook Falls,
only to discover that the climb
was in a waterfall. We decided
to take a drier alternate route
which added about 25 minutes to
the trip, and soon were back on
the planned route, now in the 800
foot long C Crawl. Through this
and beyond, we maintained a mod-
erate but steady pace, slower
than that last May, when I had
almost sweated myself into de-
salination, even with a minimum
of clothing on. I chuckled as I
remembered reading in The Caves
Beyond of the East Coast cavers
in the Flint Ridge crawlways, very
overdressed and cursing their
sweating. The dusty crawls in
Crumps are like those in flint
Ridge five miles away.
After three carbide change,
or about eight hours, we reached
