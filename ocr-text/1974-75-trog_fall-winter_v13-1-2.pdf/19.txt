FALL/WINTER

GATHRIGHT!
Our dismay is multiplied when we learn that
all this money is being spent on a dam that will
be obsolete before it is completed. Consider that
the pollution-dilution effect claimed as 40% of
the so-called benefit is now illegal.
This Fall, the VPI Cave Club, like many other
caving and conservation organizations, became in-
censed about the Gathright Dam Project in Bath and
Highland Counties, Virginia. Right after the fall
VAR meeting the situation was discussed by the
club. We voted to send a petition to Rep. Joe
dvins, Chairman, House Appropriations Committee,
Sub-Committee on Public Works, Rayburn Office
Building, Washington, D.C. 20515--head of the in-
vestigation of this project. Copies were also
forwarded to Rep. W.C. Wampler, 9th District of
Virginia; Sen. H.F. Byrd Jr. of Virginia; and to
Gerald Ford, President of the United States, AS
might have been expected, we have received no pe-
sponse as of yet.
To switch the outlawed environmental benefits
to recreational benefits is at best absurd. In
the region of the project there are more than ample
flat water recreation areas. On the other hand,
it will obliterate the Kincaid Gorge and flood
miles of the Jackson River Valley flowing through
the heart of the beautiful and rustic Gathright
Wildlife ivanagement area, an ideal recreational
area for outdoor enthusiasts and naturalists.
We are still hoping for the remote best, and
all concerned groups and individuals are urged to
join in this significant campaign, Thank You.
A copy of our letter follows:
Sir:
This brings us to a third point. The over
5,000 acres of the 18,000 acre wildlife manage-
ment area to be flooded are the absolutely essen-
tial food producing bottom lands. Loss of these
would make the wildlife area ecologically un-feas-
ible.
Finally, the very idea of attempting to build
a dam over an extensive network of caverns in ex-
tremely porous limestone is absolutely ludicrous.
We are shocked beyond belief that the Army Corps
of Engineers could create such a miscarriage of
basic engineering and elementary geology.
We, the undersigned members and friends of the
Virginia Polytechnic Institute Grotto of the Nat-
ional Speleological Society, feel that it is in- .
cumbent upon us as interested citizens to voice our
collective opinions on the Gathright Dam Project
now being investigated by Congress.
In these times of economic troubles we are
dismayed to learn that this less than half com-
pleted project already has a cost overrun of over
404%.
Hence, the entire Gathright Dam Project,
whether considered from an economic, ecologic,
environmental, engineering, esthetic, or recre-
ational aspect, is a shameful piece of planning
and a disgrace to our government. We Virginians
are indignant. We Americans are outraged. Please
do not let such a travesty continue.
