5-21-71 Well, I've finally fished that M.S. out
of the deep, dark cave waters. My 3 yr.
thesis is finally written--all 140 pages
of it, with 80 dollars worth of typing.
Ed Loud, just think of how many beers
that would buy! Now that its over, its
about time I started caving again.......
Here I am, on the way back from my typist
after discovering that a page number had
been skipped. Only 35 pages to retypel!

in school just to be a regular member

It was a dreary day as we partook to
climb the misty mountain in search of
long lost CAT-TRAP. Through thick fog
we ascended the lowly mountain to ask
of the crawly eye wherefor this chasm
might dwell. It told us to go to Hell.
We left broken hearted.
