"You people are crazy!", "what the hell--a
cable ladder?". These were some of the impres-
sions we received from members of the Holston Val-
ley Grotto when we met them between the Vault Room
and the bottom of Triple Wells. What else could
they say when they learned our plans? But I must
start this story with its proper chronological se-
quence.

self-belay once. By the time I reached the top,
won had sent Lor out to try to contact our Grotto
and tell them that we would not return by our sign
out time. Lor had left the cave approximately
90 minutes before our ETA. diy forearms were very
sore when I reached the top and Don said he had
experienced the same thing. We had both used our
legs climbing, but had used our arms to cling
close to the ladder. When Cheryl reached the top
after 32 minutes, she did not complain about her
arms. Instead, her complaint was that it took her
more time to climb out of Triple Wells than to
come out of Fantastic Pit.
With Lor gone, the three of us were faced
with the task of coiling 240 feet of rope and 203
feet of cable ladder. This took some time. Going
out, one man carried the rope, another had 3 of
Don Davison had come up to Blacksburg to at-
tend our Halloween celebration. He had heard that
ladders are used almost exclusively in Europe and
he wanted to give them a try. He was able to con-
vince Cheryl Jones, Lor Windle and myself to go
along with him. Two free loaders, Dob Alderson and
Rolf Mcduery, followed us to make use of our rope.
At the cave, we came upon the tail of the VG
troop descending the entrance, we exchanged greet-
ings and went our separate ways. Since each member
of our group knew the way, we travelled at our own
speed. Hauling 7 cable ladders and 240 feet of rope
through the stoopwalks and crawlways to Triple
wells was quite a task. By the time I showed up,
Don and Cheryl were already rigging the drop, so
Lor and I began to connect the ladders together.
Don descended first, taking about 14 minutes
to do so. Cheryl followed him down in about 13
minutes. Bob, Rolf, Lor and myself used the more
conventional technique, rapelling, to descend the
pit, Don and Cheryl both complained about sore-
ness in their forearms. While resting up before
climbing out, we signed the register and B.S.ed
with the people from HVG. Rolf and Bob left us
at this time to exit by way of Bill's Rappel. We
returned to Triple Wells.
The climb was belayed by a Gibbs ascenderon
a parallel rope. The Gibbs was attached by a sling,
through a chest safety, then attached to the seat,
For resting, we had a piece of sling with a biner
on the end attached to the seat. The idea was to
loop the sling over a ladder rung and then back to
the seat. I personally found this too cumbersome
an arrangement, so I just clipped the biner to a
rung to rest. This does put more stress on the
rungs than the sling arrangement would have, but
not enough to harm a well constructed ladder,
Don was the first to climb out. Stopping of
ten as the subject of many photographs, his time
on the ladder was 45 minutes. Lor started the
climb next. Soon, feeling quite tired, he began
complaining about the distance, Don yelled down
that he was already one-third of the way up. To
this Lor replied, "I may be one-third up, but I'm
two-thirds tired." Lor's elapsed time was close
to an hour.
AS I prepared to go up, I thought how foolish
I had been to party until 5:00 o'clock that morning.
It took me close to two hours to climb the 203 feet.
During that time, I fell asleep twice and tested my
the ladders, and the other had 4 ladders. Reali-
zing that we were now late, and if lor did not get
in touch with the Grotto, which was having its cel-
ebration on top of Brush mountain, we would have
a rescue coming after us
When we reached the bottom of the entrance drop
we noticed that the rope was gone. It appeared that
when HVG left the cave they had hauled our rope
out because it was in the way, then they had thrown
it back down the drop without checking to see if it
had fallen free to the bottom. It hadn't. The
rope not being there was just a nuisance as we
climbed up the drop to the rope, Don used the
rope with a self-belaying can. I rigged in with
two Gibbs and cammed out. Cheryl just climbed
all of the way.
By this time we were one hour past ETA. Lor
told us that he had asked R.E. Whittemore to try
to call the grotto to change our ETA. We figured
that if Whitt got in touch, we had no problem and
if he didn't, then being so late, somebody should
be looking for us. As it occurred, a rescue had
been formed and we intercepted it on our way back.
The experiences of climbing the Triple Wells
on a cable ladder was interesting, but I don't
think I'll do it again. It seems to take more
physical endurance to climb a ladder that distance
than to climb a rope, I would just as soon use
the rope.

But J.J. didn't have to be
rescued on the ladder. We'd
just as soon have him stick
to a good thing.
CONMENT FROM R.E. (Paraphrased): "Yeah, I
saw that the rope hadn't gone all the way
back down, and I should have gone down to
knock it free....but I was tired and thought
'if it was anyone in there besides Cheryl
and Don I would, but they can manage...'
