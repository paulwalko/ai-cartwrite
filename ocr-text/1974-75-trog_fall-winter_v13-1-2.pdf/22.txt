CALL/WINTER
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1975
Sphincter, stood before me. I felt
like a human suppository. Jan fol-
lowed. Looking over at the hole
through which the rope passed she
shook her head, "I hope they don't
give this place an enema while we're
in here." We held our breath, closed
our eyes and oozea through,
literally swallowed by a mud
flow. What continued on the
other side, however, was totally
out of character... Big Booming
Canyon... which also, unfor-
tunately soon ended in a pop-
corn pinch. Insult was, natur-
ally, added by a hint of air flow.
By this time Rick and Bob showed
up laughing, either out of hysteria,
or at our gullibility. We had
all had enough of this Mattachock
by then and so four mud coated
bodies emerged swearing never to
return.
looked bad. The only possible
access to the other side was along
the left wall on a slick flowstone
and mud crusted bulge which ap-
peared to deflate the longer one
looked at it. Luckily, however,
an alternate route was seen. If
one was to descend first to the
balcony below there seemed to be
a series of stalagmites and bumps
across which one may be able to
climb. We wouldn't even need to
bolt!
I finally set foot on the other
side I breathed a sigh of reliei.
My end of the line was tied off
and the most fantastic trolly in
south western Virginia came to be.
Bob Mead came across first as only
Bob could... "Why did you rig in
facing away from the wall Bob?" I
asked as he sat pinned between the
taught line and the wall... "Well...
in California..." He grinned
under his flashing glasses. Better
view no doubt. After contorting
himself out of his predicament
Bob Alderson followed leaving Don
and Paris to wait in the Fourth
of July Room.
Mind you I'm not a rock climb-
er nor do I profess to know one
damn thing about rock climbing, but
some how I was chosen to do the lead
climb. Once reaching the other side,
assuming my mind would still be stable
and sound, I would tie my end of
the belay line off. The others
would then come across along a true
tyrollean.
We headed off the balcony
through a small hole in some
breakdown and emerged into another
small room. Crawling cautiously
to the top of a tilting slab which
I had to return, however, for
I had promised capp Whittaker
photographs of his newly discovered
cave. So on July 28th I succeed -
ed in suckering Don Anderson and
Janet Queisser to partake of
wonderous Mattachock. I should
have known better than to anger
the spirits for, on this trip they
materialized and attempted to drop
a 200lb slab on my head, almost
ruining my camera.
Having only photographs in
mind we took a rather direct route
down Prophesy and back to what we
thought was the terminating room.
After a bit of poking about Don
noted a small hole in the breakdown
floor through which air current
flowed. It was a rather slimy
crawl but we continued into what
appeared to be real passage and
shortly to a small room. Again we
were at the bottom of a dome pit.
Again we could see a hole up top
and again there was no way to get
up there.
Two very tight leads branched
off the base of this room. I exam-
ined one side which led to wet
branching canyons, all of which
seemed to become too tight for
further exploration. Not feeling
in the mood for such miserable
material, I returned and, upon
meeting Don and .Janet , took a
few more pictures and exited what
was rapidly becoming a true suck
hole.
"The first obstacle encountered was a short drop of about 15'..."

Pondering the situation, I
decided to give Mattachock one last
try. So on August 18th, Bob
Alderson, Bob Mead-Donaldson, Don
Anderson, Paris-Troy Anderson
and myself once again returned.
Since all low passage seemed to be
leading us into wet rotten pinches
I wondered if, perhaps, the char-
acteristics of the cave were not
similar to Schoolhouse where one
must remain high in order to con-
tinue to the back of the cave.
Our goal then was to traverse across
Prophesy Pit, to the high passage
on the other side, Perhaps we could
also reach the top of those pits
in the rear of the cave, We fig-
ured that we would have to bolt
or at least use direct climbing
aids so we brought in enough gear
to climb El Cap.
How I started across the pit
I'll never know. My knees were
knocking so bad I thought the noise
would start a rock slide. With a
sling of carabiners, pitons and
chocks across my shoulder, I pro-
ceeded. All I needed was a pair
of knickers and an old briar pipe.
When my first hand hold disinte-
grated I just about died. I was
being belayed from the top of the
pit so, at worst, I would only
pendulum back to my starting point
but I still couldn't put that
ominous dark mass out of my mind,
As and ara hold dis I wa
made up the floor of the room we
realized that we were simply sit-
ting atop another pit. Finding
the slab to be only about six
inches thick and composed of rotten
flakes and mud gave us a rather
uneasy feeling. Passage again
could be seen across the pit.
Not having enough rope to descend
the full length of the drop I
decided to go ahead and attempt
to pendulum over to it. After
hanging on the rope for thirty
minutes trying every conceivable
procedure for reaching my des-
tination I finally tied a large
knot in the remainder of the rope
which hung below. With this make-
shift grapling device I threw it
across, into the passage, hoping
to snag on some rocks. At last
Luckily the climb was not
nearly as difficult as it first
appeared. My major concern was
whether my holds would stay in
place. Most of them didn't. As
When we reached the pit things
