A reliable, semi-permanent, webbing seat har-
ness is valuble in vertical ropework and climb-
ing. When the Appalachian Search and Rescue Con-
ference was analyzing existing designs for both
training and search and rescue operations, none
were found to be acceptable. For example, the
single-loop seat is connected in front by a
carabiner after one inserts one's posterior in-
to the loop. The carabiner snaps onto a bight
of loop from between the legs and a bight from
each side. The three resulting sections, about
the waist and each leg, easily shift and can con-
strict in one section while being too loose in
another. It is easy to fall out of when inverted. .
Also, if the webbing fails, by cutting or abrad-
ing, at only a single point, the entire system
disintergrates immediately, and the wearer falls.
The typical swiss-seat' is a webbing waist
loop with an overhand knot in front. The ends
drop between the legs, separately pass around op-
posite legs and return to the front. One end
crosses the front, taking a turn around the over-
hand knot, and ties, on the opposite hip, to the
other end. This design also permits shifting of
position, constriction and loosening of sections,
and failure if cut at any one point. However,
these problems do not occure with the speed en-
countered in the single-loop. The swami-belt'
consists of two non-fixed leg loops connected to
several waist wraps. Again, the movable leg
loops can constrict, and the system can fail if
cut at a single point. "
There is considerable value in a simi-per-
manent seat harness. It can remain partially
tied and be quickly donned, often by different
people. The permanent sewn rig is put on faster
and is more reliable, but is a single use item,
often fits only one individual, and requires
skill and special materials to produce. The
semi-permanent rig can be converted to countless
other uses, including a simple handline by just
untieing it, and is preferable in the majority of
light-duty vertical endeavors.
Since the ASRC did not find any of the exist-
ing designs acceptable, a design was created to
meet what were considered to be reasonable safety
and performance criteria for light and medium
duty vertical situations.
Start with approximately 20 feet of 1 inch
wide tubular nylon webbing. Tie a bowline in one

just large enough to slide over the left thigh
(see Fig. 1).
RAPPEL
After adjusting the first bowline as specifed,
tie another bowline about 3 inches away. In each
bowline, the standing part of the webbing
is the crosspiece between the knots (see Fig. 2).
The second bowline should be the same size as the
first. Next, with the remaining webbing to the
right, place the first bowline on the left leg.

each side. Connect the locking carabiner as usual
around the crosspiece and wraps.
When removing the seat, leave the bowlines
tied to simplify future use. However, the semi-
permanent nature of the seat allows use as a
handline by untising.
Unlike most other seats, the ASCR seat must
be cut or broken in at least two places to release
the wearer. If tied correctly, the crosspiece is
protected from wear by the turns of the wraps.
Also, the leg loops will not tighten on the legs,
cutting off circulation, nor will it fall down
while walking. If properly applied, it is not
possible for one to fall out of the seat when
