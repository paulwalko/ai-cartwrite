It happened on a certain Feb-
ruary night when the legions that
hold allegiance to the VPI Grotto
met down in Blacksburg to become
reunited in the wild festivities
that have become known as the VPI
Banquet. This extravaganza occur-
red on February first, in the year
of our Lord (no, I do not mean the
great gd Loud) nineteen hundred and
seventy-five. It was the tenth an-
nual Banquet celebration (or should
that be "conflagration"?) and it
was held in the Red Lion Inn off
460 at 7:00 o'clock (if you weren't
there, then HUMPH!). The food was
not spactacularly incredible, but
it was all you could eat and it was
very edible. Personally, I rather
enjoyed it (and made a hog-body of
myself). Quite delicious.

of ourselves at this feast, we
were enchanted by slides and stories
as presented to us by Sara Corrie.
She gave us a pictorially discrip-
tive account of her adventures in
the underground, Everyone found
these tales to be interesting and
Sara was resoundingly awarded with
a hearty cheer and ciap when her
exploits had been recounted. That

up the high esteem and reputation
that these renowned post-Banquets
have created, I speak now of the
awards ceremony, the time when all
good people look to their just re-
wards and all enemies of the people
cringe in fear and terror of the
awesome retribution that they know
will await them. Thus it was at
this last Banquet. The awards com-
mittee had worked and conived with
devious craft to ferret out those
which deserved to be recognized for
their good deeds and those which
would be recognized in ignominious
