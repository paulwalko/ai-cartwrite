This, again, could be another source

The morning of June 29th fell
head first into the pattern that
Walker Mountain trips seemed to
have spelled out... a fiasco. Sev-
eral ridge walking trips before
had yielded three totally virgin
caves. In fact, there hadn't been
one trip to date that did not yield
something new. The fact that none
of these finds really amounted to
all that much didn't really seem
to deter the thousand people who,
with the smell of success about,
wished to try their luck. Then
again, perhaps it was just a good
day for a walk and indeed it was.
The members of the party were
Janet Queissar, Jan Davis, Rick
Whitt, Bob Alderson, Bob Mead-Don-
aldson, Lor Windle and myself.
However, Janet and Jan were going
to map with Glen Davis and Bill
Douty further down the ridge at
Bane's. The five of us, then, set
out to comb the slopes of Walker
and, by the end of the day, thought
that our good luck trend in cave
hunting had, at last, diminished.
Were we ever wrong.
Cave. The remainder of the day was
uneventful and unproductive except
for one "insignificant" find.
Traveling along the shale- lime-
stone contact, I was becoming
increasingly tired and frustrated
as our efforts seemed to be fal-
ling more and more to futility.
Coming up the side of a shallow
swell I caught sight of a small
outcrop about fifty feet from the
edge of a field. Nothing really
exciting about it. Its only feature
was a small hole about the size
of my fist. As one looked clos-
er, however, it was seen that
this was no common, drab, every
day hole. A small leaf quivered
just inside. I poked it and
watched as it disappeared into
darkness. Lor looked up, his
left eye twitching... "It sucks"
he said, "That hole sucks."
"Ah, yes" I replied as I dropped
another leaf to watch it pop
through the slit and be drawn out
of sight. By this time the remain-
der of the group had arrived and
began crouching aside the hole,
feeding it more leaves. Finally,
through laughter and tears we came
to the realization that Walker
Mountain had central vacuum clean-
ing and moved on along the ridge.
Nothing more was found and, at
sunset, we left with tired feet
and nothing promising to look for-
ward to.
for reasons which still puzzle me,
four of us returned; our intentions
being to dig and pry that literal
rat hole apart and find out just
what was behind its peculiar be-
havior. Bob Alderson, Rabbit Dix-
on, Jan Davis and myself thus ar-
ived at Capp Whittaker's place
early that afternoon and obtained
permission to continue our endeavor
Pick and pry-bar in hand, we
set out, gorging ourselves with
perfectly ripe blackberries along
the way. Suprisingly, we had
little trouble respotting the slit.
It certainly didn't appear any
larger the second time around, but
thrusting a leaf toward it again
sparked hope as it was immediately
swallowed. We worked for about
two hours prying and placing chock
stones. Progress was indeed slow
and we weren't rewarded in the
least by any peek at possible pas-
sage ahead. One couldn't help
but think that we were simply run-
ning into a pinch between two slabs
of solid rock. We must have real-
ly had nothing better to do, how-
ever, for we continued. Most of
It had rained for a few days
before but today it was clear and
warm. As we sat on an old one lane
bridge over Walker Creek deciding,
where to begin we thought it not
a bad idea to scratch the original
plan and go tubing instead, on
down to Foplar Hill. Being too
lazy, however, to retrieve our
tubes from Blacksburg we began up
the ravine to the west of Salamander
