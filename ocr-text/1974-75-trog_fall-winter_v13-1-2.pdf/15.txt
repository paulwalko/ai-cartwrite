FALL WINTER

Cave hunting is done in many
different ways, depending upon the
people involved. At VPI, vertical
caving is rather popular, and thus
many cavers comb steep mountain-
sides in search of vertical caves.
My own tastes run to mud and water
So I stay low in the valleys when
looking for new caves. My exper-
ience in the midwest tells me that
springs and overflow openings are
good places to find extensive cave
passages. The following trip re-
ports should indicate the luck I
am having in Virginia.
Walker Creek loops out of the
generally unspeleogenic Knox dolo-
mite and into the Chatham Hill
limestone at the foot of Big Walk-
er Mountain just before joining
Little Walker Creek. I predicted
a spring where the creek and the
limestone met. In mid June, Bob
mead, Rolf McQueary and I went
looking for it. On the way there
Bob remembered seeing a spring in
the vicinity while on an earlier
canoe trip. We did find a size-
able Spring there, about -1 cubic
feet per second. When Rolf tried
to follow the water underground,
he was confronted with only a few
inches of air. Thirty minutes of
removing rocks from the spring
lowered the water level eight in-
ches. We entered to find walking
passage seven feet high and eight
feet wide, ending in breakdown.
The water welled up from one wall -
a siphon. Total passage length
was about a hundred feet.
In mid October, I was work-
ing in the area a mile north of
New Castle Murder Hole. Meadow
Creek drains 3-4 square miles,
then sinks and reappears 6500
feet away at Dudding Spring, as
verified by die tracing. A loc-
al reported a cave about a thous-
and feet from the spring, in the
direction of the sinking spot 01
Meadow Creek. This area appears
to have been well covered by VPI
cave hunters--up on the hill that
is. The cave I had been directed
to wasn't known, though. I walk-
ed into the quarry according to
directions, and found an overflow
entrance. Ten feet inside was a
major stream, 1-1 cubic feet per
second, undoubtedly the under-
ground portion of Meadow Creek.
Twenty feet downstream was a break-
down choke, caused no doubt by
quarry blasting, which I couldn't
get through. I pulled rocks loose
to lower the water level upstream.
Then I turned around and headed
upstream, ready for the mile of
passage between me and the sinks
of Meadow Creek. I walked through
sand and mud two feet deep, fill-
ing my boots, in passage seven
feet high and ten wide. One hun-
dred and thirty feet upstream from
the entrance, the ceiling dropped
and the water got real deep--it
siphoned!
In mid November, still dry
weather, I traveled to Hamilton
Cave, where Walker Creek again
loops into the foot of Big Walker
Mountain, and just misses inter-
secting the Chatham Hill lime-
stone. Hamilton Cave has some
humongus passage, 45 feet wide
and 25 feet high in places. The
entrance is on a bluff, a hun-
dred feet above the creek. On
the hillside below the entrance,
a large spring appears out of the
rubble which covers the hillside.
piled next to a ledge. I spent
over two hours throwing rocks out
from under the ledge, lured on by
the inflowing breeze and visions
of more giant passage. Finally I
squeezed into the blackness to
reach the stream which feeds the
spring, flowing about cubic feet
per second. I looked upstream to
see in the distance a wide pool
and hear rapids. But the rapids
that were making noise were down-
stream, and the twenty foot wide
pool wag--a siphon A low crawl
to the right led to a cobble fill
almost to the ceiling. The total
length was 60 feet. The breeze
must have been drawn to the high-
er Hamilton Cave through impassa-
ble openings. Vertical measure-
ments indicated that the floor of
the entrance passage in Hamilton
Cave is only 20 feet above the low
pool level in the spring cave, a-
parently in the same beds. In
nigh water, backup from the spring
probably creates the seasonal
pools that are known in Hamilton
Cave.
So I'm 0 and 3 in pushing
springs and overflows in Virgin-
ia. I know of another overflow
near Wolf Creek that needs to be
dug out, and I'll bet it will si-
phon. I'm still waiting to break
the big one here in Virginia.
Take me back to old Kentucky!

Twenty feet higher, I could still
hear the stream through the rubble
