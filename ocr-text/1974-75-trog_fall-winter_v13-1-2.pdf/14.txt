ers work by the action of Quater-
nary Ammonium Salts. These salts
adhere to the surface coating.
This coating is very slick, and a-
llows the fibers to slip past each
other with very little friction.
This lubricating effect increases
the flexibility of the material
which people interpret as being
softer when in reality it is only
more flexible. The ammonium salts
have no harmful effect on nylon,
and the use of fabric softeners on
ropes is quite advantageous.
The softerner's coating on
the surface of the rope causes it
to feel waxy, but it wears off
very quickly. The first person to
rappol on a rope treated with fab-
ric softener will notice it is
quite slick, but by the third rap-
pel, it will not be noticeable.
Besides making the rope more flex-
able, softeners have other advan-
tages. That portion which pene-
trates to the core of kernmantle
ropes lubricates the minute fila-
ments and helps keep them from a-
brading on each other while the
rope is flexing. The softener al-
80 forms a barrier between the
rope!s nylon fibers and dirt par-
ticles. All the good quality
softeners (e.g. Downy) are effec-
tive on nylon. If you are afraid
you will miss the final rinse cy-
cle, use a softener such as John-
son's Rain Barrel which can be
added initially with the soap.
Alter washing, the rope should be
dried before storage. While dry-
ing the rope in a dryer would be
acceptable (if the drum doesn't
get too hot), it is much better to
hang the rope in the air to drip
dry.
by gasoline, anti-freeze, beer, bat
guano, urine, whiskey, brake fluid
or oil. It is inert to all foods
that are edible by humans. It is
difficult to find a substance that
will attack a nylon rope around
your home or while out caving.
Specific chemical resistance data
on many substances is available

ther questions.
A most appealing feature of
nylon ropes to cavers is the fact
that they do not rot or deterior-
ate from exposure to water how-
ever this is a very misunderstood
phenomenal There is an interac-
tion between nylon and water and
your rope's physical properties
are highly dependent upon the a-
mount of water entrapped within
the polymer structure. This may
seem confusing, but the nylon fil-
aments have small spaces between
the molecular chains that form
them. The amide structure has an
affinity for water, and small num-
bers of water molecules penetrate
the nylon filaments to fill these
open spaces. While many physical
properties such as modulus of e-
lasticity, abrasion resistance,
melt softening temperature, and
flexural fatigue are also affect-
ed by the percent of absorbed
water, we will dwell mainly on
its effect of tensile strength.
Nylon has such a high affinity for
water that after manufacture, it
is never dry. The types of nylon
used to manufacture rope come to
equilibrum in a 50% relative humid-
ity atmosphere when they contain
about 2.5% absorbed moisture.
This water is absorbed directly
from the air and there is no way
to prevent it. Most manufactures'
specifications l'or nylon ropes
are based on ropes in which the
nylon polymer has 2.5% absorbed
moisture. This is about what
your rope has if you store it a-
round the house. The problem is
that as the moisture content of
nylon polymers increases, its
tensile strength decreases rapid-
ly. I had not given this much
thought until I heard some peop-
le advocating soaking ropes in
water before doing long rappels
to help prevent the rappel de-
vices from overheating. I have
discussed this with technical
representatives from several ma-
jor nylon manufacturing firms,
and they all felt it was a bad
idea. The water saturation
point of nylon filaments the size
used for rope nanufacture is
reached in a matter of minutes,
and the tensile strength of the
polymer is drastically reduced.
(See graph) Because of this
fact, the use of standing ropes
in wet drops should be discour-
aged, as well as the practice of
saturating ropes before use. It
could be that cavers have been
very lucky thus far that a water
soaked rope hasn't broken. I
hope our rope suppliers will test
some saturated ropes in the near
future and shed some more light
on this subjecto
Heat too is a potential en-
emy on nylon ropes. People are
very concerned about overheating
rappel devices on long pitches.
The problem is that nylon, like
most polymers, does not have a
sharply defined range of temper-
ature at which it is usable.
Nylon filaments used for rope
manufacture can withstand 180°F
air exposure indefinitely with-
out degradation. At 2400F, they
degrade in a matter of minutes.
The real question though, is
just how hot can a rappel device
become while in contact with the
rope. This depends upon the
pressure and time at the point of
contact. A 180 pound caver ap-
plies almost 70 psi load on the
rope in the areas contacted by
the brake bars during rappel,
At this loading, nylon can with-
stand just over 3000F before
softening to break under the
load. The thermal conductivity
of nylon rope is so low that if
the sheath were in contact with
a 300°F brake bar long enough and
enough pressure were applied to
melt the surface, the rope 1/8"
away would still be near ambient
temperature. While this in no
way solves the heat problem, it
does show that if the rappel de-
vice overheats and fuses a sec-
tion of the sheath while moving
on Blue Water, it still retains
nearly 92% of its initial strength.
This is considerably more than a
water-soaked rope with the same
initial temperature. Further
field testing will be required
before specific recommendations
concerning safe rappel device
temperatures can be made.

as its temperature increases (see
