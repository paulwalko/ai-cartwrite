Dry Cave: A WVACs Saga
By: Nick Socky
| vividly remember my first adventure into Dry Cave. First off, as most people know Dry
Cave is not in any way shape or form "dry". I sometimes use the phrase like "Smokehole on Ster-
oids" or "you're going to want a wet suit or a waffle suit" to describe Dry. This cave located in
West Virginia, about 30 min drive from WVACs, and is by far one of the most fun, epic, exhaust-
ing, cold, wet, and beautiful caves I have ever been to. It was work weekend in February and
the temperature outside was barely just above freezing. I luckily was wearing my membrane waf-
fle suit or as my caving companions renamed "dragon suit" so I was prepared and not too wor-
ried about getting cold. Even then though, it proved to be a freezing trip. The trip consisted of
Rebecca Stewart, Joe Calderone, Greg Springer, and me. If I recall correctly we entered the
cave a little bit before noon after crossing (the frigid and chest deep in places) Anthony Creek
twice. So we entered the cave and instantly began the crawl which includes going through the
very comfortable "Williams Wiggle". From the 100 to 200 feet entrance crawl series, you open up
into the downstream sump room. From here you enter the water immediately and depending on
the weather over the past few weeks, the water can be either ankle deep or nearly waist deep.
This time it was only thigh
deep. We started up
stream trudge which in-
cludes 2 or 3 duck-
unders which involve
getting your belly wet,
and a few upper dry by-
passes which were quite
pleasant. Greg was
leading us to a survey
before the blow-hole
gallery in some of the up-
per levels.
