Cave Documentation
By Nick Socky
In order to get your membership with the VPI Cave Club, one of the requirements is to remain a prospective member
for at least 10 weeks during which time/he/she/it must spend at least 40 hours underground on at least 6 club trips. It seems
that most of the prospective members seeking membership (even me when I was!) do a poor job of initial documentation of
which caves they went to, with who, and for how long. I recall right before I was voted in, I spent several hours going through
all the sign out sheets at sign out to see which trips I had been on, who was the leader/member on the trip, and how long I was
caving for, and then running around all of Blacksburg trying to get the signatures for those trips! The simplest way to prevent
this from happening is to just carry the cave trip sign off sheet with you to every cave you go to, and have a member sign you
off on the trip once you get out of the cave. But some people may want to document further, and continue documenting as well!
So below I have created a tutorial, with included examples of how to make a Cave Trip Data Base in Microsoft Excel, just like
mine!
An image of the basic template is included below. This is the sheet 1 excel sheet. It includes the date you went caving,
which cave you went to, who was on the trip, how long the trip was, which state and county the cave is in, number of bats you
saw in the cave, and then lastly the trip quote and additional notes you wish to add about the cave. The only excel math needed
here is simple. For the total hours, click cell D14, then up on the fx bar type in =SUM (D8:D13). This will calculate all the
hours you have been underground. Then to set the same total in cell C4, click cell C4 and in the fx bar and enter =D14. This
will link these two cells together to be equal. Now you can do the same exact process for the Bat Count: Click cell G14, and
then type in the fx, =SUM (G8:G13), and then click C5 and enter into the fx, =G14. If you want to add a cave to the list and
keep math, simply right click on row 14 and then click on insert. It should move all the totals down one row and allow you en-
tire all the new data, keeping the math and adding to the summation. Lastly, you need to add the total trips. To do this, click on
cell C4 and enter into the fx, =Sheet2! D28. This will call cell D28 from the second sheet. Next, I will show you how to do some
more details cave documentation! To make it match up with cell C4 you need to follow exactly the same template below!
