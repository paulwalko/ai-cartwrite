So, can the Carrick bend perform better than an awkward knot that kills people? You bet
it can!
The Carrick bend is beautiful, secure, and unjammable even when wet. When it capsizes,
it doesn't turn into a slip knot, it just becomes stronger. It even maintains more of the rope
strength than a square knot. Sound pretty good? Let's see what Ashley has to say: "The
Carrick Bend [...] is perhaps the nearest thing we have to a perfect bend." (pg. 262,
#1439).
Straight from the horse's mouth. But that's not all! Among its "array of excellencies" is that
"It is symmetrical, it is easy to tie, ... it is amongst the strongest of knots, it cannot jam, and it
is readily untied." The only bad thing he has to say about it: it's "somewhat bulky."
The Carrick bend can also be faster to tie. For instance, when you're tying a square knot in
the middle of 30 feet of webbing, you have to pull 15 feet of webbing through the knot
two times in a row. The Carrick bend requires only one pull-through. The Carrick bend is
quantitatively better than the square knot in another way: it is more secure when subject
to shock loads. A square knot slips after an average of 19.6 shocks, as compared to 70.8
for the Carrick bend. (Ashley pg. 273). And the Carrick bend is also more versatile. It is
commonly used in net-making due to its ability to hold two ropes crossing each other at
right angles. It can also be tied as a load-releasing knot, with a pull-cord to easily untie it
even while under load.
