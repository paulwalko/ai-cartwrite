The Bat Ranch
By Caroline Shea
I was warned about these parties, many said that I would quickly learn the male anatomy in great detail. To be
on the safe side I brought an entourage. I've already been on the road for 20 minutes. My group was already
pretty weary of their decision to come with me, nothing a little alcohol can't fix, and on the ride we made a
drinking game out of my horrible navigation skills. Every time I made a wrong turn they all got to drink. An-
other 20 minutes goes by and finally I see the oversized aluminum mail box becoming me.
I introduced myself as a trainee to the eclectic people outside and shuffled in, every inch of the house was cov-
ered in something atypical. I counted at least 20 animals and at least 100 tie dye things I met a few others
around the kitchen table, I wasn't sure what all the fuss was about. Besides the eclectic art and the animals this
seemed so far like a typical college hang out. WHERE WERE THE NAKED PEOPLE? Courtney advised that I
walk out back to the bon fire. I huddled with my posy and led them around back. We walked through a second
room filled with cage after cage of eclectic animals. A door at the end of this animal sanctuary directed us to
the backyard. The smell of wood burning caught my nose. A light show was hitting the steam in the air that
rose from an aluminum bowl perched next to a shed. The colors of light danced through the air and against the
naked steamy backs of those enjoying the hot tub. The hot tub had a very convoluted shape. I found myself
wondering what shape it was it and convinced myself it probably looks like a penis from an aerial view.
My entire group flocked to the fire, keeping our distance from the naked people. It is our understanding that a
person should not talk to another person when their clothes are off. We quickly realized that this was not the
case for these cavers. Nudity is a conversation starter, its normal, welcomed, encouraged. No amount of warn-
ing could have prepared me for the cultural shock. I carried a thirty pack of Busch beer and made friends with
the various people around the fire. Roughly 20 minutes of chatting abounding the fire went by. It seemed like
there were two realms in the backyard, the nudists at the hot tub, and the clothed people at the fire. I must
have been staring at feet for a while, or maybe I was just zoned out, but when I looked up again there was a
flaccid penis staring at me from across the fire. I don't who it was, but I'm pretty sure that image will be
burned into my brain for the rest of eternity. Someone had their hands on their hips with their pelvis pushed
out making their dick that much closer to the crimson flames between us. Welcome to cave club!
About 10 feet from the fire was an old piano. It was partially illuminated by a spot light overhead and from
the soft orange glow of the fire. It was by far the creepiest piano I have ever seen. One of my friend's, Katy,
boldly went to see if it worked. All I could think was that it was filled with little gremlins that were going to
swallow her whole. Apparently that piano is going to go up in flames at the next Bat Ranch event in April.
There is no way in hell I would miss watching that demonic piano going up in flames.
