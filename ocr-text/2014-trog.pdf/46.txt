The Saga of Sergeants
By Amy Skowronski
It was raining when we pulled up to the barn where we were expected to park. So, not unlike Coco Chanel, we fashioned a very
haute couture piece that we called the Trash Bag Burqa, which can be worn to stay dry when you need to hike twenty minutes
in the rain to get to your cave. This is worn because being wet and cold and miserable when you enter the cave will make the
cave jealous since its job will have already been done. Be extra careful when walking in the burqa – your arms are inside the
bag holding your pack so if you trip and fall, you will seriously eat it since you are top-heavy. Also, be wary of diverging from the
trail in an attempt to get to the cave faster. It's common knowledge that as soon as a caver ventures into the woods, friendly and
thoughtful prickle bushes will sprout immediately to help catch them if they tumble downslope. If you choose to go off-trail whilst
wearing the burqa, beware of the fate that may befall you.
A few feet into the entrance there were bones. No doubt they were there to serve as a warning for the passage that had yet to
present itself. When the Fearless Leader Wil says that the lead he found has a little bit of a popcorn crawl that's really not so
bad, be leery - he's being misleading. Despite this, go to his lead because it could be well worth the trouble. In this particular
case, it was.
We found the survey station we were supposed to work from and the profanity began immediately. After we got through a cou-
ple of climb-downs with surprisingly little trouble, we patted ourselves on the back. It was quickly apparent that we had congratu-
lated ourselves far too soon, because here began the dreaded crawl. The passage led us to a room with a small (tiny) canyon do
the left that was composed entirely of popcorn on both sides with little ledges jutting out erratically at random angles. It seemed
as though these protrusions of rock were very purposefully placed to prevent humans from ever entering this part of the cave,
but we powered through and continued the survey. If you ever find yourself in this sort of situation, I offer you my sympathies.
But as you press your face against a wall of popcorn and contort your body to fit a tight and awkward canyon while you try to
read instruments, remind yourself that you are do-
ing this for fun. Swearing with reckless abandon at
the previously unnoticed rocks that jab you in the
ribs is highly and greatly encouraged.
We were very excited when it opened up big
enough to sit up all the way. Upon explaining this to
coworkers who still ask if it's “spelunking” and
watching the look of horror on their faces I have
come to the conclusion that feeling relief and joy at
being able to sit upright is not normal.
