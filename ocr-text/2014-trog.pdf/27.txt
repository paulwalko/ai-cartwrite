spectfully.
Ray Sira was given a mask award for his Halloween money costume.
Nick”Peppy”Socky and Tommy Polson were given the Vertical Techniques Award for hav-
ing to be rescued out of “Lesson Learned Cave”, As Tommy said, "I know how to arm rappel,
but not how to Batman.”
On a more somber note, Cecile James and Pam Mohr were remembered due to their jour-
ney to the huge trunk passage. They will be greatly missed. Many glasses were lifted to
their memory. Carol Zo presented a photo collage of Pam, made by Courtney Trost to Kirk
Digby.
Trainee of the year was handed out by Courtney to John Echols. It proves that being a
trainee for 5 years, really pays off.
The A.I.Cartwright Honorarium was given to Jim Washington for his many years of ser-
vice to the Club. Thank you, Jim.
Dancing then ensued until the wee hours to the music of a wonderful dj.
