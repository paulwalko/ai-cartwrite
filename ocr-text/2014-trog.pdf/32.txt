SPRING HOLLOW
By Tommy Cleckner
Towards the end of January, I got the chance to cave someplace VPI rarely
goes to: Spring Hollow. Bill Kershner led the trip; he wanted a chance to resurvey
sections of the cave. It was a small trip. There were five of us: Bill, Peppy, Joe
and Carol Zokaites, and then obviously yours truly. Bill had laid some ground-
work with the land owner before the trip. He'd gone out, (re)introduced himself
and just generally reminded them that the VPI Grotto was still around and very
much interested in caving on their property in return for a little bit of labor. So
we rolled out to the field Sunday morning and got to work.
After trekking up and down in the snow for a while looking for the hole
(isn't that the worst?), we started to find and cut up enough wood to cover the
entrance. The landowner wanted it covered so calves wouldn't fall in come
spring; wood will work long enough to last until then, and when we put in some-
thing more permanent we'll have an excuse to cave again. As with any task in-
volving engineers, the project quickly blossomed into a two-hour affair. Carol and
Bill wanted to know if we were building the Taj Mahal; clearly they don't appreci-
ate craftsmanship.
With foreplay over, we all enthusiastically
climbed in. It wasn't just that we wanted to go cav-
ing; it was also really cold. It took a little while to
get everyone in though; the ~10 foot down climb
was both muddy and icy. Soon enough we moved
away from the entrance and into the cave proper. It
was a really fun cave to move through; there were
climby bits every twenty or twenty-five feet. We
stayed in what I believe was the upper level of the
cave; we passed a ~45 foot nuisance drop through a
waterfall into what I'm told is long passage filled
with beautiful formations. Pretty soon we reached a
long corridor, the entrance of which was composed
of huge breakdown blocks. The stream joined it
there; and there was plenty of mud and some easy
crawling. We stopped at another short drop, and
made our way back.
