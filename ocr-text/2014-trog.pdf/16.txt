2:36pm-Ray parks on the bank. Peppy's car follows. Peppy's car, unhappy with life, decides it would
like to take a swim. The passengers abandon ship and get out to assess the crisis.
3:12pm- Peppy's car remains on the bank for the time being, ready to take the plunge at any mo-
ment. The crowd on the island notices and begins gawking.
3:24pm- Various plans to move the car are discussed. The car is tied back to several trees for safety.
3:32pm- Mike Newsome bravely attempts to drive the car out of the situation. The car slides another
foot closer to the river.
3:46pm- A group heads back to the Bat Ranch to recover the high jack. Others continue to disassem-
ble the float in the water and transfer the tubes and plywood to shore.
4:21pm- Mike stands underneath the car to rig the high jack. We all hold our breaths.
4:30pm-7:50pm- The car moves one inch at a time sideways, away from its suicide attempt. Some
people build a fire. Those of us who could not find any way to be useful huddle by the fire. Others
work diligently deflating tubes.
8:00pm- We rejoice as Peppy's car is safely in an upright position with all four wheels on solid ground.
8:12pm-10:00pm- We load the cars with the remains of our beloved float.
11:00pm-Everyone is back at the Bat Ranch, starving and exhausted. We celebrate by crashing hard.
