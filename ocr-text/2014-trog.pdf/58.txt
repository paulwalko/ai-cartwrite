How to organize a YTR of your very own! (You dumb bastard)
By John Echols
I sincerely hope each and every one of you had a
blast at our joint Young Timers Reunion (YTR) and fall
Virginia Regional event (VAR) this past September!
Over 190 people showed up for the weekend event
which was a caving and financial success. If you are
interested in knowing how to organize a similar
event in the future, curious about what goes on be-
hind the scenes at caving events, or just want to
laugh at my fuckups, then this article is for you!
Step 1: Inspiration or “We should do this
all the time!"
Maybe you enjoyed the last VAR, TAG, or convention
and you want to get involved in the next step. May-
be you had a by-chance gathering of cavers and want
to recreate that atmosphere in a bigger setting.
Maybe you think you can make this year's YTR way better than that shit they put on last year. Regardless, you're ready to throw
the best damn event in the history of caving. Awesome! Hold on to that enthusiasm and the rest of the process will go much
smoother than if you don't.
Step 2: Planning or “Everything will come together pretty well on its own, right?"
It's pretty daunting when you realize everything that's actually required to successfully carry out even a small caving event. If
you get to the planning phase and don't feel a little overwhelmed, you're probably doing it wrong. Here's a list of shit that needs
to get done (in the best order I can figure) to actually put on these events.
Generate Interest
These events are not one-man operations. You're going to need help and lots of it. Advertise at the club meeting what
you're doing and why it's going to be awesome. Enthusiasm is contagious.
Start having meetings every couple weeks so that those who are interested can input their ideas and suggestions. You'll
probably end up with a small core of people who are just as excited as you are and want to be very involved. These idi
ots people are the most important part of the planning process. Treat them like the heroes that they are.
Decide on a target attendance and pick a date.
Decide early on who you're catering to. The answer for this may simply be cavers!' but you need to know your audience so
you can set a date that doesn't conflict with other major interests of that group. For example, you may be planning an
event for students from different universities in the
fall. It's useful to know that all football teams don't
