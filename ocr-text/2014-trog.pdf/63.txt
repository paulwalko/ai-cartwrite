Peter's Rules to Caving
By Peter Southworth
Once upon a time, there was a faraway land with exotic features and people, where everything was differ-
ent. This land is West Virginia. A few weeks ago I took part in my first 8 or so hour cave trip plus hour long
hike, and boy was it a doozy, and during this time I've come up with a series of rules per-say on caving that
would serve any caver well, and would help them be a better caver by 420%.
First and foremost never buy kneepads. As you cave you'll learn there is
no greater satisfaction then crawling on hard stones and at the same
time slowly letting you knees get crushed to look like they just got
out of a meat grinder. As well for all the men out there women love
battle scars so this would give you the opportunity to flaunter your-
self over and show your love interest, your newly created ground
meat that you would call knees.
The second rule is that gloves are never necessary. As you cave you'll want to
aru AS VOLVO VOU'll want to show off those bruises!
immerse yourself into being one with the cave and what a better way of doing that then getting in
touch literally with the cave itself. As well by the end of the trip you will feel satisfaction as you look
at your hands and realize they look like they just came out of a saw movie, and once again back to
number 1 chicks dig battle scars (Yes caving is a battle).
The third rule is, boots are unnecessary and always cave in name-brand clothes. There is a time in eve-
ry person's life where they will realize that caving is a luxury and like all luxuries must be done in
style. So take out your 50$ plus name-brand clothes and go be comfy in a cave. As well who needs
boots when your can wear perfectly good sneakers. Not only are they easy to wear, but also give
air to your feet, and depending on the cave makes you feel like you're at a water park as you slip
and slide around. Also sneakers allow for the fun job of coming right of in the case of sticky mud
completely alleviating the feeling of stickiness it is pure gold.
This next rule is very important as it helps both you and others, and that is to not bring a change of
clothes. You see this one is pure gold because then it requires that you borrow someone else's
clothes and thereby are bonding with them creating stronger friendships, and or you just drive
home dirty sharing your cave mud with the person's car allowing an even stronger cave bond to
form.
My final tip is to always get the dimmest light possible. This
will in turn allow you to stay focused on going through the
cave as you can't see anything than a small space in front of
you. As well it allows you to adopt night vision, and even in
some cases learn echo location like a bat.
Now with all these tips, you will bet a 420% better caver and
everyone will know it.
Warning: These tips will more than likely just cause you pain and misery and not work.
Andrew knows you don't need gloves. Peter disapproves
