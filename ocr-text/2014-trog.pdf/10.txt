INTRODUCTION
Welcome to the VPI Cave Club!! We will show you a place where the internet can never hurt you. Or at
least that's what our WUVT ad says this year. But really, we're a pretty awesome group of people. We
welcome any and all who want to hang out with us (as long as they are appropriately weird). And of
course we never haze anyone (membership tests don't count right? And those gypsum flowers are so
damn pretty).
Here's to another year of awesome adventures from California to Thailand and places in between.
We've gained some pretty great members and trainees and will bid goodbye to a few. But of course you
never really leave the Cave Club. No other club welcomes back those who have left Blacksburg with such
enthusiasm. Events like Picnic allow us to all gather together to listen to old stories and make some new
ones. Let's continue to be the best club at Tech and the most awesome NSS grotto.
