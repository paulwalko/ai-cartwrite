We got to the turn off and started heading
up dip. We finally got to our survey and we finished
a loop in some of the sketches breakdown and
flakey rock ceiling that I have been in. We then
headed back down stream and killed off at least 2
or 3 leads, found a potential dig with animal activi-
ty which we dug on for a bit, and then finally
headed back out of the cave. On this trip we sur-
veyed around 100 feet of passage on a 9 hour trip. But the fun wasn't over. We had forgotten
about Anthony Creek and the temperatures outside had dropped to an uncomfortable 24 de-
grees. Rebecca was not at all amused by this as Greg smirked and said, "Stop your whining. It
was 12 degrees outside last month when I did this." Greg suffers from a caving condition called
PTAD (Post-Trip Amnesia Disorder). So we all move through the hypothermic water as quickly as
possible, run to the cars, and then start the hours long warming back up process. I remember
that entire week I still got cold chills in class from being that cold for that amount of time. And
worst of all, Rebecca, Joe and I all caught PTAD because this was not our last trip to Dry Cave.
I have thus far then returned to Dry Cave now for a total of 4 trips, 35.5 hours, and
1252.08 Ft of surveyed passage. My second trip to Dry Cave (2 months later in April) consisted
of me, Vanessa Krabacher, and Joe Calderone. It was the same tedious entrance series crawl
followed by the endless 1 mile march to dig we had left where we saw the animal tracks and
scat. We dug for several hours and
broke into the upper potential lead on-
ly to be stumped by stone on stone
and no way to keep digging. This was
also a 6.5 hour trip, but luckily we had
rigged the upper hill and belayed
down to the cave instead of crossing
Anthony Creek. It was still a little bit
chilly outside.
