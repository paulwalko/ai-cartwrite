It was defiantly more of a bitch getting back up though. And so, we all climbed down
and BOOM! There are just millions of formations everywhere, most sparkling white and pristine.
We carefully make our way to several of our leads and kill them off quickly. Sarah and Mae then
began to get cold, and so we decided to exit the cave yet again for about a 7 hour trip. The
float trip was quite delightful back to the cars as well.
And thus comes my most recent, and most rewarding, trip into Dry yet! My 4th trip, in July
of 2013 consisted of me, Greg Springer, and Rebecca Stewart. Matt Skowronski, Joe Calderone,
and Tommy Polson were another crew, who was going to be pushing the "Bitter End" at the very
back of the breakdown stream in the cave. So again, we cross Anthony Creek, climb, crawl,
stoop walk for 1 mile, climb, duck under, climb, blow hole, and finally we are back to the beauti-
ful upper end of Dry. Rebecca, Greg and I, get to our first upper level lead after about another
hour or so of caving and again BOOM! We find literally 1152.2 feet of surveyed passage. Sadly
one single set of foot prints from a lone scooper was already in the passage so it was not virgin
cave. However it was giant booming borehole with a very high ceiling, and completely flat
floors! Our longest shot as about 93 feet (Distos are fun). We finish up and then head out of the
cave for a good 13 hour trip. We were very satisfied and happy with our selves. The other crew
had also found some passage but it was nasty, high canyon, crumbly wall passage. They also still
have not found a way around "The Bitter End".
And so that is where I leave my story of Dry Cave for now. The cave is at a current length
of 4.69 miles long and a depth of 205 feet deep. I defiantly plan on returning to the cave in the
near future and continue the hunt for more leads near the back of the cave. The air flow is
good, and that water has to come from somewhere! Thank you Greg Springer for the line plot.
