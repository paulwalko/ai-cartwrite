Notes before I start: Two weeks ago, there was too much water going into the entrance of Clover Hollow. One
week ago, we got 20 inches of snow.
The 9 of us divided into Dave C's and JoeZo's vehicles, then headed towards the batranch and on to
Clover Hollow. We got to the cave and after playing with the horses for a little, we got geared up. This took a
good while because we had four people on the trip who had only been vertically trained at the platform, had no
gear, and were about to depart on their first vertical trip. Webbing harnesses had to be made, figure-8s given
out, and knot sets tied. Tommy and Andrew proceeded to rig the pit. Because of the amount of people we had,
they rigged two ropes. To our dismay, there was a heavy waterfall running into the pit, a bigger one than two
weeks previous. The rigging took a while because they were trying to keep the rope out of the waterfall. By this
time, I'd say it was around noon. Joe and Andrew volunteered to go down the ropes first to start rigging the
next drop. Tommy and I were going to go second to provide belays to the newbies. Joe got to the bottom of his
rope and was standing in the waterfall, Andrew was getting sprayed. They both came back up to tell us that they
didn't think it was going to pan out. Having so many new people rappel and doing so in the water would probably
lead to hypothermia later on. The trip was aborted.
Our original backup plan was to go to the quarry near the bat-ranch but Dave mentioned going to Bar-
ney's Wall and doing vertical work there
|(more adventurous). The majority agreed
with him so we set off up towards Mountain
Lake to get there. Joe was driving his Ford
van and Dave was in his Toyota FJ Cruiser.
Dave clearly wasn't going to have any trouble
on the gravel, snowy, narrow, steep, muddy
road. Joe did however, and I'm glad I was in
| his van for the exciting ride. We were slip-
ping everywhere on the snowy road for most
of the 2-3 miles we drove.
