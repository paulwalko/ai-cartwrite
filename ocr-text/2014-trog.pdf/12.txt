PICNIC
We didn't let the absolutely awful freezing our
asses off weather get us down! (OK maybe
some of us did a little bit). Regardless of the
blistering cold, we had a great picnic. And, yes
know, you old farts out there have plenty of
stories from picnics with several inches of snow
on the ground. This year's highlights included a
go cart built by Steve Wells himself that carried
many more little boys than originally intended.
Some of the little boys may have been drunk.
