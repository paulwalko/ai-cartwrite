With that room mapped, we moved on, down another tight section to a larger room
(near the far left of the map). This opened up to multiple paths, forward, and an-
other path that Amy and Peter had found lead back to previously explored section of
the cave. With this mapped, it was time for a quick break. Here Amy left us, and the
group decided to do a couple more stations before calling it quits.
Back in the room of many paths, and after some slight discussion we decided to go
for the longest measurement of the day, more than 25 ft. Even after Peter and Jen-
nifer had walked to the end of the path, it wasn't until Nick went down the path was
it discovered that there was another offshoot off this mail run. The Tong path was
sketched in, but the station was not completely registered. We then shortened our
measure to the entrance of this new path, and took this 2 ft wide passage up roughly
15 ft.
The stream of small talk continued while the sketchers did their work, and after 4+
hours underground, it was decided to call it quits for this first cave re survey. It
was spectacular how quick the walk/crawl back was. Amy met us at the entrance, and
we headed back to Blacksburg. After being logged into a computer by Nick, we had
surveyed over 400 ft, and my first survey trip now has a map that I can point to and
say I helped with that.
