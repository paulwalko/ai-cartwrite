TAG
Those of us who went to TAG this year
partied hard enough to make up for all of
you slackers who didn't want to make the
drive. With spectacular weather, three of
us represented VPI in the 4th annual
Monkey Butt Run with Sarah finishing as
2nd overall female. Respectable Sarah,
but weren't you first last year?
Then we enjoyed the weather some more
(did I mention how nice it was?) rappel-
ling Weaver's Point, despite the park be-
ing closed due to the government shut-
down. The older and wiser (Ray) just en-
joyed the view and a few beers.
Thanks to an appearance by
our good friends from Califor-
nia, we enjoyed rum spiced ap-
ple cider on Saturday night,
heavy on the rum. Many of us
enjoyed a whole lot of drunk
shopping. The vendors went
home happy.
Sunday morning came with the
usual headache and tears as we
had to return to reality and
make that long drive back.
Nothing that a good Qdoba
hangover burrito couldn't
solve.
