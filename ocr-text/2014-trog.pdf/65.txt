The fire warming me down to my bones. I felt toughly roasted and was hungry to see what else the Bat Ranch
had to offer. I coerced my side kick to follow me to a field so we could go star gazing. He early followed me, but
didn't pick up on the subtle innuendo that I wanted to get him alone. He invited the rest of our crew to join us.
Oyo Vey, I guess no alone time after all. A few puppies followed us as we strolled to the flat field on the other
side of the house. Their red lights illuminating the path as we walked. Once we were all the way into the middle
of the field I weaved my arms around myself, arched my back, and stared straight into the abyss above me.
There wasn't a cloud in the sky; every star was beautiful and distinct. I felt impossibly small compared to all the
space in front of me. I wanted to lay on the ground to really soak in the nature, but my city friends couldn't fath-
om the idea. They were convinced I would get bugs on me... What a bunch of pansies.
It was almost one when the growls in my belly became too overwhelming to bear. I needed food, NOW. I bid
adue to all the new friends I had made, and commanded my caravan to climb into the car. I knew I had food at
home, but the people of the car had spoken, Taco bell was the next stop. I ordered a party pack for the crew, and
got humped from behind while I spoke. I prayed that I could get these tacos soon, for two reasons, one: I was
really hungry, two: I needed to get these crazed friends out of here; they were on a humping spree. I knew It was
because they were enjoying how flustered I was getting by their ridiculousness. I knew the best way to get them
to stop would be to pay no attention to them. BUT that was impossible. Put yourself in my shoes. You're the only
sober person in taco bell. 4 drunken friends of yours are dry humping inanimate objects and one of them is pel-
vic thrusting into your hip. Now you can understand how badly I needed to get those tacos. The person behind
the counter calls my order number and hands over the food, which is packaged in the shape of a boom box. One
of the boys throws it over his shoulder and starts making a beat. The rest of the fools start singing and dancing. I
would take this over the humping any day. I am the last in line as we shuffle out of taco bell to the parking lot. By
the time I cross the threshold into the outside air, three of the boys are dancing to the imaginary music in front
of a car full of girls at the window for the drive through. This dance recital doesn't last too long. Eventually the
boys are satisfied with the
applause and laughter from
the girls in the car.
The bat ranch is a wild
place, where cavers are free
to be cavers. I highly recom-
mend every trainee attend
one of these spectacles. If|
anyone is hesitant about
going, then do what I did,
bring an entourage.
