I feel better when I am going down, and I like going down fast. I like to feel the wind in my face from my
downward descent. Rappelling in a cave like Golandrinas is interesting because the air is perfectly still. You
can judge your speed by the wind on your face and the pressure popping your ears. Hanging off the side of
El Cap, it's nice to stop to take in one of the best views in the world while participating in almost the only
sport that allows it. A rock climber's view would be close to this, but not so quickly changing. Climbing the
big wall seems insane, but it is rock climbers who think we are the crazy ones! At the bottom, on belay for
hours, many rock climbers pass by to chat and try to figure out what we are doing. “Jugging all the way to
the top? That's something else!"
On long rappels, the rope must go between one's legs, not over the side of the hip as is possible on short-
er drops (under 400 ft). The weight of the rope makes it feel stiff and hard like a metal cable. It is just not
possible over the hip, there is too much contact with the body and it is uncomfortable. Some people use
only the break bars on the rack to control speed, whereas others split the friction between the bars and
their gloved hand. At heights above 800 ft nudging the rope out with one's boot has a noticeable impact
on speed. Not only because of the increased friction, but also because of the change of rope contact angle
on the bottom bar. On a descent I will control speed mainly by the bars, but also by squeezing the rope,
pulling down on the rope, and also pulling the rope up into a J over my rack to stop at the bottom. Pulling
down on the rope increases tension applied to the bars the same way that added rope weight does. I rec-
ommend (new-ish) heavy reinforced Petzl or PMI rappel gloves for long rappels. The fingers always tend to
get thin first. The heat transferred through the gloves can be intense, depending on speed, which requires
slowly repositioning areas of contact. Or one could rely on the rack more, or slow things down. There are
many variations to play with, which is one reason why rappelling is so much fun. Operating a rack in a
sense can feel like driving a sports car.
After our first rap, and putting in our time to belay and act as bottom side support for our team, we hiked
up the back side of El Cap for our second rappel. The hike from the Yosemite Creek camp to the summit
and edge top camp of El Cap was one of the highlights of the trip. The hike includes twelve miles of fantas-
tically changing climates and altitudes. We crossed landscapes as varied as barren tortured rocks, lush
temperate forests of giant prehistoric ponderosas, sandy beaches along a river, grassy meadows, and fi-
nally wind whipped searing granite desert. Dizzying heights and hundreds of feet of waterfalls even the
hike out. After another night at Top Camp, derigging, and packing up the entire camp into large duffle bags
began. Everything that went up, had to come back down,
attached to rappellers. We each made it down the 2650 ft one
last time, with 50 – 100 lbs of gear attached to our D-rings. The
added weigh required a bit more care, more bars depending on
bottom belay, and slower times. After we were all on the
bottom, minus a few who would hike out, the main line was
lowered on paracord. We were able to use mules to haul all of
the rope to the top previously. The mountains of rope were
quickly paid out and stuffed into three large bags. With team-
work, the derig process was surprisingly quick, but also it made
the derig of any other drop or cave look very easy.
