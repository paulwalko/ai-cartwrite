LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT
Hello and welcome to the VPI Cave Club's... Trog?! And what a year it has been! We have had many
awesome events like Easter Beer, Picnic, Float Trip, Halloween, and Banquet. The Club has also
brought back Young Timers Reunion as well as making an appearance at Fall VAR by hosting it. I
would like to thank everyone for helping with such a successful event. We have had a few new mem-
bers to the club who have been great assets with training new members. We also have currently 20
prospective members working really hard on their membership! The caving has been just awesome!
We hold to our reputation of being one of the most active cave clubs around by going caving every
weekend of the semesters. We have also been caving all over: Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Ten-
nessee, Mexico, and probably some other locations I do not know of. Sorry John, but no Antarctica or
Africa this year J. Thanks again to everyone who has made this year such a great one! Lastly, keep on
scooping that booty, dropping those pits, and caving that borehole!
-Nick “Peppy” Socky
