12:07pm- All useless persons hang out on the island. Attempts to free the empty float are deemed fu-
tile. A line of people forms to transfer the coolers and Corgi off of the float and onto the island.
1:13pm- A group of us leaves to assess the parking situation. Although none of us had cars, we took
Peppy's keys. We determine that the cars can be moved to the river bank near the island.
1:38pm- We arrive back to the group with Peppy's car. Other drivers volunteer to go retrieve their
cars with us.
1:45pm- We attempt to drive back to the drop off point to bring more cars to the group. A chain
fence has been locked between us and the other cars. There is much debate over breaking down the
fence or driving onto the railroad tracks.
2:02pm- We return to the group and explain the situation. More drinking and grilling lightens the
mood.
2:19pm-We head back to the fence and skillfully remove the bolts to get through. Ray retrieves his
truck and leads the way to the group.
