All through the trip I'd heard how beautiful Spring Hollow is; but I didn't see much to
back it up going in. Sure, it was nice in a cave-y kind of way, but I'd seen similar. On
the way back though, Bill lead us up on top of the break-down, rather than back
through. And the corridor he led us into was amazing. There was a flowstone pool
larger than a king-size bed across the floor; it was glowing white and practically un-
touched. Past it was a very tall, wide hallway with formations literally everywhere.
Untouched stalagmites and stalactites covered the floor and ceiling; beautiful for-
mations and shields composed the entirety of the walls. It continued on like that for a
hundred feet before it curved out of sight; Bill said that when he had surveyed the
cave before it continued just like that for several hundred more. It's likely that no-
body had gone that far since the initial survey; everything looked so pristine. We did-
n't go into it very far ourselves; I was very scared I was going to slip and destroy
something beautiful.
There's not much to say about the rest of the trip. We retraced our steps, and
Bill made some drawings while Joe took measurements. The entrance wasn't signifi-
cantly harder to climb on the way out than it was on the way in. We didn't even
freeze to death getting to the car; Peppy didn't even have to take my pants off for
me, unlike our last excursion. Overall, Spring Hollow is the single prettiest cave I've
ever been to, and I'd love the opportunity to explore more of it again sometime.
