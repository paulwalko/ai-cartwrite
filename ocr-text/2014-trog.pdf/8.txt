LETTER FROM THE EDITOR
It's my last year as editor and I want to thank everyone for the insane number of articles sub-
mitted this year. It sure makes me feel better to be able to hand out a nice fat Trog. I think a lot
of this is attributed to the number of new members we have! Although I like to think that peo-
ple actually enjoy writing articles and it's not JUST to get it signed off. I have to say one of my
absolute least favorite parts of doing the Trog is the letter from the editor. I really never know
what I am supposed to say here. I am so thankful that there is not a letter from the vice presi-
dent as well. In fact I really don't enjoy writing that much in general. I'm more of a math person.
Why did I take this job again? Oh yea the pictures. I love taking and putting together all the pic-
tures. So I hope that everyone enjoys all of the awesome pictures i've compiled to remember
the year by! I sure put a lot more effort into that than I do writing the letter from the editor. But
hey no one reads this stupid thing anyway right? I mean I wouldn't.
