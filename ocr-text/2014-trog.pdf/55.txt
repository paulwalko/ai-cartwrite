Unwinding
For a week after Yosemite, we were able to stay with VPI alumni John Bowling and Julie Booker. In addi-
tion to seeing all of Yosemite Valley and Hetch Hetchy, the five of us were able to squeeze even more na-
tional parks into the week: Kings Canyon, Sequoia, and Pinnacles National Parks. In Pinnacles, we visited
Bear Gultch Talus Cave, which is a large bat hibernaculum. It's always fun to visit with cavers in different
grottos, so we were able to make it to a grotto meeting and party with the San Joaquin Valley Grotto near
Fresno, CA. The meeting was at a local caver's ranch which had defunct exploratory gold mines on the
property, which we were able to explore. I thought of my El Cap adventure as a once in a lifetime kind of
event, but now it seems like just the kind of trip I might like to make every three years - which is exactly
what VBATS does. Get trained up if you are interested!
