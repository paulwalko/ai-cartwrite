Study on Relationship Between Purchases of Stenlights and La-z-Boys
"Inconclusive"
In this new study from the Institute of Cave and Karst Research Founda-
tion Association, a strong correlation was detected in the purchase of
these two seemingly unconnected items. Unfortunately, the study was
deemed biased and inconclusive as no data points were obtained from

Bats Discover Key to Immunity from WNS: Pabst Blue Ribbon
Speculation abounds on how they figured it out, but our source points out the plentiful supply of littered cans in many local

in caches leading right up 219. "We're just going to end up standing in the stream with a com box for 10 hours," says cave res-
cue superstar Mr. Booker, “and I'm not doing that without a wetsuit. Or sober." "I'm going to carry in a large bulky pack which
everyone will think is full of serious rescue gear," said young cave rescue superstar Mr. Socky, "but really it's full of shoring
tools, so I can recreate the Devil's Pinch while everyone's off searching."
Graffiti in New River Cave Beautifully Maintained
The myriad kaleidoscopic rainbow of directionally challenged arrows, nicknames, and lewd slogans and drawings which deco-
rate New River Cave from the entrance to the waterfall are being meticulously flagged off for protection. And the ugly old car-
bide inscriptions of dates and names of the old explorers no one cares about anymore have finally been scrubbed off the wall
of the Supper Room. Seriously though, that last bit is real.
