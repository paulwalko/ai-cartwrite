With the end of the war and gas rationing, more personal vehicles available, and better techniques, there are reports in the
newsletters of smaller trips (often only 3 or 4 people), which presumably also became more frequent. Bill Cuddington (for
whom "Bill's Rappel” in Newberry Cave is named – likely on a 1953 trip) was an SRT pioneer. The VPI Cave Club was at the
forefront of new caving techniques during the 1950s, although there is a period during the mid-50s where there is little written
record. There are no minutes of the meetings nor newsletters during this time; only the Treasurer's records exist today. But
those records confirm the club's continued activity during this period by the record of dues payments and expenditures for
such things as carbide, hard hats and rope.
A written record appears again in 1955, with a revised constitution, and in 1958 with the fatality of a club member in Catawba
Murder Hole. The 1955 constitution does not contain any bylaws, and no mention is made of membership requirements
(other than being a VPI student), nor of any training program. From the details of a 1958 accident report (chemical degrada-
tion of a manila rope resulting in a complete failure during a rappel) we can infer that SRT had become common/standard prac-
tice by that time.
The decade of the 1960s was a period of huge changes and upheavals in nearly every aspect of life, with little being the same at
the end of this decade as it was at the beginning; and most of those changes did not come easily or without turmoil. The Cave
Club certainly mirrored what was going on everywhere else.
After the lack of information from much of the 1950s, the history of membership requirements and the training program come
into clearer focus again with the revised constitution and bylaws adopted in 1961. For the first time there were competency
requirements for membership, with a new category for Prospective/Trainee membership. But regular members were divided
into Horizontal and Vertical 'Qualification Groups', with Horizontal Qualification necessary before becoming eligible for Verti-
cal. The Vertical Qualification requirements of 1961 and the membership requirements of today have more similarities than
differences.
But in other respects, the 1961 constitution and bylaws still reflected the top-down hierarchy of the early days of the club.
Article VIII of that Constitution concerns "Organization of Expeditions”, with the requirement that every trip be authorized by
the President by appointing an Expedition Commander, who has complete authority over the trip. Amendments create a sys-
tem of A and B Leaders, with only A Leaders having full discretion.
