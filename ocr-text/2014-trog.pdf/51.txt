An Interview with Thailand Celebrity
Matt Skowronski
By Courtney Trost
Q: What is the best part of Thailand?
A: Everyone there is so interesting. Thai people are super cool
and the travelers have been traveling.
Q: What is the worst part of Thailand?
A: For me, my job. In general, nothing is free. You have to pay
for water.
Q: What is Thailand beer like?
A: There are 5 beers. For are the equivalent of PBR but at 6%
alcohol. 1 is called Peerlau Dark which is almost a real beer.
Q: What is Thailand liquor like?
A: There is tons. Sangsong is the cheap liquor and you can also buy Johnny Walker blue label and black la-
bel at the 7-11. They have 7-11's everywhere.
Q: What are Thailand caves like?
A: They've got them. They're hot (62-65 degrees F). They're weirdly similar to Virginia caves except some are
monk retreats and have platforms for meditating. Also they have spiders as big as your open hand.
Q: Are there grottos?
A: No, there aren't really organized caving groups. People just go sometimes.
Q: Anything else that is interesting?
A: All of Thailand geographical data is online as is all data for cave entrances. Also Thai people think white
skin is really beautiful. They have a very traditional view of women's roles so if you are halfway decent to
women they throw themselves at you.
Q: So you've gotten laid a lot?
A: No.
Q: What is your biggest take away from the experience?
A: If you get the opportunity to love abroad, not just travel abroad, you should do it because it will kick your
ass but it's totally worth it.
