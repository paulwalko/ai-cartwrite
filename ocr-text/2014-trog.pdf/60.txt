Advertise
I'm not fucking around here. Advertising is important. If nobody shows up, you're boned financially. Contact the NSS and
ask them to advertise your event.
Revisit the budget
As if you hadn't been doing that every week for the past three months. Take a step back and ask for other opinions. Are
you on track to make money (again, never be on track to break even)? Make sure you're not forgetting anything. Can
you afford to buy that extra porta-john? If you think you'll have enough money to get beer or gas for volunteers or
the band, don't promise it, just give it at/after the event when you have the money for sure. It's better to receive
something you weren't expecting than to not get something you were promised.
The last two weeks or “Oh shit! The event is in two weeks!”
Make your last plea for volunteers and equipment. Go over the play-by-play to make sure things will go smoothly at your
event. Advertise some more and try not to check the weather obsessively.
Step 4: Set Up or “That farmer probably won't notice his tractor's missing for an hour."
Arrive a day before the event if you can, and remember that setup is effectively the start of the event. It's a good idea to have
reserve supplies on hand (first-aid kit, extra toilet paper, emergency bourbon). Maintain a good relationship with the land-
owners and your volunteers. Communicate what you want clearly and err on the side of too much communication rather than
too little. If at all possible, be the first one working and the last one to quit. Don't worry about those cows in the road, you
totally weren't the ones that let them out.
Step 5: The Event or "Is everything working? That can't be right..."
Once the event is underway your job is basically crisis management. Be able to send yourself or a runner to get things you
didn't think you needed, like hand sanitizer. When registration is closed, move your cashbox to a locked car. Don't ever leave
money sitting around. Sadly, event funds have gone missing this way in the past. Set up a lost and found. By the way, if any-
body is missing their GPS, send me a description!
Step 6: Aftercare or
“Done! *drops mic*"
TICKET BOOTH
Make sure you pay all the
people who need to be
paid. Make damn sure you
thank all the people you
need to thank (this includes
the people you just paid).
Don't forget any other re-
sponsibilities like giving
people address lists. Give
those who helped the most
a bottle of bourbon. Up-
date this article so that you
have something to go off
when your dumb ass de-
cides to do the same thing
next year.
