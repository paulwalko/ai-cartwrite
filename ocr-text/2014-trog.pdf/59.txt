Pick a location
Proximity to caves is the most important
thing here. If you have to drive three
hours to see some interesting caves,

you're not throwing a caving event,
Here
you're throwing a campout. Pick a
location which will fit the number of
people you expect. Contact that loca-
tion early to express interest. How do
they feel about large numbers of mud-
dy cavers? Are there showers? Do
they have any relationships with food
vendors? How do they feel about ex-
ternal (caving) vendors? Do they pro-
Che
vide toilets or porta-johns? Do they
provide event insurance? Do they
have a stage area for events? Is hav-
ing a bonfire a possibility? Is the location pet friendly? What's their relationship with the locals? This is not an ex-
haustive list, but you should think about these type of things.
Plan events
Do you plan to have led trips? If so, you should start making a list of caves and people you could ask to lead trips. When
will registration open and close each day? Do you plan on providing meals? How about entertainment? Will non-
cavers be in attendance? If so, make up a list of nearby attractions
or activities. Geocashing is a great option which is available almost

Set up registration
If you can find somebody web-savvy enough to set up an online registration system, you can greatly increase the number
of preregistrations you get. Old farts tend to demand snail-mail registration options, so be prepared to send those
out as well. Registration forms are a great way to advertise the event, so give a brief outline of the important and fun
parts of your event.
