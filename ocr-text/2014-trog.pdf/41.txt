My third Dry Cave Trip took place again later
that year only two months later, in June 2013. It con-
sisted of Mae Kile, Adam Byrd, Tommy Polson, Sarah
Crowder, and me. On my previous two trips to the
cave, we had killed all of the leads before the "Blow
Hole" and it was time to venture even deeper into
the cave. It is worth mentioning, just before the Blow
Hole is the "Blow Hole Gallery" which is a highly deco-
rated rim stone pool area. I have included pictures of
course in this saga. So it being June, and with me re-
membering Anthony Creek, I decided the brilliant
idea of bringing floats with us to the cave entrance
and then floating back down to the cars on a late
relaxing evening float trip after the cave. We stashed the floats near the entrance and began
our way again up the 1 mile upstream march again. Every bend in the stream passage and
even the air and water flow shaped formations were started to become recognizable. The thrill,
yet apathetic feeling of returning this cave again was beginning to get to real. We got to the
Blow hole in about 2 hours, and began our decent down it. It is a very tight narrow little hole
which blows frigid air at you constantly.
