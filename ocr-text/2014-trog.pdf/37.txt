It is in this paradise many a creature calls home. At the top of the food chain perhaps the first thought to
pop into a novices mind is bats. Coming in many species bats are often thought of as a dangerous vector
but this common misconception is far from deserved. While there are vampire bats not all bats are vis-
cous blood sucking disease infested migrants that Hollywood would have us believe. No these gentle
nocturnal prowlers are without a doubt the exterminators of the true vectors of many diseases, the mos-
quito. One bat can feed on thousands of insects each night from hunt utilizing echolocation. Some bats
aren't even insectivorous but rather herbivores searching for fruit. Some still are nectar feeders and thus
pollinators for flowers, chiropterophily, such as Agave. Most caves are also homes to crickets, spiders,
salamanders, millipedes, Amblyopsidae (cave fish), copepods, macroinvertabrates, cave swallows, and in
some cases even glow worms!
Not to worry if you are not a fan of the creepy crawlers not all caves are teaming with biota.
Caves can be an art not just from the geologic crystalline structures but also from honing of underground
streams. Many a cave will have varying degrees of texture and composition. So behold an artist's land-
scape below the surface where only a select few dare venture. Painter, potter, sculpture, or drawer there
is something for everyone. Inspiration abound...away we go to explore!
For many a caver half the excitement is getting underground and exploring a new place. Often-
times the search for that overlooked passageway that leads to a new discovery. If just to push a little fur-
ther a discovery awaits at times running on pure adrenaline. Ah the prospects of being the first to find
passage to link two caves, a better route, or even a undiscovered cave. Perhaps even the chance to have
your name in the annals of history forever remembered as the one who discovered what was thought not
to exist.
Recorded in the surveys used by the multitude of the caving community such adventures stand
resolute. Compass, tape, clinometer, sketch book, ruler, marker...let's go and record a adventure. Not
only will this guide be recorded but many a caver will be prevented from losing his/her way. A point is
marked, compass and incline taken tape pulled to the next set station. Subsequent stations set and read
from one another as the lead tape yells "on station" to the instrument reader while the sketcher etches a
detailed schematic layout of what seems an endless void in the dark.
It is in these moments of silence one can come closest to inner peace. Sit down, turn off your
lights, and listen. Other than the rush of a stream or the trickle of water what do you hear? Nothing!
Few places on earth grant such luxury of total silence.
