WHY CAVE?
by Eric Combs
From the time one is known as a
caver people ask why do you cave? The
inquirer expects a simple reply but the
reasoning is anything but. Since the
beginning of Quaternary Period man-
kind has been drawn to caves for shelter, survival, their mystic wonder and more.
Caves have long played the role of shelter for the early neanderthals to the present day FARC of
Columbia. Throughout history caves provided not only shelter but a means to a way of life. The Aztec
rituals in cenotes, Puebloan dwelling in the cliffs of New Mexico, refugees in caves of Vietnam, Holocaust
survivors of the gypsum caves of the Ukraine, Himalayans in caves of Nepal and the list goes on. Cul-
tures across the globe have relied on caves for their very survival and many still do so today. Beyond a
means of historical significance in shelter, rituals, and survival caves may be more so known as a natural
resource.
Many of the early mines were caves for resources such as limestone, gypsum, granite, guano,
crystal mines like that of Niaca and so forth. Some of the darkest times in history led to scarcity of natu-
ral resources where gun powder was needed. Salt peter was one of the ingredients sought after to make
gunpowder. Caves such as Mammoth, Kingston, Green Sulphur Salt Peter, Haynes, and even Tawynes
show evidence of salt peter mining. Many a cave will present a interesting formation or gem for the vigi-
lant eye.
Whether it be the gypsum clusters in Clover Hollow, the moon pools of rimstone in Starnes, an-
thracite of Cox Ridge, or hydromagnesite balloons of Lechuguilla every cave has its geologic wanders for
the eager eye. Even the well traversed caves have their calcium carbonate spires of flowstone, stalag-
mites rising from the floor, stalagtites piercing from the ceiling, columns from the joining of stalagmites
and stalagtites. Often forming a choke of challenging yet mesmerizing cave mazes. Nothing quite like
hundreds of thousands of years in nature's lab to the delight of a geologist or chemist. Here the wonders
of nature and the life giving element water come together to form a paradise.
