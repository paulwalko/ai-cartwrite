How the Cave Club Training Program Evolved
It Was Not All Walking Passage
Richard Cobb - VPI 215, VP 1979-80
The Cave Club Training Program and membership requirements of today have been in place, with minor changes, for a long time
- but they did not start out that way. The Club was born in 1942 with a handful of members. In January, 1944, the first news-
letter issue (then named the Grotto Grapevine) proudly proclaimed that it had been “published since 1944”, with the letterhead
stating it was “The Last Frontier for the Pioneer”. VPI was then predominantly military (ROTC), and the second world war was
ongoing. Gas rationing was in effect, and personal vehicles were much less common.
In those early days the Club was very much a top-down hierarchical organization. Cave trips were planned for the entire aca-
demic quarter, with a single trip each weekend, in which the entire club participated. Transportation to the cave was often in
trucks - a few early photos show as many as 15 to 20 members, many already wearing their hard hats and carbide lamps, load-
ed into the open bed of a single truck. Each trip was organized by an 'Expedition Commander' who planned all aspects of the
trip ahead of time.
An early training document (1950-51) was titled Suggestions for Expedition Commanders, complete with organization diagrams.
An 'expedition' was usually broken up into 'parties', such as a Survey Party, a Photography Party, etc. Each Party had an ap-
pointed Leader, and the Expedition might have other appointments, such as a Deputy Expedition Commander, a Rigging Officer,
and perhaps a Camp Officer, among others. To give you an idea of just how seriously this was taken is a statement near the
beginning of this document: “The VPI Grotto does not tolerate disobedience to the expedition commander or his appointed rep-
resentatives. It is the duty of the expedition commander to report to the Grotto all cases of disobedience so that those guilty
may be expelled from the Grotto."
Given the military mind-set of the students of those days, the need for large scale organization for transportation, and the rudi-
mentary techniques of the time, this probably all made a lot of sense. Almost any VPI student could become a member just by
paying dues; there was no training program or requirements as we now know them. Vertical work was still in it's infancy, and
even simple entrance drops would require much rigging and a crew of people to lower and haul individuals in a bosun's chair. A
trip that could be accomplished today in a couple of hours using Single Rope Techniques (SRT) may have taken a whole day, or
even a weekend, and required many people to carry out.
