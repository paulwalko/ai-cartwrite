Below is the sample excel spread sheet from sheet 2 in the same excel document. Sheet 1 holds all of the other data
discussed above. The first example image is a set of data for the monthly caving tracker. It tracks how long you were under-
ground during that month, and how many trips you went on during that month too. Setting up the plots is the most complicat-
ed part so if

ly the same
way you do on
the first sheet. For calculating the hours and trips per month, I would recommend updating, or adding, the hours of a trip to
that month directly after your cave trip as well as adding a trip to that month. The example is the detailed cave information.
Generating the plot is very similar to generating the monthly caving plot as well. There is more math involved with this set
though, but only if you wish to do it. For calculating the totals again, just do a summation of the preceding column of data
above. To calculate the %hours, click cell E23 and in the fx bar type in: =C23/$C$28*100. This will then calculate the percent-
age of hours spent in Tawneys to the overall hours spent caving. The same thing can be done similarly for the trips

(F23=D23/$D$28*100). This can then be done for every single cave as well, by clicking on E23 (or F23) then moving the cur-
sor to the bottom right corner of the cell until the cross arrow changes to a diagonal arrow, left click and drag down to row 27.
The $C$28 uses the $ symbol to keep that part of the equation exactly the same. So that's about it! You can of course add your
data manipulation like trends, or if you are project caving, how many feet you survey along with bat and hour counts. My cur-
rent spreadsheet as of March 31, 2014, and starting in September 2010, is 118 rows long, with 106 cave trips, 511 hours, 198
seen bats since December 19th, 2013, with a total of 41 different caves I have been to. I plan on to continue updating this after
college and also find other various ways to play with my cave data. I hope this helps to inspire you in your caver nerd side! It's
always just a good idea to document caving activities too.
