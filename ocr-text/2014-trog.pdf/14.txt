Float Trip 2013: The Best Float Trip Ever?
By Courtney Trost
Float Trip 2013 will be one that is talked about for quite
some time. Pretty much what could go wrong did go
wrong. A recap of the events for those of you who un-
fortunately missed out or else blocked the entire day
from your memory (all times are approximate):
9:00am-Feeble attempts to start to build the float and
to rally a crowd to help.
9:00-11:00am- Build float, many (mostly us females)
bitch about the freezing cold water. Also much atten-
tion is given to the extremely cute Corgi.
11:12am-Set sail! Once again, against all odds, the float
seems to be in one piece above the water. At least for
the time being....
11:29am- Potential threat spotted as we drift towards a
group of trees.
11:36am- Threat confirmed. Float wedges into the trees.
Rushing water forces the float against the branches and the barely drunk crowd shifts to the other
side of the float.
11:42am- Many attempts to push the float out. Mike Newsome falls off and enjoys a swim down
the river. Excitement and cursing pursues.
11:47am- A plan is formed to move the crowd
off the float and free the float without the peo-
ple weight.
11:58am-Strong swimmers rig a line from the
float to the nearby island. One by one we exit
the float, following the line so that the current
doesn't take anyone. A group of select individu-
als (I'm not sure if they were selected for
strength or stupidity) stay behind to push the
float away from the trees once it is empty.
