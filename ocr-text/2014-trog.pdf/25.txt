Banquet 2014 A.1. Cartwright
The VPI Cave Club Awards Ban-
quet was held on February 15th at
the New Life Center. This is the old
Red Cross building. Some remem-
ber it as Buddy's and Daddy's Mon-
ey. The Old Farts knew it as Kens.
While it wasn't snowing, the previ-
ous 18 inches and the cold made
getting around sporting. The week-
end kicked off with a Friday pre-
Banquet party at Carol and Joe Zo-
kaites. Early arrivals had to shovel snow to make room for new arrivals. The Zo's made sure
that no one went hungry or thirsty and we are all very grateful. Mike Frame mushed all the
way from Alaska.
Several cocktail parties around town loosened folks up for the main soiree at the New Life
Center. Dan”Joker”Crowder and Ellen Koertge expertly arranged a wonderful Banquet with
Treasurer Brian McCarter pinching the pennies. A large can of adult beverage was provided,
and then we enjoyed a delicious catered dinner. For once, there was plenty of food.
After dinner, we listened to Guest Speaker Chris Nicola and his fascinating tale of Ukraini-
an Jews hiding in caves from the Nazi's. Chris later gave a detailed account at the Hillel Cen-
|ter. Thanks go to Joey
Fagan and his sponsor-
ship of Chris.
President Nick Socky
and Joker mc'd the
awards portion of the
night. The Guano Clus-
ters for service over the
last year were beautiful
clay and glaze shot
glasses made by expert
potter, Deborah Barnes.
Thank you, Deborah
