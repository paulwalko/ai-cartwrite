John George and Katrina should win a dis-
gustingly cute couple award for both being
voted in as members at Picnic in consecu-
tive years. Unfortunately for Katrina, I
think JG had a few more girls surrounding
him than Katrina had guys. However, the
men managed to get Katrina more than a
few inches off the ground. Katrina was ad-
equately harassed by the crowd, although
she still could not tell us why her boyfriend
is so damn pasty.
