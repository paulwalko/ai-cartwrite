After much discomfort and many creative combina-
tions of obscenities, the crawl opened into a little room
which slanted downward, the ceiling and floor progres-
sively getting closer to each other until the only space
left was a tiny hole that was blowing air. Unfortunately
none of us were mutants, so we were unable to Hulk
Smash our way through. All we had with us was a
shovel, so shovel we did. You'll need a way to pass
the time during the dig since only one person at a time
can get close to the pinch and still be able to move.
One way to do this is to rewrite lyrics of Disney songs
to make them caving oriented (see page 48] although
there's really no need to rewrite Heigh Ho from Snow White. Allow the slightly crazed laughter that results from inhaling excessive
amounts of dirt to run rampant. This is important because, as everyone knows, if you hold in The Sillies for too long, brain goo will
drip out of your ears. A few hours later you'll find that the pinch is a little bigger, but still requires the prowess of hammers and crow-
bars, so turn yourself around and drag yourself back through the Canyon of Doom (which is now on an uphill slope), exit the cave,
walk into the nighttime where it's snowing sideways, and trek back to the car.
Wake up the next morning and realize how battered you are and appreciate how artistically the passage tie-dyed your body with
curious little bruises. Perhaps take a moment to imagine an alternate universe where you don't bruise ridiculously easily.
When you arrive back at the pinch the next day to continue the dig, be careful. Swinging hammers around in confined spaces is
dangerous, and produces an uprising of silt that is impressive. You can close your eyes but you can't close your nose, so the com-
bination of digging through fine, dry dirt and blowing wind (that only increased the more we dug) resulted in the most monumental
cave boogers I've ever experienced. If you would like to have this same experience, I expect that setting up a line of dust and snort-
ing it through a straw would produce a similar effect.
Eventually, the pinch broke open and led us to... a ton of passage! More than four hundred feet, it turned out. After digging and
surveying and completely wiping ourselves out (perhaps you, dear reader, have done this as well) we heaved our weary bodies
back to the entrance, completely exhausted. If you happen to do this to yourself, there is a possibility that you will be so tired after
your trip that when you drop a glove you'll just stand there staring at it, thinking about how you could just leave it until you concede
to yourself that you really ought to get it back. Take a minute to mentally prepare yourself for the effort it will take to reach down and
pick it up. You are permitted to groan like someone with hip dysplasia trying to sit down.
Now go back to the cabin and regale everyone there with all of your exciting stories and pretend that you can, in fact, feel your legs
and that your muscles are definitely not made of jelly.
