Cave On
By Nick Socky
Parody of Frozen’s: Let it Go, as performed by Idina Menzel.
My light glows dim in the dark today,
Not a foot print to be seen
A passage of isolation
And it's not even very clean
The waters moving from that in-feeder at the side
Couldn't cave it all, heaven knows I tried
Don’t go down there, why can't you see
The only one who can fit is me
Front-sights, back-sights, don't scoop it all
Survey that wall
Cave on, Cave on
Can't dig it out any more
Cave on, Cave on
Tomorrow I will be sore
I don't care if I miss sign out
Let this cave go on
The dark never bothered me anyway
It's funny how a giant borehole,
Makes the surface world seem small
And the canyons that once alarmed me
Don't frighten me at all
It's time to see what I can do
To push my limits and break through
I push, I crawl, too tight for me?
Nope, I'm free
Cave on, Cave on
I am one with the mud and stone
Cave on, Cave on
But I will never cave alone
Here I crawl
And Here I'll stay
Let this cave go on
The calcite sparkles from the wall into the ground
The cave is spiraling into mazing passage all around
The giant water fall is like a chilly blast
I'm never climbing out,
I want this cave to last
Cave on, Cave on
I'll cave until the break of dawn
Cave on, Cave on
My sketch is nearly drawn
Here I crawl
Through the mud and clay
Let this cave go on
The dark never bothered me anyway.
