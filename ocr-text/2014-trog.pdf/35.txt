We got to one point and had to stop because Dave had
stopped because the road was going uphill and was very
snowy. Due the stop. Joe wasn't able to get his speed up to
climb and got stuck. All of the trainees attempted to put
chains on his van for him and they seemed to be correct
until he started driving and they came apart and wrapped
around his axel. He got to a good parking area and then we
all walked the rest of the way to the parking area for Bar-
ney's Wall while Dave drove it.
It was around 3:30 when we got to the trailhead so we decided that we wouldn't have enough time to rig
and send at least 7 people down the rope and possibly back up. Especially because they were on knots. We walked
the 4 mile hike and arrived at the view. It was an incredible view and we had a perfect day to see it. We spent
some time talking to the others at the view and just chit chatting. After we got back to the car, Dave wanted to
go up the road a little more and see the fire tower. All 9 of us
then preceded to do a little circus trick and pile into his car for
a very sporting and exciting ride. While sitting in the back with
Tommy and on top of gear, trying to not fall out the back win-
dow, lose gear, or hit my head, we made it to the tower. Some
decided to climb the old tower while others of us exploring the
various buildings ridden with graffiti and bullet holes. The top of
Butt Mountain had an incredible view of Pembroke and Pearis-
burg. After exploring a room that had opened underneath some
of the rocks we all headed back down the mountain to split in our vehicles. Joe was able to make it out perfectly
with his impeccable driving skills. I was impressed. We stopped at the overlook on Mountain Lake Rd but were
about 5 mins too late and missed the sunset. We proceeded to Sign-out (which we had cancelled about 5 hours
earlier but we still had gear). We all decided to go get Thai
food but the place was packed. This followed with our theme
of the day: Plan A failing. Then we went for Mexican. Line
was out the door. Again, theme of the day: Plan B failing. We
tried once more for Lefty's and it was packed on Saturday
night in Blacksburg. “Stupid University”, to quote Dave C.
We decided it was pointless to get food and just went home.
Although we never got underground, it was a very adven-
turous day.
