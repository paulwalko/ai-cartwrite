THE CARRICK BEND IS AWESOME
Nikolaus Wittenstein
Give me your square-knot tyers, your poor, your
huddled masses yearning to breathe free. Let
them see the majesty that is the Carrick bend.
Let us begin with a discussion of everything that is
wrong with the square knot, also known as the
reef knot. When it's not capsizing into a deadly slip
knot, it's jamming. It does hold when both tails are
backed off-but a pair of overhand back-offs already make a perfectly good fisherman's
knot without the square knot at all. Mistakes in fying the square knot are so common that
its incorrect counterparts are even given names: the granny knot, the thief knot, the what
knot. Mr. Ashley, writer of the eponymous knot book, writes that "There have probably
been more lives lost as a result of using a Square Knot as a bend ... than from the failure
of any other half dozen knots combined." (pg. 258, #1402). He goes on to say that "In
fact, it is the ease with which the knot may be spilled that gives its value as a Reef Knot."
In other words, people use the square knot specifically when they need something that
turns into a slip knot at the slightest provocation.
One out of four of these is a square knot.
Four out of four of these can slip and kill you.
