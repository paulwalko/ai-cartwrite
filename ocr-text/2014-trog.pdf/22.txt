About Mexico
Though there may be plenty of laws, they are not as enforced as they are in the US, such as underage drinking,
drunk in public, speed limits.
Most things are made of concrete, very few wood or drywall.
Most floors are either concrete or tile, I think this is because every road is so muddy and they can clean tile
easier.
There are a lot of stray dogs that try to get food from people and stores. Zulema says that most have owners
and are vaccinated; most are not neutered.
Lots of people walk a long ways to get to work or the store. Made me shameful how lazy Americans are.
Eggs and some milk are not refrigerated and produce is sold long after it is ripe.
Most buildings have rebar sticking out of the top.
Saw no Pepsi.
The gas stations are all owned by the government, called Pemex. The prices are not advertised on the board.
