A place to get reacquainted with one's self and collect ones thoughts. Caves can factor into ones psyche
quickly if allowed. Sometimes in not so positive a manner for those who are prone to phobic tendencies.
Good news is it's just a matter of mind over matter in most cases. The will to push forward and achieve
new goals is a powerful motivator as is survival.
Caving is an adventure that takes stamina, determination, skill, and the ability to overcome obsta-
cles. Many a caver is on the trip for excitement of pushing the body to the next level. Later to find out
they have toned muscles they normally wouldn't have given second thought to. Caving gives a excellent
physical and even mental workout unlike any other. Whether horizontal or vertical anyone who does
much caving will be quick to be the student. Skill sets are learned along the way many of which will make
good use of physics to make the trip more enjoyable. Whether in search for facts or just sporting
through, these abilities, which can be attained through practice, will serve one well.
Of course, caving is not something done alone and is perhaps one of the best things about it. Cav-
ing lends to the opportunity to meet
new people and make new friends.
Whether these cavers be from grot-
tos or individuals many great friend-
ships can be forged participating in
the joys of caving. Before you know it
you are part of a second family and
all the better for it! Plus caves seem
to have all those wonderful sexual
monakers, for both sexes and all
those in between, for the added hu-
morous entertainment.
So when someone asks why
do you cave or why should I cave? |
could say a number of things which
are all true and valid. Instead I just
say I cave to live! Nothing like the joy
of a caver's life. except maybe a cav-
ers wife ha ha.
