Perhaps the best overviews of that period can be found in later Trog articles from those who were present to witness those
turbulent times. In the 1966 Winter Quarter Trog, the Editor (Gary McCutchen) writes:
Unfortunately, this period was marred by a debate over policy that threatened to split or destroy the
club. One group of members wanted rigid rules governing trips and a leadership code; the other mem-
bers preferred fewer rules and more reliance on the judgment of the members. The spokesmen of these
respective groups were George Fairer and Gregg Marland.
This “era of bad feelings" resulted in long, boring, debate-filled meetings, that disgusted potential
members and climaxed by a vote on whether or not to remove Gregg Marland from the club for an in-
fraction of the leadership code.
In the past 2 years, VPI has removed the leadership code from the constitution, devoted meetings more
toward caving, ... and has grown at an exponential rate.
An excellent history of the club by Mike Frieders and Bob Barlow was published in the Winter 1968 (Anniversary Edition) Trog,
which includes this summary:
Probably the most significant event in the grotto's history took place in 1965 when the constitution was
again revised to do away with the leadership code. This was followed by an overall increase in the cav-
ing activities of the Grotto, due to the fact that “qualified" trip leaders had been few, and as a result,
the trips had been limited. It was found that the added experience gained by the members in the course
of increased caving more than outweighed the benefits of the leadership system in making all the mem-
bers more safety conscious.
Today the Grotto is stronger than it has ever been in its twenty five year career. In 1965 the club be-
came symbolized by a troglodyte framed in a carabiner and brake bar. The jaunty patch describes the
attitude taken by the club members toward life above and below ground.
Twenty-six years after that was written none of the key points have changed. The training and membership requirements and
procedures that evolved during the turbulent 60s have worked well. The VPI Cave Club continues to produce competent cav-
ers with the knowledge and self-reliance to be responsible for their own safety decisions.
