Maze Cave Trip Recap
By Andrew Lycas
As somebody new to caving, I had been curious about if caves were mapped, then how
they were mapped, and when they were mapped. A survey trip was brought up to be led by
Nick Socky to Maze cave. Not knowing anything about maze cave or surveying, but having
the day free, I, along with Nick, Amy Skowronski, Alice Jaworski, Peter Southworth,
and Jennifer Wagner met up the next morning and headed off to maze cave.
After driving south on 81 for roughly a half hour into Pulaski county, and a two sec-
ond drive off an exit, we parked on the side of the road and met Don Anderson who was
waiting for us. He gave the group the rundown of some of the history of the cave, his
trips to survey, and the current state of the cave entrance and land owners. Geared up
and jobs assigned, we headed off to the entrance, which with Don's help was not diffi-
cult to find
Due to most people either doing a new survey job, or being on their first survey trip,
there was a quick lesson for the instrument people (Peter and myself), the lead tape
(Amy and Alice), and the sketchers (Nick and Jennifer). It was decided to double up on
surveying until the path split to give people the chance to confer with each other
what they were doing. Ready to go we started surveying.
Not even past the first station, we hit our first road block, instruments not being
read correctly. After learning the importance of the placement of the instruments when
reading them, we got readings that were close enough for us to move on.
The cave starts with a
rocky slope in for about
20 ft opening to a wider
room where a tight path
went to the right, and a
much wider path went on-
ward and to the left.
This room made a great
place to sit and wait
for the sketchers. Here
the group came across
two small brown bats on
the ceiling
