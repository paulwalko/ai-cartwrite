My Knot Collection
By Kelly McCarthy
I was supposed to learn knots
To study for the test
So I figured why not
And perused them with zest
The first I figured
The most common-the tie
So I followed what's pictured
It's easy to do but, I'm not a guy
Now for the knot to tie up my shoes
Oh my! It seems I tie mine all wrong
My older brother, I'd have to accuse
He showed me how and I followed along
Next exploring macramé
I hear they make lovely bracelets
Or can be used to decorate a passageway
Unfortunately they're not so basic
Hmm...now what to learn next
I can't think of any off the top of my head
What's that now, I misread the text
Oh yep, your right, it says learn the “required knots”
Whoops
A Haikou on caving by Peter Southworth
Darkness all around
Ever growing underground
Full of simple grace
