Official written records, such as minutes of the meetings, seldom portray the full depth and range of all issues of a time – in-
deed, many never even appear. So even brief mentions can infer a great deal of discussion and controversy that never makes it
into the record. One example is the discussion, in the minutes of the 1961-62 term, of an “unauthorized" trip by Ed Day into
Pig Hole (in October) - an incident that eventually is resolved by demoting Ed to "novice status" in lieu of the recommendation
by the Safety Committee that he be suspended for the remainder of the quarter. By May of 1962 competing motions are
brought before the club - one by Ed Day to completely repeal the Leader System (which was denied for consideration), and
another by George Fairer to incorporate 'improvements into the leader system. Little action was taken then, or for quite
awhile after, but the 'battle lines' were being drawn.
Throughout 1963 it seems there was much discussion, but little action. In the minutes of March 1, 1963, is a simple statement
about the resignation of the Club's Adviser, Dr Murray, with little other information. However, there is this revealing note on
page 7 of Scrapbook #2: "Dr Murray, Cave Club Adviser, resigned due to a change in club policy. Trips were to be allowed any
time, to any cave, with any members, with any leader, and without the approval of club officers." Murray had been the Adviser
to the Club since 1950, and been responsible for much of the safety code throughout those years. We can only guess that the
club policy was far ahead of the written bylaws, as his actions, while dramatic, seem quite premature with respect to the docu-
mentation. A new version of the constitution was approved only in May of 1963, with the associated Bylaws not approved until
the following Fall, and even so there is still an extensive section on Leader Qualifications. The policies for which Murray re-
signed in protest do not become codified until at least two years later, in 1965.
The 1963 Constitution and Bylaws established what is essentially the training program the club has today. There is a list of re-
quirements – very similar to current requirements - to become a Full Member of the club, with no mention of horizontal or
vertical classification. However, only "Qualified Leaders" were permitted to lead cave trips. Leaders were still classified by Hor-
izontal or Vertical, which effectively resulted in a 5-level member structure: Trainee, Full Member, Horizontal Leader, Vertical
Leader, and Lead Climb Leader (in order of increasing 'rank').
One episode that shows the disarray in policies and procedures during this period is a meeting of the Safety Committee on Feb-
ruary 17, 1964, in which there were several violations being considered for action. One involved a trainee taking an
"unauthorized trip with no leader”. This was eventually dismissed because copies of the constitution h
and there was "no training program oversight” - that is, there was no way for the trainee to have known he was in violation.
The most serious violation at this meeting was charged against Gregg Marland, former President, for improper belaying proce-
dure (belaying while not tied it - which would not be a violation of the current safety code). The Safety Committee recommen-
dation was to 'sentence' Marland to practice belaying by catching the belay dummy for 5 falls, using approved procedures. The
recommendations were brought before the Club on February 21 for a vote. An indicator of the passion behind the controversy
is the fact that the minutes list the vote for or against by each member. The 'sentence' was upheld by a very close vote of 12 to
11.
Following the vote Gregg Marland made a statement. He expressed approval of the goals and actions of the Safety Committee,
disapproval for the leadership system, and then refused to do the required 5 belays. He concluded by moving that, because of
his refusal, he be expelled by the club - a motion which was tabled.
The minutes of the next meeting are terse: "...the motion tabled from the previous (meeting) was brought unto the floor; the
motion was voted on by a secret ballot and was defeated. Gregg Marland moved that he be authorized to represent the VPI
Grotto (in NSS convention matters)”. One can only guess at the political theater behind those few words. In two sentences
they move from deciding not to expel Marland to considering appointing him to be an official club representative (no mention
is made of whether his motion was approved).
