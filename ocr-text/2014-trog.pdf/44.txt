It was decided to continue as a group of six in-
stead of splitting up and to take the larger
path to the left. It was obvious this was not
going to be the last time that we were going to
be surveying this cave, so Amy was assured she'd
get to explore the more interesting tight pas-
sage on the right.
The cave continued in a fairly easy path, with
Amy tying the lead tape, myself providing the
forward sights, Peter the back, Nick and Jen-
nifer sketching, and Alice providing support to
the sketchers. This section was full of small
talk, getting comfortable sitting in caves, and
at least on my end finding more and more com-
fortable ways to read the instruments. A hand
held flashlight turned out to be the best tool |
had in my bag for this trip.
Around station 9 or 10, Amy apologized for the
placement of the station. All the instrument
readers got their chance to be in this uncon-
Jennifer Wagner Sketching formable place. With about a foot between the
floor and roof, it had the best visibility to
future and past stations, but was just a pain to get an accurate reading from. It
was around here that Jennifer, being thoroughly done with sketching, passed the hon-
or off to Alice, and took over the back sight instrument readings from Peter.
The next station was placed at the first tight crawly squeeze of the trip. Unknown
to me there was another path to station 10, but we'd get to that later. Crawling up
the small passage lead into a taller room, which provided many seats for us to sit,
while the sketchers got the details of the curves of the squeeze and the shelves in
the room.
Up at roughly head level there was another small room, which needed scurrying up a
very steep muddy path. Up there the path ended, in a roughly 15 ft x 6 ft x 6 ft
room. We must have been close to the surface, as short segments of tree roots that
were visible on the roof.
