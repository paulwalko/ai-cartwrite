Rope Friends Conquer El Cap
By Robert Harris
I have a bad fear of heights. I get a sick-
ness in my stomach and I am overcome
with the emotion of dread. That is what
I felt on my first vertical cave trip with
VPL members John Bowling and Alex
Booker in 2010. While on rope climbing
out, I promised myself that my curiosity
was satisfied, and I'd had enough. If I
ever got out alive, I would never get
back on rope again. It only took me a
few months to forget how bad it was
and to join my local NSS grotto in NC,
the Triangle Troglodytes. I wanted to
learn what i'd done wrong, how to be
better on rope, and how to conquer my
fears.

Preparation
This trip report isn't so much about caving as it is about cavers using caving skills – specifically, Single
Rope Technique (SRT) extended to extreme height. This last summer VPI cavers John Deighan, Alex Book-
er, and I decided to join the VBATS ™ rappel team organized by our friend Tiny Make to rappel El Capitan
Mountain in Yosemite National Park. It seemed like a natural evolution to rappel off of the highest (open)
free rappel in the world. Mount Thor in Canada is closed due to rappeler death. The past three years I had
spent gaining experience by rappelling and climbing increasingly higher drops: Guaguas (700 ft), White-
sides (700 ft), Bridge Day (800 ft), and Golondrinas (1200 ft), but there was still quite a jump up to 2650 ft
at El Cap. I have found that I can get used to heights, but the fear creeps back during my normal life on
flatland. Pushing my fear to extremes seems to make lesser drops feel relatively less terrifying, at least to
some extent. The fact is that El Cap is so high, the distance does not register. It's like looking out of an air-
plane.
Rappelling El Cap requires an extra-long 24” rack with eight bars to be able to deal with the over 70 lbs of
rope weight tension at the top. Our own Steve Wells was nice enough to loan me his El Cap-proven rack
to use, which he supplemented with all the El Cap tips and stories I needed to really put me on edge.
When all was said and done, I liked the rack so much I bought my own. More bars and smaller bends in
the rope prevent the longer rack from accumulating as much heat as a shorter rack. Every year for the VPI
Mexico trip I trained by swimming and climbing rope. Tiny informed us that whatever shape we were in,
we needed to be in better, and that Yosemite would kick our butts. I trained until I was able to perform a
paced climb over 700 ft without resting, and able to swim 1.2 km before a break. I would climb 2,600 ft in
an evening with my training partner Peter Hertl, who holds the El Cap climbing record at 67:03.
