Climbing into Space
Our VBATS team required one week to rig, support rappelers, and derig.
Everyday tasks were assigned to each member, but luckily we still got plenty
of time to see the park and hike many of the trails. Alex climbed first around
sunset with our new friend Heleman. Deighan and I got our last meal in then
started our tandem climb sometime around midnight. The climb out of the
darkness of the valley up into the star-filled sky was beautiful. As the moon
set, the moonlight swept across the valley helping to hide the height that I
feared, but I knew it was still there, even when my eyes were closed. Stars
filled the dome of our vision. Deighan and I never saw the same shooting
star, but we each saw at least eight. It was like climbing up into space. Rock
climbers were (insanely) camped out on a few portaledges midway up El
Cap. Lights at the climber camps that started high above us sunk until they Our 3,000 rt rope hangs off El cap
were far below as we climbed unimaginably higher. It was possible to communicate with other lights on
the face of the wall and even people off in the valley by waving or flashing lights to say hello. We mainly
climbed quietly with our lights off; if you have enough breath to speak, you have enough breath to keep
climbing. The goal of the climb was the “diving board” where they put out red and green glow lights for us,
so we could see the edge, like an airplane in the distance. These two lights never seemed to get closer as
we climbed. Deighan worried that he might fall asleep while climbing because it was past his bedtime. I
tried not to look up to see how far they were because it seemed like it would be disheartening to see how
much of the impossible climb was left. “We're at the lights, Deighan...” “It's about time!” I radioed the top,
and team member Brian Stoltz woke up to help us off rope and show us where the camp was. One inter-
esting sensation on the climb was that I drank 2 L of Gatorade from my camelback, yet I had no need to go
to the bathroom before bed. With the dry air and altitude, without even getting sweaty, somehow 2L
evaporated from my body. I felt strange after that climb. I think it was the hardest thing 've ever done
athletically. Having never seen the top of El Cap before, finding a tent to sleep in up there in the dark was
interesting. It is the most “primo" camp site in the world, according to Peter.
The Descent
In the morning, we prepared for our descent. Deighan
served as edge attendant to put us on rope and send us
over. It takes a small support team to get over comforta-
bly. Two or three people must pull up on a haul line
though a 3:1 pulley system which is attached to the main
line by an upside down handled ascender. This enables
the rappeller to get over the edge and rappel down to the
ascender. The correct number of bars are applied while
jamming the rest. Both hands can be safely removed from
the rack at this point to remove the ascender and reattach
it above the rack. The bars can then be spread all the way
out to start moving down the rope for a 2630 ft rappel.
