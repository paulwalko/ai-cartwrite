standing in the stream once more.
This time take a left and go up
stream. You will have to climb up
one 10 foot waterfall (a belay will
be desired by some). The 20 foot
waterfall above is named Dragon
Falls. Here you will find a perma-
nently rigged rope, and unless you
want to get wet, ignore it. Go left
and up just before Dragon Falls.
You will cross over the top of a
step-across, then go through about
50 feet of crawl, miraculously re-
turning to the bottom of the first
drop. Follow your rope out.
TAWNEYS CAVE
by James Washington & Susan
Vermeulen
Requirements: horizontal, begin-
ner
One might consider this a multi-
cultural cave due in part to its high
traffic and notoriety. On any given
day, cavers in Tawneys may be
scouts, fraternity brothers, locals,
high school science classes, or lo-
cal grotto members. Often, 50 or
more people can be found in this
cave during the summer months.
Its friendliness, prettiness, histori-
cal value, and ease of access have
made this cave one of the best
known caves in the east. It has ap-
proximately one mile of passage
and three (some count four) en-
trances, so no route marking is
necessary; no matter which way
you go, you will find either a
short, dead-end passage or an en-
trance.
The usual expedition to Tawneys
Cave is basically an easy horizon-
tal cave trip. It makes a good intro-
duction to caving techniques and
safety measures; vertical exposure
up to 30 feet is possible. Most peo-
ple visit the Moon Room, the Salt-
petre Room and the sinkhole.
