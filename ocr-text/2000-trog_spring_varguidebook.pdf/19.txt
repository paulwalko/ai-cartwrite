THE SURVEY
On November 13th Phil Benchoff,
Dave Colatosti and myself were
back for the first survey trip. Be-
fore starting we constructed a de-
flector shield out of some scrap
wood and used some 4 x 4's to
shore things up a bit. The entrance
would need more work but we de-
cided to see if the caye went any-
where first. We mapped down to
the entrance room and then fol-
lowed a large canyon passage with
a small infeeder stream south for
about 80 feet to a 15 foot upclimb.
The small stream entered through
a short wide slot at the top of this.
We decided not to get wet just yet
and headed back to check the lead
heading west from the entrance
room. This passage seems to be a
continuation of the entrance fis-
sure and starts heading steeply
down hill. Two small intermediate
level passages intersected the bot-
tom of a dome we named the Rats
Dome. When Phil first looked in
here he found two glowing eyes
staring back at him from the other
side. We suspect the rat found his
way in through another entrance
too small for us. The dome is 40
feet tall with a twenty-foot drop-
off to a lower level on one side.
We backed up and found our way
down a small hole through break-
down. At the bottom, a large
breakdown slab shaped like the
monolith from 2001 sits like a
sliding board to the bottom of the
room below the dome. All of the
airflow was heading this way and
there was a considerable amount
of it. After only 20 feet, however,
the passage narrows to about 3
inches wide, 15 feet high and
much too long to consider blast-
ing. This is the lowest point in the
cave so far to 91 feet below the en-
trance. A small keyhole shaped
opening at the top of this was
saved for smaller cavers. With less
