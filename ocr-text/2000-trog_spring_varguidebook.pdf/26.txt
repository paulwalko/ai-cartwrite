documented (new) species. The
species has yet to be named. Sug-
gestions from cave club members
have included Pseudotremia bas-
tardi, Pseudotremia ceciliusinkius,
and Pseudotremia ty. I am partial
to Pseudohumanbeingia lepera.
Once Scooter's was about dead,
we turned our attention to the
spout. Joe, Matt, and Zenah decid-
ed to push it on Sunday in the Au- :
tumn of 199 after hearing from
Wells that a human could actually
fit and that there might be cave.
Thompson entered first. After
some grunting and groaning, loud
cursing preceded a
rapid exit. “$#@!$
coons," he said.
Upon hearing the
word coon, or per-
haps catching the
scent, Ty made a
beeline for the entrance and disap-
peared. A few seconds later, bark-
ing started. Cecil recognized Ty's
distinctive “face-barking,” and as-
sured as that meant the raccoons
were safely cornered. Joe, Matt,
and Zenah went in and started the
survey. Ty kept the coons at bay
the whole time (5 hours). Zenah
describes seeing three masked fac-
es peering out of the darkness, in
tremulous terror of the terrible Ty.
The nature of Ty's Spout, as we
have named it, is essentially tight,
clean crawling with lots of cork-
screw turns. Although only just
over 100 feet long, it took two
trips to survey it because people
kept getting stuck. On the second
trip, Rance Edwards and Eileen
replaced Zenah the caver warrior
princess, yet still couldn't fill her
boots. The coons weren't there on
the second trip, presumably forced
to emigrate by Ty.
A unfortunate sad footnote to this
story is that Ty the caving dog
died in an accident this winter. At
least he was doing what he loved
best, terrorizing other mammals,
in this case mice, when it hap-
pened. Those of us who caved or
just hung out with
Ty will never for-
get his smooth, yet
intense personali-
