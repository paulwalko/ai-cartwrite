that John's parents live in Giles
County and have a neighbor with a
number of sinkholes on their prop-

how a number of years ago they
had diverted a stream into one of
these sinkholes. The stream nor-
mally sinks but would occasional-
ly wash out their grayel driveway
during floods. This all sounded
very interesting to Phil and he of
course relayed the story to me.
