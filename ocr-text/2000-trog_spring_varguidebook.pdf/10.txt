There are two ways on from the
base of the waterfalls: a belly
crawl up stream in low-water con-
ditions, or a 12 foot free climb up
the right side of the waterfall to a
passage which loops overhead,
then continues through a fissure to
the Boulder Room. A long hand
line is advisable for the climb. In
New River Cave, some 2,200 feet
beyond.
Take time to look into the nooks
and side passages; that is where
you will find much beauty. There
are plenty of small wonders
throughout the cave, but often
they're out of view from tourist
ety of dripstone formations. To
reach the upper loft, first traverse
the boulders to the east, then cut
back west, up to a high room.
Look for the pool drilled into the
center breakdown. At the eastern
end of the Attic Room is a beauti-
ful flowstone wall. The Forest
Room, given its name because of
its forest of stalactites and
stalagmites, is protected by a .
twisted, concealed trip route.
Without a map, or a knowl-
edgeable guide, you can
waste hours searching for this
elusive room. Be careful to
avoid damaging pretties
along the way, and take a
handline for one modest
traverse. These upper-level
rooms are ideal for a morning
or afternoon trip.
Water trickles from the Attic
Room down under the break-
down to the Lunch Room,
then through crevasses to the
stream. A trip to the waterfall
continues from the Lunch
Room upward, to start, down
the China Slide passage to the
stream, then up and down, up
and down, generally following the
stream. Sometimes you will crawl,
sometimes you'll be in water -
normally the water is only boot
deep. Inexperienced cavers invari-
ably can't find their way through
this section. Approaching the wa-
terfall, you'll take a siphon bypass
up through the Airblower venturi,
and chimney down a ten foot hole
once again to the stream. A hand
line or belay is advisable for the
beginner. The waterfall is a couple
hundred feet beyond. The 40 foot
free drop which intersects the
main stream is impressive, even
though the volume is not. This wa-
ter comes from the perched water
table above the cave. Expert rock
climbers can continue up above
the first falls to a second eight foot
waterfall, and another nine foot
fall above that.
James Cave is one of the more decorated caves in the area. Note the carbide lamp for scale.
