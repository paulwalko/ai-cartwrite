Kirk and Dave have spent nine
years surveying New Starnes,

cave. They performed three bolt
climbs to explore the high leads
and found five more streams.

BIOLOGY
I have found several crawfish and
salamanders in the streams and
pools near the 60 foot waterfall.
The largest crawfish that I have
found is about two and half inches
long. I have yet to find a white or
blind crawfish, but some of the
crawfish are lacking their full pig-
ment. There are also reports in the
club files that both a bullfrog and
a common toad were found in the
streams, presumably washed in
from the surface streams. An
abundance of bugs including spi-
ders and cave crickets can be
found, especially near the en-
trance.
During the winter, many bats can
be found hibernating in the cave.
The most common are the Little
Brown Bat, Eastern Pipistrelle,
and an occasional Big Brown Bat.
Interestingly, bats have been seen
in New Starnes, leading to specu-
lation that there may be another
entrance. No entrance has been
found, but Lost Promise has been
witnessed to blow some very cold
air during the winter.
Many thanks to: Lawrence Britt
for access to the club files and tak-
ing the time to talk to me about his
explorations. Dave Colatosti and
Kirk Digby for taking the time talk
to me about their explorations and
taking me “Starnesing" and teach-
ing me how to survey.
