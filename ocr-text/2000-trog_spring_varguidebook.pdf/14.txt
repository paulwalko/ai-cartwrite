climbed by Mike Futrell, Jack Ke-
hoe, and Paul Kirchman in early
1989. This series of short climbs,
(34 feet, 13 feet, 11 feet, 13 feet),
was dubbed The Golden Showers.
Over a mile of predominantly
muddy fissure passage has been
mapped beyond with names like
“Dog Food,” “Arduous Canyon,"
and the “Chestnut Ridge Fun
Spot” where Doug Bruce spent far
more time than he would have
liked.
There are many additional bits and
pieces not described here, but one
may anticipate them all to be ei-
ther small, muddy, both, or worse,
and end before getting any better.
YER CAVE
by Mike Futrell
Requirements: vertical, advanced
Yer Cave offers pits of 12 feet,
127 feet, 52 feet, 10 feet, and 35
feet to access the lower levels. A
separate 50 foot pit may be substi-
tuted in place of the 127 foot and
52 foot combination pits. The en-
trance to the cave is in a large
sinkhole used as a junk pit. The
entrance is a narrow 12 foot pit (35
foot rope) under a boulder at the
far end of the sinkhole. The obvi-
ous passage just inside ends in a
pinch after about 450 feet. This
portion of the cave was previously
explored, though not reported, by
Bob Alderson and others in the
1970's. The main cave was found
by Mike Futrell and Doug Bruce
on June 20, 1987 by digging
through the breakdown near the
bottom of the entrance drop. A.
breakdown crawl and short down-
climb opens into a small room.
From here a hole in the floor leads
to the Vegetable Crawl (survey
your vegetables before your des-
sert) and the upper levels. Or by
following the obvious crawl for 30
feet the top of the Pleasure Greed
Pits can be reached. Suitable natu-
ral rigging can be found through
the crawlway and an adjacent
small hole which open to the top
of the pit. A 150 foot rope should
be sufficient for this 127 foot pit.
Loose rock still remains in the
chocked breakdown void which
serves as the top of the pit. Care
should be taken. Pad, then rappel
through the obvious hole in the
breakdown to a large balcony be-
low. A large obvious chock rock
provides rigging for the next pitch.
An additional 100 feet of rope is
sufficient. Pad the abrupt lip well
before descending 52 feet to the
middle level.
Upper Level
The Vegetable Crawl is a narrow
fissure followed by a contorting
“S” bend. A crawl is joined which
leads down to a fissure intersec-
tion. (This junction may not be ob-
vious on the way out.) A popcorn
fissure leads to a short downclimb
and a larger intersection. To the
left is a canyon leading to Jack's
Drop (50 feet) which also accesses
the mid-levels. This drop can be
rigged naturally with a boulder
way back the passage and then
over a bad lip with 150 feet of
rope, or with two Petzl 8 mil hang-
ers (which may or may not be
there) as is more often done.
Straight ahead is the upper level of
the cave. Continuing in this upper
level, a couple infeeders immedi-
ately join from the left. Also on
the west is the larger Flaming
Glove Passage, named after the
misfortunes of an inattentive nov-
ice. This is the western most point
in the cave. Further along, the
main passage joins the Rain Room
and associated crawls.
Mid Level
Whether reached by Jack's Drop
on the west end, or the Pleasure
Greed Pits in the middle, the mid-
level is first seen as a 20 to 40 foot
wide canyon 200 feet long. Of the
big obvious continuations on the
north side of the canyon, one im-
mediately slopes down to a swim
and several hundred feet of addi-
tional passage. The way on is in
the opposite direction along a mud
bank to a 10 foot nuisance drop
(awkward natural or 8 mil Petzl
hanger). This is immediately fol-
lowed by a nasty 35 foot muddy
slope drop to the stream passage.
A mud covered rock in the floor is
used for rigging.
Lower Level
The stream can be followed for a
couple hundred feet to a sump. A
walking size overflow leads to the
Pudding Room (the dessert) on the
far side of which is the sump and
lowest point in the cave at -271
feet. A large high-lead on the east
side of the Pudding Room was
