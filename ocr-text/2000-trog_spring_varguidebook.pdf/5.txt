The Hike to Starnes
by Sarah Husband
i imagine snow covered
soft hills
whipping wind
releasing and tugging
on wisps of brown hair
ice stings and
your cheek is red
framed by gray blue
background snowclouds
clouds touch the tips of mountains
in a ziplock seal which protects us from
the sound
escaping our red lips
shining with saliva
a song
none and particular
and none that we can remember
all the words to
but we do remember
our last lifetime together
I pleasure in the dark
outlines of your form
and we continue down
the hill
