Links Cave is often described as a
orated cave, it is a climber's
3-D jungle gym. It is mostly dry
delight. The landowner requests
that only vertically experienced
people visit; this is not a cave for
beginners. Once at the property,
check in with the landowner and
sign in. Parking is normally just
beyond the gate in inclement
weather, although the owner may
let you drive up to the entrance.
ALWAYS ASK! He is very con-
cerned about erosion on the hill.
There is a gate in the fence sur-
rounding the pit. Please tie the
gate shut every time you pass
through. As the owner's son com-
mented once, “Who would want a
cow falling on them while on
rope?" The entrance area is VERY
slippery when wet!
The trip starts with a 78 foot rap-
pel down the entrance pit followed
by a series of straddle pits. The
first room beyond is the Meander
Room, a central location with
many major routes converging. To
the east is the Elevator, a steep
shaft that has no handholds: it is a
pure ceiling-floor friction decent.
At the bottom is the Elevator
stream which is a common pas-
sage to almost the whole cave. Just
beyond the top of the Elevator is
the Butt Ledge, so named for a
common way to cross it. It is a
sheer 30 foot pit below. Halfway
across are two bolts that were used
long ago for belays. The first one
dates before 1960, the other dates
around 1970. A regular belay
clipped in to these might hold; use
caution. Beyond this area is Dou-
ble Wells, twin 90 foot pits with
sheer walls. A popular trip is to
rappel, then climb back up from
the bottom through a breakdown
route. Beyond here are three more
rappel areas that are more trouble
than a sport trip warrants. The first
is an unnamed 81 foot pit that ends
in a sump. A minimum of five
rope pads are needed here. This is
currently the deepest spot in the
cave at 240 feet. The second is

ently by dropping a rock that
