parent leads off the top of this
dome. A subsequent surface sur-
vey showed nothing on the surface
at this point. However, continuing
in the same direction for another
100 feet a sizable stream sinks in a
large rubble-filled drainage di-
vide. We have not yet encountered
this water underground. The sec-
ond survey team quickly deter-
mined the tight spot was a no go so
they worked on a high lead that
passed over top of the Rats Dome
hoping to find a way over top and
down the other side. This upper
passage passes several small
domes before ending in a small
room. An upper lead continues a
short distance but is blocked by
surface cobbles. A hole leading
down in this room was check by
Steve Wells who said “DON'T
GO IN THERE. That is some of
the scariest fucking shit I've ever
seen.” This is coming from a per-
son who bottomed Cheve with a
trip we borrowed a scaling pole in
order to reach a high lead heading
north just off the entrance room.
This passage continues heading up
for about 30 feet to where it ends
in a cobble fill. We then mapped
an upper level of passages above
the waterfall and heading back to-
wards the entrance. Another 40
foot dome was found and a possi-
ble dig. While we were surveying
we began to notice a considerable
increase in the noise coming from
the stream below us. Rain outside
had dramatically increased the
amount of water entering the cave.
With the increased amount of wa-
ter we were able to follow it down
to below the Rats Dome to where
it sank down through the gravel
and breakdown on the floor.
Another trip a week later to push
leads found the entrance had filled
in after the heavy rains. A couple
of large rocks will have to be
moved before we can gain access
-
than 300 feet surveyed we called it
a day. I believe it was sometime
around here we decided we need-
ed a name for our cave. Nothing
really stood out about the cave but
the big news around this time was
the Y2K bug and the impending
end of the world. I had also just
found out I would have to work
New Years Eve "just in case." Phil
and I agreed that Why To Cave
was just too good to pass up.
When else would we have an op-
portunity like this? Sorry for all
you cavers reading this 999 years
from now, but Why Three Cave
just sounds stupid
One week later we were back.
John Deighan, Kirk Digby and
myself would climb the waterfall
while Steve LePera, Steve Wells
(on loan from Bill Balfour and the
DMC Mega Dome Climb) and Ei-
leen O'Malley would try to push
the tight spot where the air was go-
ing. Above the waterfall we
mapped two parallel passages
each heading southwest for about
100 feet. The left-hand passage
started out 8 feet high and 2 to 3
feet wide but soon turned into a
crawl. It ends with an 8 inch high
wet muddy crawl about 10 feet
long with a 20 foot dome at the
end. There are no possible leads at
the end of this passage. The right
hand passage starts out as a very
narrow crevice about 10 feet long.
A hole at the end of this drops
down a few feet to the stream pas-
sage but it is too small to follow.
Continuing straight, the passage
widens a bit and a 20 foot dome
with no leads is passed on the left.
The passage then splits into upper
and lower level crawls. Both pas-
sages reconnect after 50 feet and
continue to a tight breakdown
filled crawl. This lead still needs
to be pushed. At this point a large
dome is found to the left. We were
able climb up this to a point 25
feet higher then the entrance. The
top of the dome is perhaps another
40 feet higher. There were no ap-

scary things in caves than anyone
I know. I think I'll take his word
for it.
Our next and last survey trip
didn't come until March. On this
again. I often wonder how soon af-
ter we got out of the cave that it
collapsed. We still have at least
one potential dig on the surface
that may find us another cave. All
of that water and air has to be go-
ing somewhere. Oh, by the way,
