Welcome to Spring VAR 2000!
by Sandy Knapp, Chairman
Giles and surrounding counties
have experienced a flurry of ex-
ploration and survey activity with-
in the past year. Some of this has
been pushing and remapping ex-
isting caves, while some is map-
ping newly discovered caves.
With all of this activity focusing
on surveying, we thought we'd
share some of our stories and new
maps with the members of the Vir-
ginia Region. This guidebook is
our way of letting you know
what's going on.
We hope you are as excited as we
are to know that there are still
caves out there just waiting for
discovery!
Also, you may notice something a
bit strange about the back of this
guidebook. Since this VAR coin-
cides with the time our club news-
letter is usually published, we
thought we'd combine the two
publications to give everyone a
chance to see them both. Enjoy
our grotto gossip, trip reports, and
artistic efforts.
Thanks to all who donated tarps,
equipment, time, and energy to
make this a great weekend for ev-
eryone.
CAMPGROUND RULES
While our ultimate goal is that ey-
eryone has a wonderful weekend,
we do have some rules which we
expect you to heed:
1. Please wear your name tag
while in camp. You need this for
Saturday night's dinner and bever-
ages. The tags are color-coded:
yellow for staff, green for over 21,
and red for under 21.
2. No nudity in the campground.
This is a public place and we're
obliged to follow the rules.
3. Alcohol consumption is permit-
ted, but please use discretion
around families who are not part
of the VAR group.
4. No underage drinking. Sodas
are available for the under 21
crowd.
5. Please keep pets on a leash.
6. There will be a large bonfire on
Saturday night. Keep individual
campfires within designated areas.
MED TENT
We will have basic medical sup-
plies available at a tent near the
Registration table, but this will not
be staffed with medical personnel.

Notes on Cave Trips
All self-lead trips should contact registration about the access policies and guidelines for the cave you plan
to visit. Directions to local caves may be acquired at the Registration table. We will have a cave trip log book
available at registration, and we encourage you to record your cave trips. Note: this book is not intended as a
signout! Please sign out with your friends by letting them know what cave you plan to visit and when you plan
to be back at the campground.
Clover Hollow Cave - you must sign the Clover Hollow guest book at the Registration table. In addition, please
pick up “We Cave Responsibly” placards and display one in the windshield of all vehicles parked outside the
cave.
New River Cave - no waivers are necessary, however the landowner requests that those who have never been
to this cave should go to Registration and get on a lead trip. He kindly opened the cave for us this weekend only.
Pig Hole Cave - the only trips to this cave will be lead trips organized at Registration. In addition, only verti-
cally experienced cavers are permitted on these trips.
Please remain respectful of the landowners and their property. Our local grottos have worked hard to keep rela-
tions good, and the result is that we're able to host this VAR to share “our” caves with out-of-towners.
