A survey of cave surveyors was RESULTS BY INSTRUMENT TYPE:
conducted this year in conjunction
with the Spring VAR information-
al web page. The survey asked
Currently
each participant their age, how Instrument Prefer
long they had been surveying, and
(%)
what their instrument preferences
were. In addition, there was room
Suunto
for comments and desired im-
provements over the currently Brunton
available instrumentation.

There was some issue of the dis-
tinction between the many differ-
ent models of Sisteco, Silva (who
owns Sisteco, SurveyMaster etc.)
and Suunto. A few responses
placed their preference under
Suunto but later in the comments
identified which specific model
they were using. As seen in the ta-
ble, for the purposes of the “Cur-
rently Preferred Instrument” result
the distinctions are not really rele-
vant; the Suunto style instruments
are clearly the most popular.
The amount of experience and age
of the surveyors doesn't appear to
be a very significant factor in
choice of instrument.
In fact, the most significant deter-
mination of which instrument is
currently preferred is what instru-
ment the surveyor first learned.
68% of the respondents still prefer
to use the instrument they first
learned.
56% of the responders had used a
Suunto as their first survey instru-
ment, while 32% used a Brunton
the first time.
The landslide reason most Suunto
users gave for preferring their in-
strument was “Easy to use."
Toughness and ability to make an
awkward reading quickly were the
second and third most important
features listed.
Among the surveyors that pre-
ferred Brunton transits, the most
important feature was the sighting
and balancing system. A related
response was that this sighting
system is better for high angle
measurements.
Interestingly, the third most com-
mon wish of Suunto users was a
better sighting and balancing
method, while the Brunton users
wished for a tougher instrument
(especially resistant to the mirror
getting broken) and a better cli-
nometer!
Suunto users strongly wished for a
more waterproof design, and one
in which the eyepiece was easier
to clean or replace.
The most common desire for ALL
instruments was some kind of in-
ternal lighting system. Even users
of newer models which have inter-
nal light sources complained that
the current lights were not water-
proof enough or not bright enough
to be worthwhile in many situa-
tions.
Another hope common among
many of the surveyors was an
electronic readout, memory, and
possible download of data from
the instrument to a computer later.
Users responses were pretty even-
ly split (no pun intended) on
whether having the compass and
clino together in the same unit is
good or bad. Several Suunto users
say having the separate instru-
ments get tangled about their neck
is a pain, but at the same time oth-
ers like their lighter, compact size.
One surveyor says he likes the
separate instruments because if
one gets broken, the whole unit
doesn't need to be returned. Of
course, who is going surveying
with only a clino or only a com-
pass?
I haven't priced any of these in-
struments, but the general senti-
ment among the responses was
that the Suunto instruments can be
had at a lower price.
Anyway, I'd like to thank every-
one who responded for their par-
ticipation, and wish everyone
blunder-free work in the future.
Here's to getting some new, high-
tech instruments out in the field in
the near future!
