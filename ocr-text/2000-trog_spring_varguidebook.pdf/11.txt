sided sinkhole about 500 feet be-
yond (northeast) of Starnes Cav-
erns and a few yards before a
boundary fence line. Just inside,
past large hairy spiders, is a down-
ward crawl to the right, followed
by a wiggly fissure which opens
into a small room. The cave can
generally be followed by crawling
in the small stream or scrambling
through the breakdown over the
stream. There are several small
spots and a fair bit of loose break-
down. Towards the end of the cave
an infeeder joins from the left.
This is part of the same stream
which disappears in the sinkhole.
It can be followed up a low, wet
bedding plane named the Remind-
er Crawl by Ko Takamizawa who;
while lying in the stream feeling
like a sponge said, “This reminds
me of real caving.” Although the
crawl ends under the entrance
there is no connection to the en-
trance passage. The cave ends in a
small sump, but the water reap-
pears several hundred feet later in
Starnes Caverns. Air flows
through breakdown and small fis-
sures at several points along the
south wall, likely in route to Star-
nes.

Smokehole is a major resurgence
for Clover Hollow Cave. The cave
has approximately 2 miles of pas-
sage, some of which is accessible
only during dry weather. Like
most caves with this name, it gen-
erates a large plume of water va-
por from the upper entrance in the
winter.
A “dry" trip to Smokehole begins
at the upper entrance down vary-
ing slopes and downclimbs. This
entrance may be difficult to find.

direction, Wildcat Run descends
steeply, then cuts sharply right
then left to a downclimb leading to
the mud bridge across Hess' Hol-
low. Extreme caution should be
taken here due to slippery surfaces
and a drop-off of approximately
90 feet. A handline or belay
should be used. One may rig a 150
foot rope to a jug handle on the
wall to drop into Hess' Hollow,
3 hours of leisurely caving. An
ambitious vertical trip may take
up to seven hours.
