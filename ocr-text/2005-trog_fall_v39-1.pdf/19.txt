Vertical Session 2005 Cont.

Compared to other caving trips I had heard call to the Blacksburg Police...I learned all
about, these guys also had the greatest about how safe the Sign-out station is- but
concern for safety. If you didn't have a that's another story. All in all I was impressed,
helmet, three available sources of light, and the bat ranch is gorgeous, I was hooked on
a heat source (carbide is warm...) you weren't caving, and the people in the club seem to
going into the cave. People double and triple look out for you-I can think of no better way
checked your safety equipment before you to go about a sport like caving than that.
