The Cave
By Dustin Schleifer
This is my goodbye to all that I know,
Caving will be my end and swiftly will I go.
For when plummeting to ground in the pure pitch black,
Your end is uncertain and all hope is what you lack.
Death from fear will be the outcome of the event,
And in mere seconds will my life will be spent.
I can only hope for the ones I love,
That they understand that this is not death from above.
What they should feel at this moment
Is that death was not my opponent.
It will be my own mind that brings about my demise,
An internal suicide to cease the thoughts that arise.
Whether it is meant to be in the coming year,
Or in my old age when I forget the fear.
Death will come to visit and I will surely not fight,
Because all will happen when the time is right.
