Getting To Know You! Con't.
I am Mark Eisenbies, in Forestry
for 13+ years. What is sex? If I could
be an animal I would be invisible.
I am Ed Fortney, a Family Develope-
ment Red Shirt Senior, from my mother.
I am looking for a person with a full
set of teeth. My first caving experi-
ence was at Yogi's Cave, King Domin-
ion. If I could be any animal it would
be a slug, because I always leave a trail.
I am Philip Balister, a 10+ year major-
ing in EE from England. I am looking for
a girl that that has large breasts, looks
good in a bikini and is a good instrument
reader. If I could be any animal it would
be a squirrel, they can climb all over.
I am Scott Rapier, 7th year Horti-
culture. First caving experience was
Tawneys. If I could be any animal it
would be a adolescent elephant, wait-
ing to be disciplined by older elephants.
I am Evets (Steve Lepera), a 19th
year ME. I am looking for a girl
that is easy. If I could be any ani-
mal it would be a rabbit. (see italic)
