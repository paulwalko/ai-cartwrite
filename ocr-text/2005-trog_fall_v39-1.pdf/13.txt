Wedding Tips To the Upcoming Caver Bride
By Samantha Garguilo
8. Phone Calls The Next Morning- You
know you had a decent wedding
when you get phone calls the next
morning from your guest apologizing
for their behavior the night before.
Do Not Listen To The Wedding
Professionals- The wedding professionals
(photographer, dress makers, wedding
coordinators, etc.) are out there for one thing
to get you to spend more money. You will
hear things like “you should wear this, you
will look more like a bride”, “we really don't do
that for weddings”, oh and my favorite “your
guest will not last past a 4 hour reception”
10. Most Important- Things will go wrong, it
always does. And you will have some guest
that feel it is their duty to point these out
to you. Just remember nothing is ever
perfect. Don't stress about it and remember
to have fun because your guest are.
1. No Rain Plan- DO NOT have a rain
plan, rain is good luck, plus if it rains
it will make the ceremony go faster
which will make all your guest happy.
2. Cut Corners To Save Money. The average
wedding cost about $26,000, so save your
family and yourself money by using your
talented friends instead of professional
cake makers, florist, photographers,
complimenting guests, musicians, DJs,
invitation/program manufactures and
wedding coordinator. This will also
get your smart talented friends out
of having to buy you a wedding gift.
3. The Groom Does Not Care- As long as both
of you show up and there is someone there
that can marry you, then he does not care
about the rest. He might have an opinion
on one or two things; so let him have his say
it will make him feel that he contributed.
4. You Can Not Get Rid of Tradition
Altogether- No matter when you cut the
cake or dance with your new husband,
your guest will stop and watch or will not
dance until you do. So do all the boring
traditional stuff as soon as you can to
get it out of the way for the fun stuff.
5. Toys at the Reception- Make sure you have
something for your caver guest to play with at
the tables. This will keep them entertained
until you get through all the boring stuff.
6. DO NOT Leave Your Reception Early-
Plan to leave for your honeymoon a day
or two after you wedding. This will allow
you to stay for your whole reception. If not
you could miss out on a lot of fun. Your
guests are there to celebrate your wedding.
Once you leave it is just another party.
7. Beverages- Supply your guest with
beverages they can drink throughout the
night and not regret until the morning.
This will allow for some great stories
to come for weeks after the wedding.
These are just some tips that could help
you when planning your wedding.
