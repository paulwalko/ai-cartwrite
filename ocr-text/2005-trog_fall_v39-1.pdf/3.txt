P-COKE
I am Jenny Ferdetta, a undecided fresh-
man, from VA. I am looking for a guy
who wears a mask and cape, has lots of
gadgets, can fix things I break and likes
hightime. My first caving experience
was at Tawney's. If I could be any ani-
mal it would be a bat; I could fly, sleep
through the whole day and eat bugs.
I am Sara Kleinsteuber, a freshman in
Biology, My first caving experience was
at Starnes. I am looking for someone
who is honest, can carry on a conversa-
tion, and does whatever I tell them to.
Calchs Story
I am Steven Davis, a 3rd year major-
ing in ChE. My first caving experi-
ence was Tawney's. I am looking for a
girl that is well rounded, The stripper
from last night. If I could be any ani-
mal it would be a Kangaroo, why not?
I am Caleb Magruder, a Freshman
majoring in EE, from VA. If I could
be an animal I would be a cat be-
cause they are peacful, lazy animals
TITT
I am Thercesa Economos, a Fresh-
man Animal and Poultry Sciences ma-
jor, from VA. If I could be any animal
it would be a bird, they're my favorite!
I am Judi Wasilewski, Jerry's Boss
from VA. First caving experience
was Tawneys, do I need to say more?
Size matters when it comes to the
opposite sex. If I could be any ani-
mal it would be a bird so I can fly.
