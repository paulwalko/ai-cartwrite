Rosepetal Snowflake
by Mark Eisenbies and Philip Balister :: ::
Some days it just pays to not cave. As Lao Tsu once said, "The softest thing in the
universe overcomes the hardest thing in the universe. That without substance can enter
where there is no room. Hence I know the value of non-action". While that may be all-
you need to know about caving, it doesn't work for digging.
On September 13, 2003, Philip Balister, Scott Rapier, Carrie Blankenship, Rob Story, and
Mark Eisenbies embarked on a somewhat uninspired trip to Buddy Penley's Caye; in
Bland County, Va. The first sign of the rift in motivation was apparent upon our arrival
to the Son of Picnic campsite and Spot exits the vehicle already salivating for a large :
steak. Apparently he and Carrie had managed to completely displace their inclination to
go underground with a desire to eat red meat. I was, of course, there to play with my
newly operational LED array. Philip and Rob still had dreams of doing some real caving.
As a whole we managed to poke around for 2 1/2 hours before passing by the entrance
and losing myself to the outside. In my mind I was following Spot and Carrie, but Philip
apparently managed to get them to go play in the maze before they could escape.
Napping topside for an hour I was finally woke by Philip and Spot ber√§ting me for
bugging out of the cave before it was their idea.
That's where the day would have ended were it not for my obsession with Fletch Hole. It
didn't take much convincing to get the rest of the group to go stare at Skydusky's biggest.

Now, for those of you who don't know the
particular significance of Fletch Hole, it resides
between two spur ridges that are bounded by
several well-known caves to the east as well as
to the west (Figure 1). The total length of these
caves would be 20-something miles if the
connections were ever found. Three
dimensional line plots reveal a veritable swiss
cheese of cave passage except for the area
under these two ridges. You barely need to
know how to spell speleogenesis to know what
that could mean.

Fletch has been a particular tease with all the
rain this past winter, and a lot of active
meander near the streams sink. Every visit
yields a different stream behavior, and this day
was no different. Picnic yielded a failed dam
project (something to do), and people poking,
their heads in every sink in the vicinity. Craig
