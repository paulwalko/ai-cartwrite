Sunday, Sept 28, 2003. Tom Malibad, Tim Bleech and Philip Balister eviscerate the
solution tube and pack every extra crevice in the rest of the cave with mud. It became
apparent that this dig is to be more of a commitment, so efforts currently focus on making
it a user-friendly dig.
Saturday, Oct 4. Large crew worked to extract the mud from the trip before. The mud,
being the consistency of peanut butter proves to be very difficult to remove from bags.
An experiment making a bucket from an 18-inch traffic cone turns out to be a boon for
mud removal. Kept clean, mud plops out of it like a teflon pot. Digging crews have
since revolted against the bags.
Status:
The cave now stands at approximately 50 feet in total length. It begins with a 6 ft drop
into the main hole, a pinch and climb down another 10 feet to the floor of a narrow
canyon-room. The first dig involves a crawl under a ledge to the left then opens to a
larger canyon-room. It's still blowing from two leads and the solution tube looks like it'll
go as long as you want to keep digging in it. The other dig will require more advanced
digging efforts because it is mostly rock. The trend of the cave is into the mountain, and
toward Ed Devine's Buddy Penley's surveys. However, we are 100's of feet away and it
is impossible to tell what will happen. Ideally we'll move another 100 ft into the
mountain where we hypothesize we might get some contact over our heads.
The priority for now will be to stabilize the entrance before the winter freeze/thaws close
it in and send more mud than we've pulled out down the entrance. Effective digging
requires crews of six or more because mud has to go from the digging site, all the way
out the entrance.
