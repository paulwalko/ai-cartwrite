Monday, 01/12/04. 5:03pm. Re: Tawneys Gate Question: Dave C. and Kirk did some modification to the
removable part of the main gate yesterday at the bat ranch. I haven't heard if it made it any easier to
get on and off or not.
Back when I was a Jersey caver this is how we built caye gates. check out the last couple of pictures.
(http://www.metgrotto.com/tripreports/trip_report.php?report_id=9). It's an 18" diameter steel pipe
with a solid stainless steel door on the inside. The last picture shows someone reaching through a 4"
pipe to reach the lock on the inside which is covered by a piece of steel. Someone still managed to
break into it by hauling an oxy-acetylene torch 1 mile through the woods reaching through the hole and
melting the lock off. Bats have been seen using the 4" pipes to enter and exit the cave.
If your going to make a gate easy to open you might as well not bother putting one on because it won't
last. At least on a cave as popular as Tawneys anyway.
Monday, 01/12/04.5:12pm. Kirk & Dave's gate “improvements”: Yes, the grinding made it MUCH easier to
avoid jamming the 2 lock gate at the main entrance. Dave also donated some WD-40 which is now
inside the cave for use on the locks. This may or may not help. They are not doing so well in the dirty
wet environment.
Monday, 01/12/04.5:20pm. Re: Tawneys Gate Question: I don't agree with that statement. It's certainly
possible to make a gate easy to open - given that you have the key or combination - and yet difficult to
break into. Perhaps with all the engineers (real or imagined) that we have in the club, we can come up
with some ideas. I feel a "cave gate design” contest coming on.
Of course, if you haul enough equipment to the cave entrance, you'll certainly be able to break through
any gate you wish. However, at Tawney's, Mike or someone else would discover it very quickly, so I
can't see anyone going to that much trouble for a single caye trip, which might end with the group
being arrested,
