Tawney's Cave - Giles County, VA
The property containing the two roadside entrances to Tawney's Cave has been in the Link family for
generations. The Link family feels that they are fortunate to have such a superb natural treasure on
their property and have always been happy to allow others to enjoy their caye. However, in recent
years, the number of groups visiting Tawney's has increased dramatically. With that rise in traffic the
number of individuals behaving irresponsibly on the property and in the cave has also increased. In
addition, there has been a noticeable impact on the entrance slopes and also within the cave. Several
incidents of vandalism on the Link's property finally led them to limit access to the caye, and ask local
cavers about the possibility of a gate to deter unauthorized access.
The roadside entrances to Tawney's were gated November 15th and 16th, 2003. To relieve traffic and
disturbance on the Link's property, Mike Newsome has agreed to manage the keys to the gate and
allow cave visitors to park on his property.
Access policy:
: Parking will be at Mike Newsome's house (the Bat Ranch). Please do not park in front of the
covered bridge or beside the road.
Group size will be limited to a total of 12 persons.
• No more than two simultaneous groups will be allowed.
A maximum of 5 trips will be permitted per week.
Each caye explorer must have a helmet mounted light.
• Avalid drivers license shall be requird in exchange for each key. Lost key replacement is $20.
• Keys will not be issued to minors.
Copying of keys is prohibited. You must always check out a key to enter the caye.
Groups should plan access arrangements in advance if possible to avoid disappointment or
conflicts. Mike can be contacted at (540)626-3386 between the hours of 10am-7pm.
The granting of access by Mike Newsome or the Link family is not an endorsement of a group
or any cave explorers ability. They are not responsible for cave explorers safety and are not a
sign out.
The Link family and Mike Newsome reserve the right to deny or grant access to anyone, for
any reason or no reason at all. The cave is on private property and visitors are guests.

locked after they leave the cave.
Alcohol or other drugs do not mix with caving. Possession of alcohol or drugs on the Link's

This cave is protected by Virginia State Law (Code of Virginia 10.1-1000 et. seq.).
