The National Speleological Society (NSS) Conservation Policy:
Caves have unique scientific, recreational, and scenic values
These values are endangered by both carelessness and intentional vandalism
• These values, once gone, cannot be recovered
• The responsibility for protecting caves must be formed by those who study and enjoy them.
Accordingly, the intention of the Society is to work for the preservation of caves with a realistic policy supported by
effective programs for: the encouragement of self-discipline among cavers; education and research concerning the
causes and prevention of cave damage; and special projects, including cooperation with other groups similarly
dedicated to the conservation of natural areas. Specifically:
All contents of a cave — formations, life, and loose deposits — are significant for their enjoyment and
interpretation. Therefore, caving parties should leave a cave as they find it. They should provide means for the
removal of waste; limit marking to a few, small, and removable signs as are needed for surveys; and, especially,
exercise extreme care not to accidentally break or soil formations, disturb life forms or unnecessarily increase the
number of disfiguring paths through an area.
Scientific collection is professional, selective, and minimal. The collecting of mineral or biological material
for display purposes, including previously broken or dead specimens, is never justified, as it encourages others to
collect and destroy the interest of the cave.
The Society encourages projects such as:
Establishing cave preserves
Placing entrance gates where appropriate
Opposing the sale of speleothems
Supporting effective protective measures
Cleaning and restoring over-used caves
Cooperating with private cave owners by providing them knowledge about their cave and assisting them in
protecting their cave and property from damage during cave visits
Encouraging commercial cave owners to make use of their opportunity to aid the public in understanding
caves and the importance of their conservation.
Where there is reason to believe that publication of cave locations will lead to vandalism before adequate protection
can be established, the Society will oppose such publication.
