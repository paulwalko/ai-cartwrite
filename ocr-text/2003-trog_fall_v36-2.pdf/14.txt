Monday, 01/05/04. (Originator of listserv flurry) Tawneys Gate Question: If you have visited Tawneys Caye
since the gate was installed, please comment on the ease/difficulty of unlocking, opening, and relocking
the gate, especially from the inside. Grapevine says it is a pain in the ass...I am curious what the
consensus is.
Saturday, 01/10/04. 2:58pm. Re: Tawneys Gate Question: Tawneys gate sucks big time. It is dangerous,
ludicrous, and reflects very poorly on the club. It is the most poorly designed cave gate I have ever
encountered. Whoever designed and approved the design should be stationed at the gate 24/7/365 to
operate the locks and move the access bar for cavers who visit.
1. The gate has two locks: (A cave with one ungated entrance has a gate with two locks?!)
2. The size of the cages around the locks allows only small, flexible hands to enter and maneuver the
locks. Did the designer intend for every caving team to include a fairy or a garden gnome?
3. The size of the cages around the lock will not allow the lock with the key in place to be pivoted into
the horizontal position necessary to disengage the lock from the gate's hasp.
4. The metal bar that must be lifted and moved out of position to create a slot through which a cayer
must slide must weigh 50 pounds. The garden gnomes on the trip will need to bring along
some orks just to lift the bar. Removing and replacing the bar is a difficult maneuver from
outside the cave, and a worse one while crouched on that little platform just inside the gate.
5. If it is pivoted in the least, the removable bar in the gate easily and quickly jams in the space
between other bars that has been reduced in size by welding.
I think fair estimate is that it took us a half an hour to get through the gate and nearly as long to get
back out. Our exit time was faster because we didn't lock the second lock. We even debated throwing
it into the creek outside. Cave management need not be such a display of machismo at the expense of
reasonable access.
Saturday, 01/10/04.4:01pm. Tawneys trip tonight(Sat) tomorrow(sun): In light of the recent comment about
the new gate, I am curious to try it. And if I am going to spend a great deal of time (based on what I
have heard) opening the gate, then I want to bebop around in tawneys some. Based on the description,
[it] sounds like I might need a hobbit and an orca.
Saturday, 01/10/04. 4:31 pm. Re: Tawneys Gate Question: I realize the gate may be a real pain in the ass, but I
would just like to ask one simple question: how many people that knew about gate installation, design
and use, offered any help at all when we were talking about needing a gate (by land owners request)
for Tawneys?
Saturday, 01/10/04. 6:23pm. Re: Gate: I couldn't agree more. One of the big problems in this group is the
difficulty in getting timely volunteer opinion, help and input. Most of the time, the Grotto as a whole
refuses to volunteer time or input, and then bitches about the end product. It's reminiscent of a Dilbert
cartoon. I didn't help, and I haven't seen the gate, but as far as I'm concerned, Steve, and the few
other volunteers that offered to (including Walt) or did help performed a great service to the Grotto,
and the caving community in general by doing what the LANDOWNER REQUIRED TO KEEP
TAWNEYS OPEN.
I've heard it time and again, from many different folks. Those who volunteer, it seems, are doomed to
be bitched at by those who don't. Don't get me wrong, I've done my share of both, and I know you've
