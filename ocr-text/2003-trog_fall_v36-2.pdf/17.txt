Up, Up, Up with a Steve
(or rather, the risks of climbing, motorcycles, explosives, and all
manner of Steve-ish activities)

Of all the Steves that ever flew
(and flying Steves are rather few
(for to fly you ought
(whether you are a Steve or not)
to have some wings (yes, at least two
(at least, no less than two will do
(and Steves have something less than one..
(one less in fact, (or, frankly, none,
Which (as you will agree).
Limits the flying of a Steve))))))).
(I further make the point that Steves
are prone to test hypotheses
(an observation (you'll agree)
both apt and pleasing to a Steve)).
And let me add that Steves that fly
Are known as broken (You can see why.)
All I have said thus far is true.
(If it's not clear, that's up to you..
(You'll have to learn when a Steve is near
That what is true may not be clear.
(While what is clear may not be true
(And you'll be wiser when you do)))).
Fatal Accident in Lori Cori Canyon Cave
This is a collaborative account by members of the group. Distribute as appropriate. Reprinted from listserv posting.
On Saturday September 27, 2003 a crew consisting of Mike Ficco, Andrea Futrell, Mike Futrell, Dick
Graham, Sue Setzler, Ron Simmons, and Steve Wells entered Lori Cori Canyon Cave in Wise County
Virginia. A routine survey trip had been planned.
Everything proceeded normally as the group climbed down the entrance, and then crawled, climbed
and chimneyed down to the 90-foot pit. A nuisance drop of about 20-feet quickly follows the 90-foot
pit and begins a challenging section of tall narrow winding canyon where one straddles and chimneys
midway on slimy little ledges above a narrowing crack that in many places prevents one from
accessing the “floor’ that is 20-feet below. This canyon looses 60-feet of elevation in a little over 300
feet of distance.
The canyon abruptly widens about 40-feet before a large dome-pit. Here there is a traverse line along
the wall that allows one to cross a greasy sloping shelf, as the bottom of the canyon and its little
stream are still dropping away below. In about 25 feet the traverse line meets another rope that
provides an 18-foot rappel to another traverse line. This second traverse line extends 20-feet out
16.
