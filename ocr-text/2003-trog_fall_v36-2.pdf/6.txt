Ferguson and Ray Sira both finding little holes in the ground worth noting, but barely.
After salivating over Fletch for half an hour or so, we started to trudge back to the cars to
return home. For no reason other than not be part of the herd, I traversed down the line ·
of sinks progressing from Fletch Hole rather than walk along the 'road'. Then I noticed a
hole underneath a rosebush and cherry tree. It didn't look promising. It didn't look much
different than the things Ray and Craig had found in April. However, it's everyone's
compulsion to look into holes promising or not.
Crouching down to a deep duck walk, I endured the rosebush enough to look down the
hole. It was about the size of a manhole and six feet deep with sheer sides. The first
thing you notice was that the air was cool. Not just hole in the ground cool, but cave
cool. It just smelled like a cave.
Calling up the hill to Philip, I thought everyone might like to have a look at this thing.
This was the point where Philip had finally been infected by the demotivation bug
(leaving only Rob). However... holes like this are a compulsion and they started to
trudge away from the beer in order to stick their head down it too.
So we all peer down this thing. We all note the coolness of the air. We all note that
Philip has gotten far more excited than I've seen him since he set Chris' ceiling on fire,
and he jumps down the hole. Then rocks start exiting the hole. Then two Photons enter
the hole. Then the kind of grunts and moans that make you worry for Sandy exit the
hole. Next, the type of howl of triumph that make you really worry for Sandy emanated
from the hole.
Unfortunately, it choked off immediately to a dig... but a blowing dig. .
On the way back to the cars, Spot asked what the name should be. In the random access ·
that makes you worry for Penelope, I just said "Rose Petal Snowflake". Energized, we
returned home and ate our steaks.
Dig trips:
Sunday, Sept 14. The day after its discovery, Spot and Philip returned to clear the
entrance of poison ivy and groom the rosebush for easier access.
Tuesday, Sept 16. Kevin Rock, Tom Mallibad, Philip Balister, and Mark Eisenbies enter
the historical section dig into the new section. This managed to more than double the
length of the cave and left us with two blowing leads. The crew also took the opportunity
to survey the cave (~40 feet) (Figure 2).
Saturday, Sept 20. Large VPI crew dug directly into the 'solution tube' in hopes for a...
cheap victory.
