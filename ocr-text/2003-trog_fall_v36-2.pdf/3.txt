project benefits cave
conservation and karst

such a Nellies Cave is
Trashed pulled out of Nellies Cave
aesthetically unpleasing, but
it can also lead to groundwater pollution and be a safety issue for
people visiting the cave.

This cave conservation project was supported by the Montgomery
County, Virginia Public Service Authority. A role-off dumpster was.
provided by the county. Over a dozen old car tires along with bed
frames, small engines and metal canisters were among the items
hauled from the cave. The Nellies Cave Clean-out was registered
with the Stewardship Virginia Campaign, a six-week, statewide
initiative to help citizens with projects that enhance and conserve
Virginia's natural and cultural resources.
Mythos of the “Terrible Tunnel”
by Aaron Thomas
The excitement of uncharted depth and darkness is something that is alluring to first time
cayers. The uncertainty breeds adventure, adrenaline, and a thirst for more. However, if you have ever
found yourself alone, waiting for your turn to ascend the vertical highway, to be reunited with friends,
light, and safety; a cave can be an eerie place. Your senses are heightened, as is your imagination.
Each water droplet becomes a footstep, any air movement becomes a breath, and just as you clear the
ground you can almost hear a hideous, starving monstrosity scouring the ground in frustration
because it narrowly missed its dinner.
Of course, these feelings soon abate as you are on your way topside; your rational mind
regains control. But what if it was not your imagination? What if you were a second late clearing the
ground, if you came face to face with a ravenous creature never before identified and possessing a
metabolism slow enough to allow it to go decades between feedings? Your rational mind tells you no,
but what if you came face to face with the “Terrible Tunnel?”
I think we have all had this feeling, as fleeting or insignificant as it may have been. But of
course, I also tend to think most cayers who were children in the 80s were also fans of Fraggle Rock
without ever realizing where their curiosity would lead them. In commemoration of Fraggle Rock’s.
20th year anniversary, I wanted to draw attention to Jim Henson's take of the “Terrible Tunnel” myth.
