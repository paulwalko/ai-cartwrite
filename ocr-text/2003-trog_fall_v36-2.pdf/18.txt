along a greasy sloping shelf to the primary rigging for a 213-foot drop. The rig points are bolts; the
rope is 11mm PMI. At the top of the 213ft one would be cow-tailed to the traverse line while standing
or kneeling on a very slick sloping shelf approximately four feet wide. A heavy pad is on the lip. From
that point the rope hangs free to the bottom. For the upper few dozen feet the rope hangs inches away
from the wall gradually increasing to several feet. By midway down the drop the wall is 8 to 10 feet
away. Here a flowstone shelf rolls out and comes within 2-inches of the free-hanging rope. Below the
flowstone are some nice draperies and the wall gradually recedes again to about 10-feet away at the
bottom.
Communication up and down the big pit is very difficult due to the acoustics and small waterfall. It
would take a concerted effort by both parties for a person at the bottom of the 18ft to clearly see the
gear of a person at the lip of the 213ft
Several points along the traverse lines allow room to sit and wait. Available space and safety concerns
necessitate spreading out along this area while waiting. Andrea was in the lead and was first down the
pit. Dick was second in line. Mike Ficco joined Dick at the bottom of the 18ft. Dick began his rappel
in a normal fashion and Ficco watched the reflected light from his lamp begin to fade as he descended.
Mike estimates that Dick had rappelled 20-30 feet, after which he heard Dick say, "No, No!”. This
was immediately followed by a very loud “Boom, BOOM,” which was heard by all, presumably a
result of Dick first hitting the flowstone shelf followed by the floor of the shaft. Instantly, Andrea
began yelling for Dick as she raced down and over from the waiting alcove about 100-feet distant.
Andrea found Dick about 25-feet away from the bottom of the rope and completely detached. With
great difficulty she communicated that Dick was dead and that someone else should come down,
carefully observing the rope and ledge. Ficco was ready and descended next. He confirmed Andrea's
observations. Dick's bobbin (simple) was open and his gear appeared normal. Andrea and Ficco did
not observe any evidence of rock fall.
The group left the cave in a state of utter shock and disbelief. A raging thunderstorm accompanied
them on the hike back up the mountain.
At this point the cause of the accident is unknown. The police are developing pictures from the scene
and from the medical examiner. Any hypotheses are strictly speculation, and it is possible that
experienced, competent and safety-conscious caver. Please be considerate of the impact on his friends
and family and refrain from public speculation until more is known.
A Great Deal of Credit and a Very Big Thank You are extended to:-The Wise County Sheriffs Office
for doing everything they could to accommodate the needs and desires of the crew and recovery
personnel. -Triangle Rescue for providing equipment, key personnel and for facilitating the correct
amount at the correct time'. -All the people that dropped everything, cancelled work and lost sleep to
assist in a very stressful and emotional situation.
Whether in the caye, on the surface, or hundreds of miles away, the collective efforts of these
individuals and organizations, brought about what was the smoothest cave rescue/recovery incident
that most of us have ever witnessed. We are very grateful. Thank you all.
