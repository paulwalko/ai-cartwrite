The Ballad of Sir Blunderbrain
by Dennis Lee
Come gather round you Fraggle clan and hear the tale I tell,
About a grand disaster and a wicked magic spell,
About a Fraggle's bravery, about a Fraggle's brain,
About a mighty knight in arms, the bold Sir Blunderbrain,
About the tunnel back from which he never came again,
About the tunnel back from which he never came again.
A thousand years ago or maybe even thirty-three,
The ancient Fraggles wrestled with a strange catastrophe.
Every time they wandered down a certain tunnel lane; .
One by one they disappeared like bubbles down a drain
The darkness closed around them and they never came again...
A darkness closed around them and they never came again.
Sir Blunderbrain went bravely to the entrance of the tunnel.
The wind was low and lonesome and it wasn't any, uħ, funnel.
And then he heard the spirits who cried their sad refrain.
It was all the Fraggles who had gone and never come again.
Yes, all the Fraggles who had gone and never come again.
Sir Blunderbrain he drew his sword and took a mighty swing.
The tunnel drew a sword as well and swung right back again.
And so for hours they battled, they fought with might and mane...
And all the while the tunnel cried, "You'll not go home again!".
Yes, all the while the tunnel cried, "You'll not go home again!”
At last Sir Blunderbrain he brought that tunnel to it's knees.
He cried, "Give me my Fraggles or I'll slice you up like cheese!".
And so the tunnel coughed them up, they all went home again.
Except our mighty hero, the brave Sir Blunderbrain,
For the tunnel sucked him under and he never came again,
The brave Sir Blunder stumbled and he never camë again.
Oh, all ye Fraggles blubber for he'll not come home again.
Reprise:
Come gather 'round you Fraggle clan and hear the tale I tell,
About a mighty triumph and the one who broke the spell.
The tunnel nearly slew him as it slew Sir Blunderbrain.
He trembled and he wembled as he walked in paths of pain.
His wine-dark muscles faltered as he fought with might and mane,
But then he heard my story with it's echoing refrain.
A bolt of strength renewed him and he burst right through his chains,
And he gathered up the prisoners and he brought them home again.
Yes, he gathered up the prisoners and he brought them home again.
