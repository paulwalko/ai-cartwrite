First Roy and some caver helpers placed a large (4' x 8') sheet of steel mesh on the floor of the
entrance to serve as the bottom of the gated area; Roy cut the edges to make a better fit. This will.
prevent gate vandals from digging below the gate to gain access. Then Roy determined the lengths of
steel needed for the actual barrier bars and support structure, and Charlie fired up the torch.
As Charlie cut the steel, glowing sparks attacked everyone and everything nearby. When a newly cut
piece fell to the ground, someone grabbed it and placed the hot end into a bucket of water to speed up
the cooling process. Steam rose as the water hissed from the intense heat.
Adam used the arc welder to attach one bar of steel to
the mesh reaching from one side of the entrance to the
other – the foundation of the gate. Then he angled
pieces towards the ceiling to form the outer edges, and
one piece ran straight up from the bottom center to the
ceiling. Charlie cut hangers (3.5-inch pieces cut from
6-inch angled steel) to hold the horizontal bars while
Roy measured the distance between each row of
hangers using a tool he created specifically for the job.
The distance between bars is crucial to allow bats to
fly in and out unimpeded yet prevent skinny
trespassers from slipping through. Cavers clamped the
hangers into place for Adam to weld them. I was able
to help Kevin Rock place a few of the hangers thanks
to being small enough to shove into a tight corner.

Welding Tawney's Gate
And so we settled into a system. Roy measured and supervised, Charlie cut, cavers passed in the steel,
cavers clamped steel in place, and Adam welded. Dan and Marian McConnell stopped by to check out
the progress, and Dan took a several-hour turn cutting the steel. With each shower of sparks from the
torch and each flickering glare of the arc welder, the gate took shape.
Once Adam welded the hangers into position, we placed the horizontal bars. We built each horizontal
bar from 4-inch angled steel arranged with the apex pointing up, with 1.5-inch angled pieces welded
inside with their “L” shapes back-to-back to form a flat bottom. The inside pieces act as stabilizers to
strengthen the bars.
Before we secured the highest bar, we needed to remove a pesky section of the ceiling. Kevin Rock
and Travis Coad each spent time using a hammer drill to make the "adjustment;" the task looked tiring
but fun. I wanted to take a turn, but I reined in my request because it required more muscle and I
didn't want to waste anyone's time.
With the horizontal bars welded in place, the gate looked nearly complete, but not so. We still needed
to add the key-lock access and connect the steel to the cave ceiling and walls. The actual locked
pieces used flat steel with holes torched into it; more flat pieces surrounded the lock area to protect
someone from simply breaking or cutting the lock. As for securing the gate to the actual rock of the
cave, Charlie cut 6-inch sections of round steel to act as pins. A drill-wielding cayer opened holes in
