done a great deal for the Grotto and for caving. But as a Grotto, we, myself included, can do a better
job of helping the officers and committee chairs by volunteering our time and knowledge in a timely
manner.
None of this means that the comments aren't unfounded. I've heard the gate is pretty difficult to use.
Nevertheless, it is still easier to gain access to Tawneys through the gate the dedicated volunteers
installed than it would be if they hadn't put it there. The owners of the gated entrance said they would
BLAST IT CLOSED if it wasn't gated.
Sunday, 01/11/04. 2:23am. Re: Tawneys Gate Question: The gate was installed to reduce traffic into Tawneys.
Most of you were not here this summer when there was literately 5+yans and a bus load parked
outside the cave EVERY SINGLE DAY! That is no exaggeration, there were over 5 camps using the
cave DAILY. Over 250 less-than-responsible people passing thru Tawneys weekly. Since the gate was
installed, there has been no stray cars parked on the road.
The people from responsible groups have made no complaints about the gate. I like to think it is
because they are just happy enough to be able use that special caye. Maybe I'm bias because I was
there for the gating and have been in the cave over hundred times. I have pulled out whole coolers of
beer, been in there w/ sorostitutes screaming at hibernating bats, and removed string from the entire
caye (someone strung the whole cave like bread crumbs). I like the idea that the gate is a pain in the
a@@. We have other caves and before Tawneys was closed, everyone was saying how boring it was.
Monday, 01/12/04. 8:56am. Re: Tawneys Gate Question: The gate is not finished. When weather warms up
enough to work on the gate again, we plan to finish the concrete and other things around the main
entrance and repair a sinall problem with the fat-mans gate. This work will require a welder and
probably other “heavy” tools. It is likely the operation of the gate can be made smoother at that time.
It will certainly be our intent to improve the situation at that time.
However, the caye was closed to all. Now it is not. If it's too difficult for you to go in, then, uh, too
bad. Lots of caves are too difficult for just anyone to enjoy. IfTAWNEYS is now beyond the ability
of some of us, such is life.
Monday, 01/12/04. 9:05am. Re: Tawneys Gate Question: Sorry to reply to my own post; while the above was
meant to be in part a jab, I want to be sure my meaning is clear. When you carry a rope for hours
halfway up a mountain to a cave, that is part of the trip even though it isn't caving per se. Think of the
Tawneys gate this way - it is now part of the trip. Be careful, take your time, and enjoy the _whole
trip.
Hopefully the issues raised can be addressed and the situation improved, however, it is not easy. Cave
gates are not bought at Sears; everyone did the best they could under the circumstances, and we are all
committed to the land owner and the club to make the gate as good as we can. Please be patient and
constructive, not destructive.
Monday, 01/12/04. 11:36am. Re: Tawneys Gate - goals & a concern: A primary goal of constructing a cave
gate is to make it *DAMN DIFFICULT* to access the lock (and sometimes the gate itself), thus
significantly hindering anyone from picking, cutting, torching, etc.
Thank You! to the folks who worked on the project for ensuring that it is indeed a gate, not a
barricade, and for negotiating a copy of the key. Mil Gracias!
Now, a real concern: Which, yes which, cave is going to take Tawneys' (and New River's (as most of
its traffic went to Tawneys)) place among the unwashed hordes?
