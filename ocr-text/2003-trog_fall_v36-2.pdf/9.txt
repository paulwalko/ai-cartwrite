Two Days, Two Gates
by Eileen O'Malley
.
Most of us never expected to see one of our local favorite caves blocked by formidable piles of steel.
However due to years of disrespectful spelunkers vandalizing the landowners' property, they decided
that gating the Tawneys road entrances made an attractive solution. So on November 15 and 16,
2003, a large group from VPI Cave Club and several folks from Blue Ridge and New River Grottos
gathered on Zells Mill Road to fulfill the landowner request.
The organization began months in advance when Steve Wells contacted Roy Powers, a well-known
specialist who has gated hundreds of caves. Steve had recently seen Roy's work at Greenville
Saltpeter Cave in West Virginia. Over the course of many phone calls and faxes, Steve provided a
rough sketch of the two entrances and Roy provided a list of materials he would need for both gates.
Also, Roy's regular welder could not make the trip; Steve needed to find a replacement welder.
One evening at the London Underground, as Steve wondered if he'd find a welder in time, he met up
with Charlie Maus. Charlie had recently completed a welding class and recommended Adam Mount, a
classmate, for the job. Charlie volunteered himself to spend the weekend cutting the steel, and we
ended up paying Adam $300.00 for the weekend.
The gating activity actually began on Friday. Due to some miscommunication, the steel company
could not deliver the steel on time; we had to send some cayers to Lynchburg to retrieve it. Steve
LePera, Mike Cole, and Sandy Ramsey made the trip and acquired $866.00 of steel – ask LePera
about driving Ray Sira's van in the dark without headlights. Despite his reputation as a Bastard, Wil
Orndorff also contributed; he picked up and later returned the canisters of gas needed for the torches
(an expense of $55.00).
Saturday's project, the larger of the two entrances, began at 8:00 a.m. in the Bat Ranch driveway
where cayers met in the rain (naturally) to get ourselves and the gear organized. Roy came prepared
with welding torches, a generator, extension cords, and all the other tools needed for the job. We
parked his red truck on the road by the entrance and placed orange “road work” cones along the road.
Thanks to continuous morning drizzle, the path to the Tawneys entrance presented a slippery, muddy.
challenge. One manly crew struggled to bring gas canisters up the slimy slope and then roped them to
trees; the rest of us carried smaller, lighter gear up to the entrance.
Then came the steel. We had purchased angled, flat, and round steel in various sizes in 10-foot
lengths, and the biggest piece of 6-inch angled weighed a hefty 150 pounds. Given the slippery
conditions, we decided to pass the steel up the slopes similar to passing a litter in a caye rescue.
Stationed near the top of the slope, I glanced down to see a string of females lining the route – the big
beefy men gathered at the böttom chatting! Though I don't doubt the strength and toughness of caver
women, I noticed smiles of relief when a few strong men noticed the discrepancy and weaved their
way up through the line.
Like many others I didn't want to see the cave gated, yet the actual gate-building process fascinated
me. I tried to stay involved near the entrance so I could see as much as possible. Most of the time I'..
probably just got in the way; luckily Roy didn't seem to mind me or my pesky questions.
