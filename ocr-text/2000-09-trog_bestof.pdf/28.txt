Elvis Grotto: The Twilight Zone of Caving
By Rob Story
In the rolling hills of Giles County, amidst farmland and horses (I will get to them later), there
lies a cave which defies the normal rules of caving. Elvis Grotto #1 looks fairly innocuous at first; it's
just another hole in the ground in a state filled with much of the same. But this cave isn't like the
others.... This cave is jinxed.
My first experience with Elvis Grotto really wasn't my idca. Philip Balister came to me one
night with a gleam in his eye that I should have, and now know, to fear. He told me that Dave
Colatosti and Kevin Rock were going to do some surveying in Elvis Grotto in hopes of getting to and
drilling the bolts for a "promising‚Äù forty foot virgin pit and they needed another person for the trip. I,
not having been there before, was mildly excited at the thought of getting to see a new cave as well as
possibly dropping the pit. We set out the next morning.
For those who have never been there before, Elvis Grotto is almost inexplicably covered with
mud. No matter how hard you try, you will be slimed when you exit the cave. It's just that kind of
place. By the time Dave, Kevin, and I got to the lead, we were already decently covered with mud,
having gone through the two rebelays and down mud covered ropes. What I didn't realize is what
surveying the lead entailed. Basically, the hole drains the water that is dropping from the 100 foot pit.
The mud in the tube has the consistency of peanut butter and is probably anywhere from three to six
inches thick. I got appointed the job of lead tape, having never read instruments or drawn before, so I
started my way down the hole. After setting up my first station (a mound of mud, incidentally), I was
already completely slimed. I took a good bit of time to set up, so I probably laid in the same place for
30 minutes or longer. I remember that when I moved to the second station, Kevin took my place and
commented on how I had warmed up the mud for him. My, what a generous caver I am.
After we had surveyed around 70 feet or so to the virgin pit, Kevin and I were downright
cold, myself probably more so than Kevin. Dave set the bolts and grudgingly admitted that we should
probably get out there, given our rather chilled and ridiculously muddy condition. I could tell that he
really wanted to drop the pit, but to his credit he let us leave so that we could warm up. One muddy
hole, three ropes, and about two hours later, we sat just inside the entrance. We knew this was going
to be the worst part... it couldn't have been more than ten or fifteen degrees outside, and we were
absolutely soaked through. We untied our boots and took off our vertical gear, which in retrospect
was a very good idea. By the time I got back to the car, most things attached to my body were
frozen. My gloves were frozen to my fingers, my helmet latch was frozen shut, and my boots were
almost frozen to my feet. It was cold. Really...damn...cold.
After rapidly stripping and getting into a semi-warm car, we headed back on our way to
Blacksburg, us looking like grotesque creatures with our faces and hair covered in mud. Here is
where the first jinxed event occurred. Driving back from Elvis Grotto involves going through three
gates, all of which need to be carefully shut and locked to prevent the escape of horses. I really don't
know how I managed to mess this up. I was sure that I looped all of the chains the way I found
them...but I guess I wasn't as sure as I thought. At the next Cave Club meeting Carrie Blankenship,
whose family owns the land, cheerfully comes up and tells me that I let most of her family's horses
out. This is after Dave, Kevin, and I had already let one escape in our journey to the cave. I
apologized profusely and was relieved to hear that they thought it was rather humorous. Rather
humorous indeed, I know what happened...I was jinxed by Elvis Grotto.
In my next cave trip after that fateful night, a trip to Link's cave, I truly realized what an
enigma Elvis Grotto is. I didn't manage to clean my gear after that first trip, with the exception of all
of my vertical equipment. Therefore, the rest of my stuff was absolutely crusted with mud. I literally
