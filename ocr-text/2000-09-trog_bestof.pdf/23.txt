radio gear. Philip sucks as does his cursed radio
equipment!
We left the radio on for thirty minutes while
looking around the room. Kevin spotted some
hay in the puddles and looked around for some
daylight. It is so close to the surface, but it just
will not open a second entrance for us. I blame
Philip
Getting down the breakdown was much easier
than getting up, let me tell you. All you had to do
was position yourself just right and make sure.
you did not slide too far too fast. As we were
climbing up the free climb above the
Plinkerboing, Kevin noted a large crash and lots
of rolling noises from the breakdown area.
Apparently something big had fallen in the
breakdown area not too long after we had left.
Damn Philip and his radio antenna.
We made it out after around eleven hours
underground. None of us were all that lively, but
we all made it out under our own power.
Unfortunately, the radio equipment made it out as
well. We had seriously contemplated leaving it in
there for Philip to take out, but we knew that he
would just make us get it. Talking with Philip
later he seemed quite happy with the points we
set and it was a successful trip above ground as
well. The only bad aspect was he was happy that
the equipment was in as good a shape as it was.
We tried really hard to break it because Philip
sucks, but I guess we failed in that respect.
The next day Kevin, Philip and I started talking
about taking another trip to the back to mark the
"fingers‚Äù of Lost Promise. Sick, sick, sick.
As we headed back into the crawl, Kathy had the
unenviable job of fixing the radio antenna every
time it got stuck. Look at the map the
Pennsylvania Borehole it quite twisty. The stupid
thing got stuck every few feet. I bet Kathy
regretted the decision to follow me almost
immediately because dealing with that antenna
sucked almost as much as Philip does. I tried my
best to splinter that thing, but Wells made it too
well. He earned many curses back there as well.
As I went through this funky downward pinch
just past the Pennsylvania Borehole, Kathy called
up to me to tell me one of my steel toes fell out.
Woohoo! My boots finally died and it was an
honorable death! I made them carry my steel toe
up to me as the antenna was stuck behind me and
there was no hope of me freeing it by myself. I
still have my steel toe in my cave gear as an odd
trophy.
It was about seven or eight hours into the trip at
that point and everyone was starting to get worn
down. We redistributed the gear to the pack
mules (why do you think we invited Kathy and
Kara anyway?) and split up to save time. Kevin
and Kara crawled ahead to the 30ft drop while
Kathy and I took our time wrestling with the
