On Saturday, September 22, 2001, members of
the VPI Cave Club along with personnel from
the Giles County Public Service Authority and
the Virginia Department of Conservation and
Recreation Division of Natural Heritage
cleaned out a sinkhole located on property
owned by the Kenneth Neel family.
The sinkhole was used as a dump by previous
landowners for many years. Former occupants
of a house trailer located next to the sinkhole
almost certainly "straight piped" their sewage
and wastewater to the sinkhole and into the
karst aquifer below. Cleaning the trash from
the sinkhole will serve to improve the
groundwater quality for many of the area's
residents who depend on springs or wells for
their domestic water supply. It is possible the
drainage from the sinkhole on the Neel
property makes up part of the calcium
carbonate-rich water flow emerging from a
spring on Sinking Creek known for its
travertine deposits. It was hoped excavation
work performed to remove debris from the site
would uncover a cave entrance, but no opening
was found.

Twenty-five VPI cavers provided considerable
help in moving equipment and sorting
recyclable material. In all, three “roll off”
boxes full of material were removed from the
sinkhole along with the old mobile home. Jay
Williams, Vice Chairman of the Giles County
Board of Supervisors, attended the clean-up to
personally express the gratitude of the board
for the cooperation and work by the Cave Club
on this worthwhile karst protection project.

The bulk of the debris removal was performed
by a backhoe provided by the citizens of Giles
County. A grant from the Cave Conservancy of
the Virginias provided funds for removal and
proper disposal of the sinkhole debris at the
regional landfill as well as purchase of erosion
