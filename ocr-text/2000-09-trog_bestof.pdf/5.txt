Why can't FEMALE nerd cavers burn their

Polish cavers are much better than Polish
rope.
We dug and found mud!! I mean we didn't
find anything. Yeah. Stay away from our mud

If you go that way, you probably won't even
break your leg.
No fair padding your in-cave time by taking an

chased.
A real cave trip.
