the rock and placed the pins through the hole of a flat
piece; Adam welded the pin to the flat piece and the
flat piece to the sides of the gate.
We still had a gap underneath the mesh floor, but we
intended to roll some big rocks into the opening on
Sunday as a temporary measure. The long-term plan,
by now completed, involved filling the opening with
concrete. Roy tries to avoid using concrete whenever
possible, but in this case it seemed the best solution.

Finally we declared the formidable gate measuring
approximately 10' x 5' complete. By this time the sun
Lepera drilling inside the gate
had gone down and we brought the equipment carefully down the slope and into Roy's vehicle and
lock-box. We guided our way with headlamps borrowed from the Bat Ranch; many of the cavers on
hand (myself including) had forgotten to bring their own! The gas canisters spent the night on the hill
between the entrances concealed with leaves and debris.
On Sunday morning we met again, but with a much smaller crew. We simply had no need for crowds
since we moved most of the heavy steel up to the second entrance the day before. Good thing, given
the lack of stable, flat places to stand. We repeated the process of Roy measuring, Charlie cutting, and
Adam welding, yet we completed this gate more quickly because of the much smaller entrance
(approximately 3' x 4'). We even had enough spare time and cavers to fill the previous day's gap with
rocks as planned. Roy began his four-hour drive home by 3:00 p.m.
All told, gating both Tawneys road entrances cost around $1500 which we covered with generous
donations. We spent a very full weekend hard at work. Thanks to everyone who showed up to help,
we honored the landowners' wish to control access into the cave. With the approval of the Link
family, we created an official access policy which folks at the Bat Ranch will maintain. Please spread
the word to everyone you know who frequents the cave.
