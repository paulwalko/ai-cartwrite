came out of Link's cleaner than I went in. I can't think of many other caves that will cause you to
come out of a cave looking better than when you started. That's Elvis Grotto for you.
Even after all of this, I volunteered to go back a couple weeks later, under the promise that I
wouldn't have to crawl down that absolutely nasty hole that I did the first time. Philip, Steve Wells,
Chris Garguilo, and I went back to survey a promising high lead that would go over the nasty crawl.
We got to the lead and Steve commenced knocking loads of rock off of the wall, both with his
hammer and with his explosives. Philip and Chris surveyed the small bit of new passage and then we
waited for Steve to finish his bolting. That is when Elvis Grotto struck again. Half a bolt-hole away
from our virgin pit, the drill quit. We didn't panic...after all, we had another battery. But of course,
that battery didn't work either. I'm not sure who got blamed for the battery failure in the end; I was
probably the culprit, having dragged the batteries through the water in that nasty hole on my first trip.
We all cursed and moaned the battery packs and headed back out into what was thankfully a beautiful
day. Elvis Grotto had struck a second time.
I'm not really sure if there were any more incidents worth noting after that. I do know that
according to Wells, the 40 foot virgin pit that Philip had high hopes for pretty much did nothing.
From what I understand, there is a good bit of water going down it that funnels into a small hole. The
dye tracing done gives us good hope for a big cave in the area, so I am sure that there will be more
trips into the cave to search for new leads. However, I am warning those who go to Elvis
Grotto...the cave is jinxed... it is the Twilight Zone of caving.
