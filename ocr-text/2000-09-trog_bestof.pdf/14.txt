At Bridge Day, I found that my second bar
would jam tightly against my spacers and it
took a great deal of hand strength to move the
bar even to the point where force-feeding rope
allowed my descent. On my second rappel I
switched to a 4.5 bar configuration (braking
hand on the same side as the face of the last
engaged bar), and the rappel was more
acceptable, but not ideal.
Just after Bridge Day, I installed a stainless
steel hose clamp within my SMC U bar in the
second position (see Figure 2). Cut off the
excess band and file smooth. Because it fixes
the second bar in position, the bar had to be
filed into a strait-groove, idiot bar to allow the
bar to be opened for rigging. My initial spacing
between the first two bars was set at 0.7 inches,
and the maximum spacing I have used in
practice has been no more than 1.1 inches. I
currently have it set for approximately 0.9
inches.
Since installation, five-bar rappels have been
my standard even on dirty ropes, and I have
still not required the use of a sixth bar. Thus, I
have found this modification to improve the
overall performance of my rappel rack. There
have been no problems with slippage or creep
of the hose clamp, and I have not had to adjust
its position after setting it. .
Berause the second har is fixed friction can
only be controlled by bars three through six.
Despite this minor inconvenience the
modification allows a precise setting, as well as
the ability to tweak it. Since my hand can only
manipulate three bars at once anyhow, I do not
find this particular disadvantage all that
problematic.
In conclusion, despite what Smith and Padgett
happen to say in favor or against the use of
spacers, I have found this addition to be useful
in providing myself smoother rappels.
Furthermore, the option of fine-tuning the
spacing to provide the exact friction I desire is
a definite advantage. Now that I've found a
balance that suits me, I have not had the need
to change my spacing of 0.9 inches. Because of
its adjustability, this method of bar spacing
probably has promise for owners of long racks.
