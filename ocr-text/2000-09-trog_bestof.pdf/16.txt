The following is an explanation or equation for
the time expected to pass between the
predetermined sign-out and before arriving at
the cave, where T is the expected time of arrival
at the cave. The other variables involved are: S,
Start Time; C, Number of Cavers on trip; F(S),
Food time as a function of Start Time; and W,
the number of Wheeled Vehicles to be
negotiated towards the cave. An example is
threaded throughout this explanation of T to
hasten understanding.
With the intended Start Time, S, and the
Number of Cavers, C, you can begin setting up
an equation for time, T, in hours, where C is
multiplied by 8/60 for the average of eight
minutes each caver will delay the trip either at
sign-out or getting to sign-out and T is the sum
of all the factors.
T= S+C*(8/60)
If the Start Time, S, was set for 8 A.M. and the
Number of Cavers, C, was 4, the initial delayed
Time is:
T=8+4(8/60) or T=8.5333 A.M.
Into this equation, one needs to account for
time of day, in relation to the natural feeding
times of cavers, F(S). Starting a trip near a peak
feeding hour will delay a trip up to an hour
because cavers will not move unless fed. Peak
feeding hours are usually midnight, 7 A.M.,
noon, and 7 P.M. (Cavers will eat if given an
opportunity. Do not let that happen!) F(S) can
be modeled by a cosine function, where times
are transformed into radians (the origin is
valued as 21.00 or 9 P.M. and an hour has the
value of pi/12). To change the Start Time into
radians, one must take the find the number of
hours passed since 9 P.M. and multiply it by pi/
12.
F(S) - abs (cos (1.5*S))
For our example:
F(abs(21-8) =abs(cos(1.5*2.8798))
i or F(11) = 0.38268
Introducing F(S) into the equation of T, gives:
T= S+C*(8/60) +F(S)
For our example:
T= 8.533+0.38268 or T= 8.91568
Transportation is another huge factor in the
equation for T. The number of cars carrying
cavers may either speed or delay the trip, as
shown with the equation for time, t, with
respect to the number of wheels, W, where 3 is
the optimal maximum number of cars and 0.3
is the amount of time per car in a caravan.
t=0.3*(W-3) if W <3, t = 0
pe if W = 3, t = 0
For our example, we will only have two cars in
the caravan. Thus, t= 0.
The final complete equation for the time, T,
spent from sign-out to cave entrance is:
T-S+C*(8/60) +F(S) +t
For our example in which there are 4 cavers in
2 cars, starting out at 8 A.M., the time, T, is:
i
T= 8.91568 A.M.
The total amount of time lost for our example
is less than one hour (0.91568 hours).
NOTE
The above equation is based on what little data
is known about the â€œaverage' caver and by no
means attempts to take into account a caver
known as Kirk. This caver equation will NOT
apply to any trips with KIRK and should NOT
be used as an explanation of tardiness! Also,
not suitable for underground use or
consumption.
