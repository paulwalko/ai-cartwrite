Before you go underground, cut off the excess
material around the round part of the
protractor.
Set the center of the protractor at the first
station and rotate it until a line from the center
to the compass bearing is pointed straight up.
Note whether the compass bearing is red or
black. Using the protractor's straight side, draw
the survey shot in the red or black direction,
stopping when you reach the tape distance.
As an example, starting at station 125, the tape
distance is 17.8 feet, the compass direction is
298°, and the slope is 2°. Set the protractor
center at station 125 and rotate it until 298° is
straight up. I use the colored lines to help
orient the compass. Starting at station 125,
draw the shot in the red direction (298° was on
the red scale) stopping at 17.8 feet. If you have
a steep shot, you may want to draw the actual
horizontal length.
To calculate the horizontal length of the shot,
find the slope angle in the left side of the cosine
table and multiply the taped distance by the
number in the right side of the table. For
example, with a slope between 18° and 329, I
multiply the tape distance by 0.9. An easy way
to calculate 90% is to subtract 10% of the
distance. For example, with a 23.4 foot shot, I
subtract 2.3 feet to get 21.1 feet. To multiply by
0.8, I use the same trick, but subtract 20%.
Using the same distance, but a slope of 35º, I
would subtract 4.6 feet (double the 2.3 feet) to
get 18.8 feet.

Cave Survey Protractor Example
On the actual protractor, the lower degrees (350° to 190°) are in red and the foot to the left of zero are in red.
