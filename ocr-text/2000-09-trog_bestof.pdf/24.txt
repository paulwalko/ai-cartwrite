Club Members Attend 5th Annual YTR
By Michael Cole
This year marked the 5th Annual Young Timers Reunion which was held in April at the WVACS field
station in Greenbrier County, WV. Several cavers from VPI attended and, once again, had a great time
hanging out and meeting cavers from other student grottos. Everyone from VPI went caving on
Saturday. Members broke up into several groups or joined other groups leading trips. Some of the
caves visited by members included McClung's, Benedict's, Bone-Norman, and Cass.
Friday night, everyone spent some time by the campfire listening to
Kirk, Chris Michie, and Dave Colatosti play guitar. Later in the
evening, several members joined in a wild game of Janga. The Janga
game was made more interesting by writing embarrassing tasks on
each piece, which had to be done when the piece was selected. The
game was a lot of fun and lasted for a long time, but was finally
brought to an end when Kirk knocked over the Janga tower.
Saturday night there was a live band from Radford who played
inside the field station. During the band's break, there was a raffle
for a large assortment of prizes. Many VPI members won Nalgene
bottles, hats or shirts. Chris won a Kong carabiner and Kirk won a
caving pack from Howie's Harnesses.
This year's YTR marked one of the largest ever. The WVACS site is
reaching its capacity, and so alternative sites may be considered next year. Wherever it ends up, it is an
event not to miss next year.
