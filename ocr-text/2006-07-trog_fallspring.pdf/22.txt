HALLOWEEN
THE DANCING TRANSSEXUAL
HALLOWEEN WAS A HIT THIS YEAR. THERE WAS A LOT OF PREP WORK THAT A FEW REALLY DEDICATED
THEMSELVES TO. THERE WERE DISPLAYS OF DEAD RATS AND TORTURED TEDDY BEARS. THE HIT OF THE
NIGHT WAS THE HEATED JELL-O WRESTLING RING, WITH THE INFAMOUS NON BIODEGRADABLE JELL-O, WHOSE
REMNANTS STILL CAN BE FOUND TODAY.
WE HAD SOME GREAT COSTUMES THIS PAST HALLOWEEN, INCLUDING FUTRELL AS A CAVE, BRIAN WOLFORD AS
A FREUDIAN SLIP, AND RAY SIRA AS A MAN FROM THE BLUE MAN GROUP.
OUR ALWAYS LOVED CAVE CLUB BANDS, SEPTAPUS AND THE BAND FORMALLY KNOWN AS WHAT THE PEOPLE
WANT, ROUNDED OUT THE EVENING
MEXICO
St.
THE TRIP THIS YEAR WAS SPLIT UP BETWEEN THE VOLCANO CLIMBING MOUN-
TAINEERS, AND THE CAVING, PARTY IN MEXICO GROUP. MEMBERS PHILIP
SCHUCHARDT AND BRIAN WOLFORD WERE TWO OF MOUNTAINEERS, ALONG
WITH DAN ZOE, PETE, JON, AND JIM. THE CREW WENT FOR JUST ABOUT
THE MOST INTRIGUING CLIMB IN MEXICO, ORIZABA. THEY REACHED THE
SUMMIT THE FIRST OF THE YEAR, WITH STILL TIME TO SPARE AND DROP
SOME PITS.
AFTER COMING BACK FROM THE CLIMB THEY RANDOMLY RAN INTO THE
OTHER GROUP IN A QUAINT MEXICAN CITY. AFTER THAT THEY SPLIT UP
AGAIN, AND THE MOUNTAINEERS WENT ON TO DROP GOLONDRINAS AND RIO
CHOY.
