iving his A.B. from that Pennsylvania
institution in 1930 and his A.M. in 1931.
During his college days, he made his first
trip to a cave (Woodward) in 1930. A
few months after his first visit he made
a return trip and captured a rare Leib's
Bat. Thus began a study of cave fauna
which included 5000 miles of travel in
Pennsylvania, alone, during his first win-
ter out of college.
Some of his achievements in the tield
of Speleology are: contributed to Dr.
Ralph Stone's second edition of "Penn-

Ageron Reports on Cuban Visit
Invites U. S. Members to Big
French Cave Meet in July
Pierre Ageron, our famed French
N.S.S. member, has been in Mexico re-
cently on business. On the trip over,
he stopped off in Cuba, met some of our
Cuban members and reports that there
are at least 500 active speleologists on
our neighboring Isle. Pierre says he
enjoyed leading 15 French cavers to
England last August, spending a week
in the field with Glennie, Platten and
other English cavers well known in these
columns
M. Ageron's biggest news is that a
big and important cave meet will be
held in France's famous cavern country
sometime in July. The meet will take in
some of France's caves of medium depth
(which means over 100 meters deep) and
a group of English cavers is already
making plans to attend. Pierre urges
that the U. S. be represented by a party
of N.S.S. members. He states that liv-
ing expenses are low and food plentiful
in the caving areas.
Erftenbeck and California Group
Visit Mercers Cavern
We are pleased to get the news that
our farthest west Grotto is continuing
active in cave field work. Chuck Erften-
beck, the organizer of our (first) Cali-
fornia Grotto, and several members
spent the Thanksgiving holiday at Mer-
cers Caverns. This is a commercial cave
having seven rooms now open to the
public. The group spent three days ex-
ploring five new channels for the man-
arement.
