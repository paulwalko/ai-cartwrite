Step 5
Break the Connector
Light some plastic on fire and let it drip on the
connector to insulate the wires, then realize you're
probably making toxic smoke in your bathroom.
Just after this realization, make sure a flaming
piece of plastic breaks the solder on the connector
and spend the next hour trying to reattach it.

Step 6 Test the Connection
Test the battery box
Figure A: something screwed up
Figure B: good

Step 7 Modify the LED Lamp
Using precision tools, void any possible
warranty on the lamp. Then epoxy every
possible entrance into the lamp (including
the new wire holes in the back). Hook up
the battery box, and you're done!**
Step 8 Buy a New Light
Just remember you actually did accom-
plish something (see step 1), despite the
complete unreliability of the retrofitted
lamp.***
Tlf wired incorrectly, this can still serve as a good backup heat source.
**None of this has actually been tested. At the time of this article, the author was con-
templating whether his personal safety outweighs curiosity.
***Patents may be pending if the author tests the lamp and doesn't die..
