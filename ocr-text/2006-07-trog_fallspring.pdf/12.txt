gets to be much tougher when you're
dealing with those amounts of rope
weight. I am not strong enough to bend
the rope around the rack and now have to
bend the rack around the rope. After I
had rigged in I rappelled down a little
ways so TinY could rig in above us, Tin Y's
rigging in was more challenging because
he now had Lance and myself below him,
| but he seemed to manage with little effort.
And that's how we performed the world
record triple rappel at Golindrinas, with
TinY on the top, me in the middle and
Lance on the bottom. There were many
subsequent Nikky sandwich jokes for the
rest of the trip.

| rappeller forced me to rappel with an
effective rope weight of Lance with 200
of 290 pounds below me. This meant that TinY had to rig in and rappel the weight of me,
Lance and the rope approxiamatly 460 pounds of weight below him. Thsi is what that
type of weight does to a 3/8‚Äù diameter frame 24" long rappelling rack.
et TinY's initial work on the long drop tandem rappelling was to expand the
envelope of this technique as a rescue technique to come to the aid of rappeller or
climbers on long drops where traditionally only one rope would be available. The
triple tandem rappel is a natural extension of this desire which permits coming to
the aid of a pair of distressed climbers, since tandem climbing on long drops is the
norm. The weights and physics of our triple rappel at Golindrinas are also similar to
the weight and physics experienced on TinY's world record tandem rappel of El
Capitan and similar conditions to what was expected for his planned trip to Mount
Thor in 2008 when rappelling access to the mountain was recently closed.
