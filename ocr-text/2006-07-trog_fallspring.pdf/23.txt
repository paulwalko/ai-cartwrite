AND CAITLIN DEIGHAN. THE REST OF THE TRIP

HIS BROTHER, TSULAMA, AND THE DEIGHAN. THE
GROUP DROPPED MOST OF THE PLANNED PITS, BUT
WERE UNFORTUNATELY NOT ALLOWED TO GO INTO
Rio CHOY ACCORDING TO THE MEXICO MILITARY,
WHEN THE CREW THE DAY BEFORE DID IT NO PROB-
LEM.
THE TRIP ENCOUNTERED A BIT OF CAR TROUBLE.
ALICES BIG VAN DECIDED THAT IT WANTED TO
STOP ALL POWER STEERING AND POWER BRAKES

STREET, WHERE YOU HAD PEOPLE WALKING AROUND
FROM ALL SIDES. FORTUNATELY FOR ALICE, AFTER
INFORMING HER FATHER OF THE SITUATION, HE FELT
BAD AND PROMISED TO GET HER A NEW CAR WHEN
SHE GOT BACK. WELL AFTER A TUNE UP THE CAR

ABLE TO GET HOME.
