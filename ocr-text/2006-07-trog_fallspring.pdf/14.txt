the rest of the trip.
2006-2007
I picked up a butterfly at the bottom of the pit 24
who hung out on my hand for a while. I've had
butterfly's land on me at Stevens Gap, Neversink,
Sinking Cove, and in Colombia. I'm not sure why the
and on me, but once they do they stay for a while.
He landed on me while I was at the bottom of the
rope and stayed with me through the walk over to the
register and the signing of it. The register is a book
that's kept in a Tupperware tub on a rock that every-
bne who visits the cave can sign. There are messages,
notes and signatures from cavers from all over the
world. So we got some pictures of him with the book.
guess they don't call me “Princess Butterfly" for
hothing. This was the first one I actually had land on
me IN the cave and I'd never seen this type before.
His wings were clear except for around the edges,
notice how you can see my fingers through him in the
closeup. We took another look through the book to
see some of the other entries that had been written
since we had been there last. More pages were used
than last time since the book is wet now and you can
only write on the bottom third of the pages.
Lance, Robin and Ben climbed out first on a triple
climb so TinY and I had to keep ourselves occupied at
| the bottom of the pit for an hour and a half. Watch-
ing these three climb together and listening to their
