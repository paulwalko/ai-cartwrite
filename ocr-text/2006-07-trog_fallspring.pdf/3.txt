wanan Won Thani on a Why I Cave
by Proffessor Brian Wolford
The further progress into the pastime that is
caving, the more) find myself faced with one repeating
question. Why? The answer to this question | find is quite
simple, as I believe it is for any sane person. Because that's
where they hide all the treasure, dumbass!! It is shown
repeatedly again and again in up-standing Hollywood films,
usually based on truc events | take it. Anyone who's seen
The Goonies knows this fact. Also, because of that movie
I bring a funny little Asian kid with a bunch of hysterical
gizmos EVERY time I cave. In another example, Pirates of
the Caribbean, where was that treasure? In a bigass cave!
Not only are we faced with this undeniable truth in
movies, but also in video games. I distinctly remember
playing King's Quest (something between land VI) and
finding treasure in a cave. Why? Because that is where
they put all the treasure. I mean seriously, don't you wonder
why you don't see any treasure when you're walking down
the street? THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S ALL IN
THE CAVES! Seriously people, how much clearer
could it be?
We can even look to ancient times for examples.
Remember when Aladdin found his treasure when he said
"open sesame‚Äù. Not to mention biblical references to the
Cave Of Treasures in the book of the New Testament
apocrypha, which was distinctly left out and declared
heretical. Hmm, coincidence? I submit that it is not; I smell a
Vatican cover-up. Let's get Dan Brown on this and let
these Papal fat cats know we mean business! That treasure
is there for the taking, and we won't be dissuaded any,
longer!!
