I tried to take on a different approach this year and cater more towards the landowners. It all
began with Samantha Garguilo being kind enough to design and help send out over 30 invitations
to our landowners. While we waited to hear from them, a decision on the presentation topic had to
be made. My first thought was what would be of interest to the landowners. After pondering this
for a bit, I decided if I were a landowner and had the same strange people showing up on my
doorstep week after week to go in a hole in the ground, I'd want to know why they get so excited
when they visit, what they are really doing when they go down there, and what my cave looks like.
In addition to this, I thought it would be interesting to everyone else to see how we did things in
the past and how they have changed over the years. So, I started researching the club files for old
pictures and was surprised to see we had a very well organized photo album and scrapbook with
information from the 1940's through 1980. I was also able to collect photos from Chip Clark, Rich-
ard Cobb, Craig Ferguson, Kevin Rock, and Ray Sira (I apologize if I forgot anyone). Now that I had a
topic and a bunch of pictures, I needed a speaker. This proved to be more challenging than
expected. After several failed attempts at getting a speaker, Ray Sira felt sorry for me and stepped
up to the plate. When Banquet day arrived, Ray did not disappoint and gave a great presentation.
Landowners were amazed, the old farts reminisced, and the newest members saw a lot of the great
caves to visit and continue to explore.
Banquet was a great success and everyone seemed to enjoy the time together visiting with the
landowners and old friends they hadn't seen in awhile. It would not have been possible without
the help of others. I would like to send a very special thank you to all of those who helped and to
recognize a few people that put in some extra effort.
