Previously when discussing triple tandemi rappelling with Brise l e had voiced
concerns about the deflection of the rack frame and its potential cu t ively impacting
the control of the rappel. Having practiced with these extremistis i ng with a
tree and progressively working up to Whitesides, even that

it had not had a negative impact on the tappel to date. it was ki d s, body

friends and the previous year her and her husband had left kind loving words in the log
book for someone they had no idea would be reading them until this year
Ben was the last into the pit after doing an excellent job photographing and docu-
menting this world record triple tandem rappel. I made sure to capture a few good shots
of him rappelling at the bottom of the pit since he so many good pictures of us through.
