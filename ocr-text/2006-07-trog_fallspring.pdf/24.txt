IT ENDED UP BEING ONE OF THE BEST PICNICS YET. THE
WEATHER WAS PERFECT FROM BEGINNING TO END. THE
TRADITION OF THE MARSH MELLOW WARS HELD STRONG,
THE POTLUCK DINNER AND GRILL WAS DELICIOUS, AND OF
COURSE PROVIDED FOR ALL OF YOUR VEGETARIAN NEEDS,
AND A WEEKENDS WORTH OF CAVING HAD NO OBJECTIONS.
ROUNDED OUT WITH PARTY WITH ALL YOUR FRIENDS OUT
IN A COW FIELD, THERE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN ANYWHERE
ELSE BETTER TO BE.

WE WERE WELCOMED THIS YEAR BY SOME GREAT
WEATHER, THAT USHERED A DAYS FULL OF HIDING
SOME BEERS AND DRINKING THEM TOO. THERE
WERE A FEW SURPRISES, INCLUDING SOME INFLAMED
BEERS HANGING IN TREES, AND SOME CLEVER HIDDEN
COOL AID BOTTLES.
FLOAT TRIP
THIS YEAR THERE WAS SOME DRAMA BETWEEN THE NEW
JERSEY AND VPI FLOAT, WHEN SOME NEW JERSEY FLOAT-
ERS CAME ONTO THE VPI RAFT AS IT WAS DISASSEMBLING
ITSELF, AND THEY SAT THERE, ATE OUR FOOD AND
WATCHED. IN THE END, IT WAS VOTED THAT THEY WERE
TO WALK THE PLANK!
