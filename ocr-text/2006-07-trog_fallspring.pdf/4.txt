The Elusive Cave Beavers
by Stewart Scales
On my first vertical trip with the VPI Cave Club, I went into
Clover Hollow. After arriving at midday and unloading and
prepping all the gear, Geoff went down the entrance pit first by
himself so he could belay us trainees on the two ropes we had set up,
I decided to go down first, hooked into the rope, and began the
descent. On my way down, which was a little tricky at first, I heard
words from Geott that made me stop everything was doing:
“There's something alive down here."
My first thought was it was time to change over to ascending
and give up on Geoff. After a few cautious seconds, Geoff spoke
again, "I think it's a beaver!”
Seeing that he was alive and probably was going to remain
alive (provided it wasn't a Monty Python killer rabbit-like beaver), I
decided to continue the rappel. After getting off rope, Geoff
proclaimed to me that he thought it was a beaver. Ilooked down into
the cave a little bit and saw a very disgruntled groundhog that had
fallen down the seventy foot pit and survived with several broken
bones. After a closer look at the poor animal, | clarified that it
wasn't the elusive cave beaver as Geoff had thought. It was just a
groundhog that wanted to be a lemming.
A Few moments later from up top, I heard Deighan's voice
echo down the drop, “Did you bring a gun?” Then | became
worried, thinking to myself, "If we're carrying guns into caves these
days..." Thankfully, Geoff replied that he did not have a firearm on
him, and we would have to dispose of our injured friend in a different
manner. After everyone completed the first drop, we decided that
we were going to hit him in the head with a large rock on the way back
out and then remove what was left.
We were underground for around six hours, and surely
enough when we came back out to the entrance there was no
groundhog-beaver to be found. I had contemplated leaving him my
chest ascender, but I forgot he probably wouldn't even be able to tie
a harness with a broken arm..
