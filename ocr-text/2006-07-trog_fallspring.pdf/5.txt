CAVING BELIZE STYLE

I found myself in Belize this spring break with no intention of going caving. But of
course I did go, and that has taught me a new lesson about world travel: always pack your
caving gear, because you never know.

I didn't know it beforehand, but Belize (just south of Mexico, on the Yucatan peninsula) is
riddled with limestone caves. On the van ride out to the jungle, I kept pointing at
promising-looking holes and asking the guide if they led to caves, and the answer was
always “probably.” The guy grew up exploring the caves of the area, but there were still
holes everywhere that nobody had ventured into. Our destination cave, however, was sup-
posedly used by the Mayans for various ceremonies, and had the pots and fire pits to prove
it. I am a little skeptical. It would seem like if you had a cave with authentic priceless Mayan
artifacts inside, you would close it off and keep random people from tromping through it.
However, this is Belize, a very poor country, and tourists are serious money. Either way, I'd
like to hold on to the illusion that these pots are authentic.
The big one wouldn't fit through the entrance so it was cast inside the cave, according to the
guide.
At the very narrow entrance we were given a tiny, underpowered LED headlamp and no
helmet. The lack of helmets was a little unsettling. While there was no crawling involved
except for the entrance, there was a lot of crouching and avoiding low-hanging stalactites.
I'm one of those people who bash their helmets on a regular basis, but I've discovered that
when it's your unprotected head at stake, you watch the ceiling a little more carefully.
At the end of the easily-traveled portion of the cave, about 1,000 feet in, the guide had us all
turn off our lamps. Then he said to us, “Now I would like everyone to hand anything you
have with an LED or screen to me and my brothers, and we will leave the cave. If any of
you make it out, you can have one of the ATVs outside that you rode here on.” There were a
few vertical pits here and there, and if he had been serious then that would have been the
end of the road for us. I think I like Belize humor.
