TRIPLE TANDEM RAPPEL Tech Torrent
OF EL SOTANO DE LAS GOLINDRINAS
DECEMBER 28TH, 2006
BY NIKKY“PRINCESS BUTTERFLY” LABRANCHE -
We got up early to head to up the road to Golindrinas from Mike Walsh's house where we
were staying. We had originally planned to head up the night before to save us some time
in the morning, but things didn't work out that way. When we got up to Golindrinas we
found Santos and contracted with him to carry our rope to the pit and he took off on the
trail with it. They always beat us to the pit with the rope, even if all we are carrying is a
water bottle. The group that day consisted of Tin Y, Ben Kim, and Lance and Robin Mitch-
ell and myself. We rigged the 1150' high side with a pulley redirect off a large tree limb
that overhung the pit and a progress capture for a Georgia haul on the line. This way the
pit is prerigged for a rescue and we can enlist the aid of the locals for a Georgia haul, as well
as prerigged for the hauling at the end of the day.

Nikky and Tiny tandem rappeling Cepillos (413)
The first rappel that day was our world record setting triple rappel performed by Mike “Tin Y
Manke, myself and Lance Mitchell. TinY and I had over 8000' of tandem rappel experience
leading up to this rappel. The 8000’ included the first tandem rappels by a male-female team
of Golindrinas (1150'), Guaguas (1700) and Bridge Day (876'). We had also rappelled White-
sides with simulated rope weight in preparation for our trip to El Capitan in June. Several
days earlier we had tandem rappelled Cepillos with me as the top tandemer just to make sure
our methods and procedures were sound.
