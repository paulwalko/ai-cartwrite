Ants and Caves
by Ben Townsend
I've been contemplating the caving community, and I think it ||
resembles an ant colony. The most obvious parallel is the simi-
larity between ants scurrying through nest tunnels and cavers
scurrying through caves. Diving deeper into this analogy, in the
cave club there are distinct ant-like activities going on:tending
the young (training trips); expanding the nest (blasting out
potential new holes); and foraging (ridge walking). Of course,
there is also the well known fact that after a few years a caver
develops the ability to lift forty to fifty times their own weight,
much like an ant.
There are a few inconsistencies. Cavers have no queen, not that I've seen, although maybe I haven't been
around long enough. They also don't leave pheromone scent trails to mark out paths (at least not inten-
tionally); however, I see this as an excellent idea which merits further research. The smell centers of the
brain are placed right next to the memory centers, which is why smells evoke memories so well. We
should carry scent-dispensing devices. That way, if you get lost and loop around on yourself, you can be
like, "Hey, this passage smells like chocolate, I've been here." As a bonus, everyone will smell great.
