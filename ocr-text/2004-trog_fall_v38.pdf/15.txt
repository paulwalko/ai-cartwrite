The Woes of Wine Continues
By: Chris Michie
Finally, after repeated warnings, the
hellfire and brimstone rains down from
the heavens and strikes down all the
old Coleman stoves in a fireball of glory!
After the earthquakes, plagues, and coming
of the anti-Christ, all those who got into the
bottle (in this case, quite literally) were struck
down and left in very compromised positions.
And some
were more
others...yiffing?
of the positions
compromising than
BAD TIGGER!
So let this be a lesson to all you trainees,
young and old.... Beware the woes of
wine, and don't fall in the ditch at OTR!
