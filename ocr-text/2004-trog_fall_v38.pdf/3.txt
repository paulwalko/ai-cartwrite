Getting To Know You
I am Eric Steinberg, a sophomore Mining
Eng, from NJ. I am looking for a girl who
gives good massages, loves cuddling, can
have thought provoking conversations
and is a virgin. My first caving experi-
ence was at Tawney's with Venture Out.
I am Rutger Thomschutz from the
New River Valley. My first caving ex-
perience was at Newberrys. I had
a great experience, which sparked
my interest in becoming a member.
I am Philip Schuchardt, a fresh-
man majoring in Computer Science.
My first caving experience was some-
where in West Virginia. If I could
be any animal it would be a wolf.
I am Lisa Droubi, a Junior majoring in
Natural Resource Recreation, from MD. I
am looking for a guy who is funny, nice,
and has nice eyes. I am not that picky!
First caving experience was Smoke-
hole. If I could be an animal I would be
a bear because they sleep all the time.
I am Chris Glomb, a sophomore CS/GE
major, from PA. My first caving experi-
ence was at OTR 2004. I am looking
for a girl who is an outdoor and mu-
sic lover, who is also smart and nice.
I am Ruth Williams, a Junior majoring
in Urban forestry, from Yorktown VA. If I
could be an animal I would be an elephant
so I can play in the mud and eat a lot.
