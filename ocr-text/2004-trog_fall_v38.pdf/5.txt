Destruction With the Hydrominer

Making a new cave is a hell of a lot of work. When the hole starts collapsing get yourself
Pulling out loose dirt and rock from a want to and the hydrominer out of there. Obviously,

can make digging on a site much easier. It can become easy damaged if a large rock

is the sufficient water source. Mountain
streams are excellent for water and can be
easily dammed. Building a strong dam is
key. Build it far enough up stream so that
the hose from the damn can have enough
pressure. The more pressure in the hose
the quicker it is to blast things into the
cave. A good size hose is also important.
Black four inch drainage hose works well.
It is cheap and readily available from
most hardware stores. Another excellent
way to increasing pressure is by adding
a reducer on the end of the hose. This
can be accomplished with a four inch to
two inch PVC reduction piece. Attaching
the PVC can be tricky but parachute
core and duck tape seems to work well.
