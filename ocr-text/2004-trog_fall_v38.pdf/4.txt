Getting To Know You
Not Pictured
I am Gregory Gannon, a sophomore
in engineering, Chesapeake VA. I am
looking for a girl who is nice, fun-
ny, able to let go of rules sometimes
to have fun, and laughs at my jokes.
I am Kai Meiun, a freshmen ma-
joring in engineering and music,
from Japan. My first caving expe-
rience was in James. If I could be
any animal it would be a Dragon.
THRAWUR
I am Caitlin Coove, a freshman in universi-
ty studies. My first cave trip experience was
horrible. If I could be any animal it would
be a T-Rex, because then I'd be on TV, and I
would have wings. I am looking for a guy who
is sweet, intelligent, must play video games,
should love music, and buys me chocolate.
I am Blue Clements, a freshman ma-
joring in a lot of different stuff, from
Herndon VA. My first caving experi-
ence was amazing. I want to be a bird
so I can fly if I could be any animal.
I am Dustin Schleifer, a freshman in en-
gineering, from Sterling VA. I am looking
for a girl with a nice smile, kid at heart,
likes to play video games generally com-
passionate and caring. My first caving
experience was an awesome time at Links.
I am Courtney Kimball, a freshman
in U. Studies, from VA. I am looking
for a guys who has a sense of humor,
nice body, umm.. long walk on the
beach. My first caving experience I
fell twice in the underground stream.
Sorry to any new people that might have gotten left out!
