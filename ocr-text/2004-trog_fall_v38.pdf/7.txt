How to write a Trog article: The 9 Step process to success!
by Rob Story
Step 1: Remember that we have a publication.
No good Trog article can be written without remembering that we actually have a
Trog. This first step is a very important one, and often easy to skip, given the beer induced
stupor that seems to be common among the club.
Step 2: Tell the editor you will get her an article “soon”, knowing you will forget.
This next step is very important to the article writing process. A vague promise to the
Trog editor buys you time, letting you have the free time to cave, drink, and *gasp* study
(This last one seems to be low on the priority list of many cave club students). This verbal
commitment to write an article will buy you at least a couple weeks of being lazy.
Step 3: Forget
This step is crucial! You must not remember to write your Trog article until the
very last minute. This author happens to believe that last minute panic is the most
inspirational way to write. Therefore you need to kick back, relax, go caving, and
completely fail to remember about your promise to write an article.
Step 4: Un-forget, with some helpful encouragement from the Trog editor
You need some help on this next step of remembrance. Often the Trog editor will
remind the cave club of the upcoming publication during the Friday meetings. Death
threats for those who don't write anything are not uncommon. You will remember that you
need to get around to writing the article, promising yourself that you will write it soon.
Step 5: Re-forget
See Step 3.
Step 6: Try and Compromise with the Trog editor
It's a couple of weeks until the Trog articles are due, and you don't have anything.
Here's the plan: Stall. Tell the editor that you have something really good in store, it's just
not finished yet. Tell them that your article is going to be Pulitzer worthy, but real genius
takes time.
Step 7: Give in to the Demands of the Editor and write the Article
This step can often be difficult, but it is an inevitable one on the path to a successful
Trog article. The editor of the Trog has been emailing the listserv and asking you every
chance they get that you need to turn in your article. At some point(usually the day that
the article is due), you have to give in an actually write something. A way around this step
is to draw a cartoon or make a puzzle, whether it makes sense or not.
