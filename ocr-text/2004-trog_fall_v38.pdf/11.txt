Getting to Know You (Club Officers)

I've been caving since freshman year--> 3 yrs. I got started after I saw a table card in Detrick.
Hobbies: Reading, doing homework, being a nerd. I suppose watching
foreign movies in spanish counts as being a nerd too. Cave club--> nerd. Once I graduate I intend to NOT get
an engineering job. Maybe one dealing with urban planning or something. I saw an interesting job opp. at
Marsbars dealing with peanut research--peanuts are materials! I swear they are!
Favorite cave: Links & Pighole. Yes, I can count...that's two. But one's vertical and one's horizontal...they're
two different animals.Anything the cave club doesn't know about you but should? -I think the club already
knows too much (or at least thinks it does.) I'm a very silly
person when I'm not in school or leading meetings or thinking about school or thinking about meetings...OR...

How long have you caved and what got you started? I went on an extremely stupid nerd caver trip lead by
my RA in the dorms. No helmets, flashlight in teeth, the whole (lack of) nine yards. At some point I decided
this was fun, but probably not the safe way to be doing it. The next year I finally got around to joining the
club, at which point Mike^3 showed me a safer variant of caving technique that included a helmet.
Hobbies: Music (Listening and playing guitar/piano), Video games, backpacking, biking, zombie movies,
What will you do once you graduate? You're looking at it. I graduated and decided to do more school.
Eventually I want to do something with the interaction between humans and computers (or any other
machine), possibly something in the assistive technology area.
Anything the cave club doesn't know about you but should? I'm colorblind. If you wear red or green pants,
I can see your underwear.

Ive been caving since I was about 7 years old...my dad had been caving since he was in college, and got me
into it as soon as I was old enough to do it. I grew up going to Beacon, Honaker, and New River cave.
Hobbies
I like doing pretty much anything that involves the outdoors...hiking, biking, backpacking, etc. I also enjoy
reading and playing the occasional video game.
What will you do once you graduate?
Anything that involves someone giving me a job. I've thought about Grad school, and will make that decision
when the time comes around.
Favorite cave
Favorite cave, eh? Tough one...I think that Beacon cave, in East River Mountain with the entrances behind St.
Lukes hospital, has to be my favorite cave. I grew up going to that cave, and even though there is no vertical,
there is lots of cool steam passage as well as a slow moving
whirlpool sump in the back of the cave.

I started caving at the beginning of last year so about a year and a half. I had gone caving a few
times with the Boy Scouts when I was younger and decided I liked dark holes.
Hobbies - Long walks in dark damp passages, candle lit dinners for two, and a
nice relaxing movie for 2 following that dinner
Favorite Cave - Clover Hollow until it kicked my ass the other week
