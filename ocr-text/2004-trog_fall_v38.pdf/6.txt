EG5
VPI's newest dig is EG5. It is located in a
sink hole about 2 miles up the valley from
Alva Blankenship Cave. A small stream
runs in to the sink and disappears into
the earth. The dig has the same symptoms
as Alva. Hydromining is used extensively
on the site. The soon to be cave takes as
much water as you can put into it. Mr.
Wheeler, the land owner of EG5, wanted
to make a pond out of the sink hole.
He tried blasting the hole and poured
concrete down into it. None of which
seemed to stop the water. Digging has
stop on EG5 until the spring due to the
weather. If you want to go play at EG5 talk
to Steve Wells and he will put you to work.

What Each Anniversary Reflects
By Doug Moore
• At 5 years: a caving organization is discovering they aren't afraid of the dark
• At 10 years: they start playing in the mud
• At 15 years: they start trying dangerous things like vertical
• At 20 years: they find out that virgin passages are fun to discover
At 30 years: they find they didn't fully explore and map what they found in their
20's
• At 40 years: is when they start collecting books
• At 50 years: is when they want to run for office and have power
• At 60 years: is when they decide it was fun being 20 and go looking for more virgin
passage
