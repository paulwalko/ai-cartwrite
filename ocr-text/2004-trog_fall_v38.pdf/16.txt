How to: Use Caving to Pick Up Women*
By David Klorig**
So you are slugging down cheap beer at
happy hour before the meeting when you
happen to notice a young vixen sitting at the
bar. You think to yourself, how can I make
this beautiful specimen take notice of me, a
lowly shell of a man sporting a beer gut and
too much facial hair (reader appearance may
vary). Relax friend for you are one of the few,
the proud, the intensely desirable, a caver.
But how to go from a longing stair from
across the room to a sleeping bag warmer?
diving if she needs more convincing. If
she is into adventurous men then you
will know that you have taken the
right tactic when she hangs on every
word of your exciting caving story.
Be careful though, nobody likes a
bragger. You've got to be slick about
it. Make her ask for the exciting story.
Lead up to it and then be like well you
probably wouldn't be interested. If she
agrees with you then switch tactics.
First:
Be realistic. Not all women want a fiery romp
with a mud frolicking subterranean. Before
wasting precious time and energy check
the area for tote bags with Greek letters or
penciled-in eyebrows. It goes without saying
that people with fake nails won't want to get
mud under them. If the coast is clear then
you can proceed. The easiest way to talk to a
girl is if you don't care if she likes you. This
requires a certain amount of mental fortitude
(use the force Luke). If she thinks you are
nervous or otherwise not at peace in the head
she will take off, or possibly milk you for free
alcohol and then take off. After even a short
conversation you should be able to figure out
which tactical caving pickup approach to take.
#2 If she is a tree hugger, then play
up the cave conservation angle. Tell
her you are in a desperate race to map
and photograph these precious natural
resources before the evil quarriers,
well diggers, and leaky septic systems
destroy them forever. You can usually
coax some concern out of most people
with this approach, even if its fake
concern. Make sure you emphasize
your selfless quest to do what you
believe is right. Chicks dig that.
There are three:
#1 If you detect even a hint of
adventurousness in her personality
then play up the exploration,
discovery, braving the odds to go
where no man has been before aspect
of caving. Make it seem like you are
climbing Mount Everest underground.
You might want to bring up cave
#3 If she is a biology major and doesn't
hate biology (there are but a few) then
you can play up the scientific quest for
knowledge about rare and strange cave
creatures. Be sure and tell her that if
you're lucky you might be able to find
some translucent cave cricket that
holds the key to the cure for cancer
or AIDS or something. Although it
might not be the stereotype, women
really do like smart guys, I swear
(at least the good ones anyway).
