How to write a Trog article: The 9 Step process to success! Continues
by Rob Story
Step 8: Bask in the glory of being published
The day has arrived. The Trogs are hot off the press and being thrust into the hands
of eager cave club members. You open up your copy, anticipating the glory that comes with
a successful article. Seven pages later...you find yours. Unfortunately, all of your hard
work has been moved behind seemingly more important articles, such as the discovery of
a new cave or the presentation of an award to a land owner. However, you don't have the
distinction of being the last article in the Trog, which goes to the obligatory Tawney's trip
report. Bask in your glory....you are now a published author.
Step 9: Go back to forgetting we have a Trog
Eat, drink, sleep, cave, and be merry. The next Trog is months away from being
published, and you don't have to worry about writing another article until then. Enjoy your
freedom from writing until next time, when this 9 Step guide to success will once again lead
you to Trog article glory.
Note: This informative guide can also be applied to how not to write a Trog article. The
simplest way to achieve this goal is to never leave Step 3. However, a word of warning:
Often this leads to a new Step 4: Fight off the editor as they chase you with implement of
death.
What a Grand Cave!
By: Samantha Lambert
Once I joined the VPI Cave Club I found The beauty that these caves hold is a learning
myself disliking show caves and what they experience for everyone. The flow stone, col-
were all about. I would make fun of the tour umns, draperies and shield formations are a
guides leading the trips and the stalagmites spectacular site to see even if most of them are
that were attached to the ceiling and not glued in place. I now look at show caves as
the floor. I thought it was ridiculous to pay the introduction to
money to get lead through the cave on a path caving. If you find
that was made out of concrete. That whole yourself in one of
view of mine changed after Spring VAR. these caves asking
all the questions,
VAR was located in Grottoes Virginia, home poking your head
to Grand Caverns. This cave was my first into holes, and
caving experiences at the age of 9. Back then wanting to go off
I found myself wondering off from the group the concrete path
to poke my head into holes that were pitch then you know you
black. After going back into Grand Caverns should try caving.
at VAR I remember how it left me with curios-
ity that brought me back to caving in college.
This cave along with other show caves have
so much potential to get new people caving.
