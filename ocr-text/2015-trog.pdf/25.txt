The Legend of Peppy
Nick Socky, the son of two former members,
would be the president we'll all remember
as cartographer, raver, and life-member caver
whose love of caves is like an un-dying ember.
Nick Socky's father, a caver called 'Dave',
should be proud of his son who consistently gave
hours upon hours of his free-time to slave
over the mapping and exploring of the famed Maze Cave.
Nick Socky however was more than just a spelunker.
He was a tuba-player to often be found in the bunker.
Then, VTubas behaved as much as they their livers saved
while they continued to grow drunker and drunker.
Nick Socky's mother, a caver called 'Mary Sue',
should be as proud as Dave of her son too.
He studied A.O.E., got his hard-earned degree,
and works in the field he prepared to.
Nick Socky's love, devotion, and concern
for Sarah surpasses his love of any cavern.
Tried and true, in high school and college through,
he remained a faithful boyfriend to her.
Nick Socky's legacy will always and forever be
a terrific story and model for a trainee.
His level of enthusiasm is greater than the largest chasm
thus he will always be remembered as President Peppy.
