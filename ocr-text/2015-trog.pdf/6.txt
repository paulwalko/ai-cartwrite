LETTER FROM THE EDITOR
So, I've never written one of these before nor do I know what really goes in them but I'll
just go along with what those before me have said. This is my first time being Trog Edi-
tor and I have to say it has been time-consuming but fun! Thanks to everyone for
sending me articles and pictures. I wish more people would have contributed this se-
mester, especially because there is a pile of trainees who will be read this and have not
sent me anything. I hope future editors and trainees will look through old trogs and
use them as references and see how much our club has evolved over the years. I have
enjoying getting to read through everyone's stories and relive their caving adventures.
It is awesome how much caving VPI is able to do throughout the course of a year. This
year has been so busy with 10 new members, all of our annual events, and lots of spe-
leopolitics! Our members are now all over the world. I am excited about what has been
happening in the VPI community and I hope to showcase all these events through this
Trog. I hope you enjoy!
