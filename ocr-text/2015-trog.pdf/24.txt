“At the Bottom of the Dome”
David Henry
Didley's Dome is now its home
And it's color may have once been green
The time was last November, If I can remember
That It was last seen
For it took a good tumble and made a loud rumble
As it fell, and it fell, and it fell
From Joe's steady hand, it obeyed gravities demand
And now rests where it will now dwell
It likely plopped on a pile of mud and except for the Chuds
There's nothing down there to take it away
For the trip's nothing piddly, traveling to the bottom of Didley
So there it will likely stay
It has a sad lonely fate unless a few can create
A mission, a quest, or a search
To travel down, down to Didley's before getting too tiddly
And rescue it from it's poor solitary perch
The trip will be long but it simply doesn't belong
There at the bottom of the Dome
So who among you care to join the rescue,
To bring it back to it's above ground home?
