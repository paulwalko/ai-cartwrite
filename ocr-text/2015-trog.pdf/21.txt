Figure 6. Double Bight bowline with back-off
The double bight bowline knot length is also com-
pared to the other knots in Table 2. The double bight
bowline uses about ten percent less rope than the bow-
line with the overhand back-off.
Prohaska [1] describes the double bight bowline as
simple, clear, easily inspected, and shows no perceptible
tendency to capsize or work loose. In addition to sug-
gesting the use of the double loop bowline in place of
the Yosemite bowline, I propose an additional modifica-
tion as a double back off. The double bight bowline
working end extends out of the knot 90 degrees to the
working line. The modification to this knot resembles
the Yosemite back-off. The working end is wrapped
around the closest loop and follows into the bowline
loop retracing the standing line. The knot with this pro-
posed back-off is shown in Figure 6, and the length of
the knot is given in Table 2.
