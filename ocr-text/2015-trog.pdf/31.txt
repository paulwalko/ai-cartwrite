Fellow Caver’s and Prospective Caver’s,
It has been a long and enjoyable process acquiring the elements to be considered for membership in to the VPI Cave Club. Having experienced some of the caves in this area plus Tennessee and Mexico, I real- ize that there is an underground world that is not only astonishing, but that has only been partially dis- covered. I am looking forward to my newest adventure in the cave world hopefully as a VPI Cave Club Member. I have to credit Walt Pirie for introducing me to the cave club. The places he has been and things he’s done are incredible. Like doing some of the longest pits in Mexico and rappelling the bridge before it was finished. Steve Wells deserves credit for his technical assistance and knowledge (not that he’s that smart) of being on rope. John Deighan and Sarah Crowder also deserve mentioning for they have been the ones that I have taken the most trips with. These people as a whole, with their experi- ence, knowledge, caving background and being on rope is immeasurable. Thank you all for sharing your expertise with me and helping me in my learning experience. As for the caving experience, I have learned to be on rope, use friction in ways that I have never thought of, put my body into positions that I did not think possible and have literally lived on the edge. One of my most memorable experiences was hearing the acoustics of “Amazing Grace” resonating throughout the cave while in Triple Wells. Triple Wells is a 200’ drop in a cave called Newberry/Banes. To get to the drop you follow a narrow passage for a couple of hundred feet off the main passage. Nearing the end of the passage the floor opens up enough to see the 200’ drop below. A pigtail is rigged for a safety line so you don’t fall through the crack in the floor. The opening is not big enough to rappel through comfortably, so while still moving forward you have to straddle the canyon for another 20 to 30’. At the very end of the passage it opens up into what they call Triple Wells. While still straddling the canyon below your feet, and tied to the safety line, you will find 2 bolts used for rigging the main drop. Using a double figure 8 for the anchor knot, this will al- low you to rig onto the rope and do the drop with no interference. Sarah went first, and while rappelling 200’, started singing “Amazing Grace”. The guys on the trip joined in and harmonized quite well. I per- sonally cannot sing, so I just kinda mouthed the words and sat back and listened. I thought it sounded good. Good harmony with a damn good drop in a damn good cave. Hard to beat. The club should consid- er having a committee for the “Cave Club Choir”! When I originally thought of a “Caver”, I thought, “Ahh, what the hell, that aint nothing, you’re just crawling around a hole in the ground”. Now, after seeing and experiencing the real thing, I have come to realize why people have a desire to explore the hidden cavernous world that is right beneath our feet. It is truly a breathtaking experience and I have learned that it takes experience, knowledge, and physical fitness to be a caver. Only a few people are cut out to be a caver. A “Caver” is truly a well- earned title.
