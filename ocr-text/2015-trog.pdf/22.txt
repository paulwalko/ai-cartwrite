Looking for Goats in Caves
by Eliot Edling
So I need to write an article for the Tech Troglodyte. I don't really do much writing these days besides
what is required for my work, and my last creative writing course was almost a decade ago.
While I have been on many enjoyable caving trips, I am not the kind of storyteller who can
readily turn an almost mundane trip into an exciting or humorous anecdote. On multiple occasions, I
have witnessed a caver recount an event that, at the time, wasn't terribly interesting but, under the in-
fluence of their well-practiced lips, would become an epic tale of overcoming adversity, misfortune,
or stupidity.
This talent almost seems to go hand-in-hand with becoming an experienced caver, and I seem
to be making steady progress in the latter area. I considered a number of different article ideas that
wouldn't require too much writing, but most of them were discarded before they were even born.
I reviewed several past Trogs for ideas that fit within my creative range, and saw many stories
that went along the lines of “my first cave trip” or “how a trip to such-and-such cave didn't go as
planned.” While I have nothing against people writing trip reports, I decided to write something a bit
different.
I had one interesting idea in which I planned to gather any songs written by VPI Cave Club
members, hopefully all in very poor taste, and publish them in the Trog for posterity. Brilliant! It
would require relatively no creative writing on my part and could give cavers something fun to sing
while trying to keep warm waiting at the bottom of a 90 foot pit. Unfortunately, when I queried the
cavers sitting nearest to me (John Echols and Sam Huff), they could only think of two songs: She's a
Goat and Cave On (which was already published by Nick Socky). Therefore, I gave up on that idea
for this article. However, if any reader finds John and Sam's knowledge of cave club lore lacking, I
would still love to publish a written record of VPI Cave Club folk songs.
I considered making a game (like count the penis-shaped objects in this drawing of a cave) or
publishing a few of my favorite recipes. At one point, I had firmly decided to write a short story about
misunderstood CHUDs (this would involve much more writing than I wanted, but would hopefully be
entertaining).
So what did I decide to do? So far it may seem like I'm merely rambling, but I assure you that
I'm also being self-indulgent and long-winded. If you haven't figured it out yet, I am writing about
trying to find something to write about, and I hope this article is sufficiently meta-VPI to be amusing
to at least a few people.
At the end of the day, I am writing this article because I enjoy caving, and most of the things
that go with it. Every caver has different reasons he or she enjoys caving, and while trying to under-
stand these reason may make for lively academic debate, I will not air my thoughts here. You should
go out and ask all the other cavers why they enjoy what we do. Who knows, you just might hear a
new, epic tale of overcoming adversity with insurmountable stupidity.
