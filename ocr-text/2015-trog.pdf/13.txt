My First Trip to WVACS
by Jeramie Clifford
A small group from VPI went to WVACS with our trusted Cave Pope Nick “Peppy” Socky for
a sport trip/rigging test for Andrew Lycas at Benedicts Cave. The VPI contingent consisted
of Nick Socky, Joe Calderon, Andrew Lycas, Tommy Cleckner, Gretchen Goeke Dee, Kel-
len Levinson, Connor Asbill, Jonathan Roberts, Kristy “Squeak” McCord, and Jeramie
Clifford. We left from Blacksburg early in the morning on a Saturday and drove to Benedicts
without incident, as it seems many cave club trips are wont to do. Upon our arrival at the
parking area for Benedicts, we had to trample down the four-foot-high grass in the changing
area to maintain the appearance of modesty should any of the locals turn their gaze upon
this coed group getting naked in the middle of a field. Once everyone had donned their gear,
checked their batteries, and compared their Wellies, we were off to the entrance.
Benedicts has several entrances. We entered through a small hole at the bottom of a de-
pression that drains into the main bore of Benedicts. This entrance is tight and full of
washed-in debris and crickets. I'm not a fan of the tight squeezes, and Squeak doesn't like
crickets, so this entrance was not well received, though it was mercifully short. The tight bit
opened quickly into the main bore and a meandering stream. From there, the goal was to
find a drop in the cave with bolts that Andrew could use for his rigging test.
Our intrepid leaders, Peppy and Joe, pulled out their maps and led the way. We followed dil-
igently down the bore, all thoroughly impressed by its size. Peppy insisted that if we thought
this was impressive, we should wait, because tomorrow at Bore Hole we would really be
amazed.
Eventually, Peppy and Joe once again consulted the maps and decided that the passage we
needed was just up ahead and to the right. We took a passage to the right, up and over a
large breakdown pile, and on through the passage as it got wetter and muddier (like a night
with Ballister's mother). The farther we went, the deeper and thicker the mud got. After
scrambling and trying to stay as dry as possible, I began to regret making fun of the Wellie
wearers. All the while contemplating if what looked like a high, small lead might have been
an alternate, dry route to our current glop walk.
The path diverged, and the stream choked into a narrow canyon. The only choice for us was
up and over a not-so-fun looking, slimy mud chute with a few crude steps tramped into
it. Joe and I scrambled up first and mustered on while the others had successively harder
times as each person ahead of them slimed the route up more and more.
Eventually, Joe and I came to what appeared to be an impasse of an amalgam of features
and flow stone, but we managed to squeeze through. Joe was sure the drop must be just
around the next bend. As we rounded the bend, the tunnel narrowed, and alas, there it was,
a lovely flow choke and the end of the lead.
