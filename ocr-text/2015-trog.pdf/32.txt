Attending Virginia Tech as a caver is one of the greatest things that every single student should appreciate with the short amount of time there. In some cases, especial- ly seen by the large contingent of the older members of the club, many return or just out right never leave. I have however fallen in the category of those who have to eventual- ly leave. But that of course does not mean you have to stop caving! It just becomes more difficult. After having moved up to the metropolis of Northern Virginia, I am at a location where it is a minimum drive of 3 hours to go caving. Blacksburg is four hours away from me, WVACs if four hours, Germany Valley is three, and Butler Mountain is three hours as well. And it sucks. But for me, I am lucky! Some people have to drive much further, five to six hours, in some cases eight. And you know what, they still do it! I know a caver who drives down from Massachusetts once a month to go to WVACS. That’s an eleven hour drive one way for him! I am impressed and shocked by his commitment, and learned not to whine about my inconvenience now. However that still doesn’t mean that after living in Blacksburg for four year, that it is easy adjusting. To cope with living further away, one of the steadfast rules I always try to follow is that “You must be underground for at least as long as you are on the road to get to said cave”. So If I am typically driving 3 or 4 hours to a cave, I have to spend at least 6 or 8 hours underground for me to justify the trip. And this is exactly what I do now! I do make exception to this rule if there is a party or “side event going on”, but I still try my hardest to at least get my head underground. Another thing I realized is that if I skip a weekend of caving, then I am just grumpy and the following week drags on. I guess you could call this hobby a drug in a way. So right now I have every single weekend for several months planned out with different caving activities. This of course is slightly different than being at VPI, because there you can just at the flip of a dime, head to a cave only 20 minutes away! But I guess this is just me rambling on about living away from cave country, so let me get to the point. All of this was me attempting to give some backstory to why I am sharing this article with you.
