Maxwelton - A Trip to the Other 'Bitter End'
By Nick Socky Photos by Nick Socky
Maxwelton Sink Cave, WV, was dug open in 2003 and the resurvey of the cave has been going
on for the past 11 years. Back in 2008, my Dad (Dave Socky), Ed Saugstad, and Errol Glidden along
with Larry Fisher, Gordon Cole, and Ken Hayes, went down stream in Cove Creek to survey passage
past Cascade Causeway and through Gasoline Alley. The survey was called the DEET survey because
of the chemical smell (probably very similar to why it was named Gasoline Alley). The survey was
cut short at DEET 17 near the beginning of Gasoline Alley because water levels were chest deep with
some swimming involved, and everyone on the survey was getting cold.
To note, the sump at the very end of Gasoline Alley is the lowest and furthest point in the cave and
very few people have been there. It is more or less Maxwelton's “Bitter End”.
Fast forward to 2014: my Dad was putting together a survey for a trip into Maxwelton! Wanting an
actual dry caving experience (as opposed to Dry Cave), I decided to join him. I was able to convince
Tyrone Philips, a VPI caver, into joining us by enticing him with the fact that the trip would also be
vertical. He later found out that my definition of vertical is still technically horizontal with annoying
12 foot drops that require gear.
Anyway, we found out at WVACs hours before the trip that we would be going to downstream Cove
Creek. I recall Errol Glidden making swimming motions and holding his breath as we drove away to
the cave. I was, however, banking on the fact that little rain this summer was going to give us a pleas-
ant, only knee deep survey.
After a short trip to Walmart because Tyrone forgot his boots (it has happened to all of us at least
once), we finally got to the cave. We had left my Dad at the cave to get suited up because it wouldn't
take us that long at Wally-World. So we hurried back, suited up, and as Tyrone and I got down to the
culvert, we saw my Dad's gear but he is nowhere to be seen. I slowly opened the culvert and yelled
down to see if he had fallen in. Luckily he had not. We had somehow snuck by him in my car. Reu-
nited, we all headed down into the cave.
The rest of the cave trip was pretty standard from here. This was Tyrone's first West Virginia cave, so
he was gawking at all the pretty formations in Heaven, and amazed by how big the passage was
(especially when we reached Cove Creek). As we travelled through the entrance series on our way to
Cove Creek, I suddenly realized that I had forgotten my micro rack! My Dad then remembered that he
had accidently left his eight down at the first drop and it should still be there, via a report by Niki Fox.
If it was not there, we would simply share gear. So we get to the drop and luckily, there is the eight
sitting off to one side! This definitely beats forgetting the instruments or the tape and having to cave
all the way back out and back in to continue the survey.
So we continued caving on. We got to the next drop in Cascade Causeway, found our way down to
Cove Creek again, scaled a few more small, but very pretty waterfalls, and we eventually got to our
first lead, at DEET-1.
