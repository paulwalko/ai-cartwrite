Note: there were a few spots on the way to this lead where the water got dangerously close to yodeling
depth, so I was beginning to get a little nervous about how dry our trip would really be.
To our dismay, the lead required additional climbing gear to get up. A bolt climb would be easy and I
heard recommendations of a grappling hook, but I personally think next time we come back I should
have my cave-quad copter operational so we could simply fly a rope up over a rig point. It is just the
logical thing to do!
With this lead unreachable, we put on some more layers, grabbed a snack, and then proceeded toward
Gasoline Alley. Ironically, to my earlier comment about forgetting survey gear, we in fact did forget
our second set of instruments. So, we just modified our survey team to the situation. I did front and
back sights, while Tyrone did lead tape with Disto, and my Dad sketched. From DEET-17 to the sump
was estimated to be around 1000 feet so we were looking at a long survey.
Immediately the water got deeper and right at our first station too! Luckily and surprisingly this waist
deep water was the deepest spot and wettest survey station. However, all of the following stations in-
volved lying on a mud bank with your feet in the water. There were no good places for stations, so
Tyrone proceeded to make slumping mud mounds on the ground to shoot off of. It worked, but I have
never gotten so much mud in my face and beard before. What really helped, though, was the Disto.
Our average shot length was right around 50 feet, with our longest shot of around 70 feet. So we just
continued to slither through the low ceiling mud and water, and eventually we got to the sump, or the
“Bitter End”. We did a few more shots, and my Dad nearly fell into the sump trying to see if the water
is low enough to keep going. The sump was deep, over your head in the middle of the pool. Howev-
er, it was determined that the water did go right up to the ceiling.
So we packed up and slimed our way back out of Gasoline Alley. Once out, we put on some drier
clothes, grabbed a snack, and headed out.
Nothing particularly eventful happened on the way out. Tyrone, being a VPI cave and poor college
student who couldn't afford a mechanical climbing rig, climbed the two drops on prusiks.
The slog back up through the entrance series, of course, felt much longer than on the way into the
cave.
We finally exited the cave around midnight for a 13 hour trip. This was a very productive trip: we fin-
ished off Gasoline Alley with 1101.47 feet of survey!
I do not know if I will be going back to this “Bitter End” but if anyone ever gets a chance to explore
the lowest point of Maxwelton, I would highly recommend it. This part of the cave definitely does
not get a lot of visitation, and I consider it quite an accomplishment to make it to the end.
There is still the high lead that needs to be climbed at DEET-1. When that gets finished, the resurvey
will be nearly complete (except for the huge lead list). It will still take a few years to complete the re-
survey of Maxwelton, but I hope to be part of the team that completes the potential 12 yearlong pro-
ject and see it through to the “Bitter End”
