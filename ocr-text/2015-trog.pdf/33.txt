Do not take your current living location for granted (or granite, if you like puns). I have realized how spoiled I was with living so close to some of the best caving in the east coast! And sadly wish I had taken advantage of it more while I was there. I am not only referring to just caving around Blacksburg, but also to all of those other neighbor- ing counties. I wish I could have explored more of Bland County, ventured into some of the Tazewell caves, or even travelled up to WVACS more often. And nothing is stopping me from doing this now. It is so much more of a drive for me to do them. Blacksburg is such a great central location to so many caves, and it is such a waste of your precious- ly small amount of time at Blacksburg, to keep going to the same caves over and over again. Do not waste the gift that has been given to you. On a final note, if and when you do leave Blacksburg, remember what the pur- pose of the VPI Cave Club is there for. Think of all the amazing people you meet, all the cool places and adventures you have been on. It doesn’t stop there! Becoming a part of VPI Cave Club also means you become part of the bigger picture of the caving world. There are grottos and caving organization throughout the USA and even the World! You should use those technical and social skills that you get from VPI to meet new cavers, explore new places, and have new adventures. While always remember- ing the great ones you had every weekend while at VT. VPI Cave Club sets you on a path to become a great caver and individual within the caving community, with the ability to continue learning and further your knowledge and skills. It also gives you some of the greatest friends anyone could ask for. The only thing worse then moving away from Blacksburg is if you let those potential connections and abilities go to waste. So do yourself a favor. Learn to appreciate Blacksburg and all of the caves while you’re there. Get all of your work done during the week so you can hit up the inner earth both Satur- day and Sunday. Don’t use being hung-over as an excuse to not explore some place new or old. And if and when you move away, find the local caving grotto and contin- ue to grow as a caver. Continue to cave on.
