I wandered around for some time, enjoyed the fire ring on the deck, listened to others recap
their day of caving (BTW, our glop was child's play according to a one woman ended up
stuck waist deep until she was helped out by friends), and helped Jonathan off to bed after
thoroughly hydrating. I went back to the remainder of our group and realized that it had got-
ten smaller. I had to remedy that. I went to the bunks and tried to wake some of our com-
patriots who had foolishly tried to sleep.
At this point, all information is third party; I don't remember shit! I apparently tried to wake
Kellen by climbing into her top bunk and whispering sweet nothings into her ear. I then de-
clared that I must be a good boy, promptly biting her shoulder and falling out of the bunk be-
fore retreating to the common room. I returned to reality in the common room with Andrew,
Tommy Polson, and a mason jar of moonshine. Tommy insisted that it would be bad form to
head to bed before it was finished. Not wanting to be in bad form, we oblige him. I some-
how found my bunk and turned in for the night. We had to be up soon to go to Bore Hole.
The next day was not good! I would rather have bed a cactus than open my eyes and face
that day! I was not a happy camper. I eventually decided that I needed to wake up and
purge myself of the evils of the night before. On the way to the bathroom, I heard Tommy
Cleckner ask â€œwho was that?' Apparently, I really looked like shit.
On my way back to my bunk, I begged off the Bore Hole trip and decided to go back to
Blacksburg early with Kellen, Collen, and Gretchen. After a short cat nap, a handful of advil,
and lots of water, I packed up left. As I alluded to earlier, the drive on cave trips are often
eventful, and the return trip was no exception.
I was already hating the world, Gretchen was not far be-
hind, and Kellen's GPS decided to bend us over. It decided
the best route would be over the curviest bits of Greenbriar
County and over the ass end of Mountain Lake. This route
did not agree very well with Gretchen's constitution, and we
had to stop several times to release some excess ballast.
We later found out that we were not alone in our hatred of
the world. Diana had to make several stops on the way to
the cave, Tommy Cleckner baptized the parking lot at Bis-
cuit World, and Jonathan had to turn over a rock or two in
the cave.
So all and all a great trip was had by everyone! I can't wait
to do it again!
