Safety Hazards of the Bowline with the Yosemite Back-off

Figure 1. Helical knot with a bowline and Yosemite back-off
The VPI grotto teaches the helical knot with a bowline using
the Yosemite back-off to climb rope for vertical caving shown in
Figure 1. Typically two knots are used for feet and a top ascend-
er. Alternatively, a top helical knot can be used in place of a top
ascender. I was climbing out of Pighole in the early spring of
2014 using knots, both for my feet and a top knot. I was climbing
tandem with another caver with me above to expedite the climb
out and we were making good time. About 20 feet from the top,
just before we got to the lip, the top bowline had cinched very
tightly to the helical making it really difficult to loosen and hin-
dered my progress. The knot didn't look like it should; rather, it
looked like what is shown in Figure 2. The knot had collapsed
and turned into a noose. The last bit of climbing was a struggle,
but once the lip of the pit was cleared I was able to climb the rest
of the way out fairly easily. So what happened to my top knot?
There are two different ways to tie the bowline with a Yo-
semite back-off. The difference depends on the direction the
working end goes around the main line. Figure 3 shows the incor-
rect way which allows the back-off to slide around the working
end. It looks very much like the correct way shown in Figure 4
with only slight differences that can be missed in a dark cave.
When I was climbing, I tied the knot the incorrect way and it
resulted in the knot capsizing and turning into a noose. After
some research, it turns out even when tied correctly the back-off
can rotate around the standing line and capsize resulting in a
noose. An example of the capsized knot is shown in the Youtube
video in Reference [2].

The same user who shows the capsize of the Yosemite
back-off offers an alternative back-off method shown in
the video [3]. This back-off method has not been tested as
stated in the video. The other alternative that I have been
aware of in the VPI grotto is to back-off the bowline with
an overhand knot. Another alternative published in 1988
presents a knot called the double bight bowline. This knot
is shown in Figure 5. The strength of this knot along with
three others was compared for 4mm, 6mm, and 8mm rope
given in Table 1. The strength of the double bight bowline
supersedes all other bowlines tested. The bowline with the
Yosemite back-off actually shows decreased strength
(although by a very minor margin) for the 6mm and 8mm
rope.
