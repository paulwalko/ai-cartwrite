As a bonus, here are the lyrics to She's A Goat by John Mulheren
(preferably accompanied by a ukulele):
Well me and my baby got a love so pure
I ain't never gonna ask for more
When I'm around her I ain't got nothin to fear
She likes it when I stroke her beard
My baby she does all the chores
but she's too short to open doors
She knows how to treat me right
Except for when she tries to bite
Chorus:
[Well she's a goat she's a goat and I love her dear
But I gotta get her drunk before she lets me near
I put a funnel in her mouth and pour the whiskey down
She looks so pretty when I put her in her gown
She's a goat she's a goat and I ride her like a bike
When I mount her I know what heaven's like
I make her say baaaaa and I make her squeal
Our goat human love is the real deal]
Well I made her my goaty bride
When the preacher saw us walkin he bout up and died
He said our love was an abomination
But he ain't never seen our copulation
My baby had a kid and it's easy to see
Looks kinda like her and looks kinda like me
I'll never forget the first thing he said
He said "I wish I wish I wish I was dead"
Chorus
