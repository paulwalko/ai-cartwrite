So, after arriving at yet another choke a few hundred yards downstream, we backtracked
upstream and climbed up into a nice, smooth bore just above the turn in the bend. We took
the slowly narrowing bore at a fast pace, enjoying the rush of moving quickly in a fun space,
and came to a 90 degree bend. Lo and behold, there were the bolts and drop, just where
Ferdinand and Magellan thought they would be!
Andrew rigged up a very nice, self-equalizing knot, and Joe rappelled down first. No one
died, Jonathan thoroughly enjoyed himself, and we all took some time to explore the room
we had dropped into. It was a massive room with breakdown the size of yachts and small
houses. It was pretty spectacular and eerie thinking of their transition from the ceiling to the
floor!
It was getting late, and we decided that we were losing drinking time. Knowing the correct
route, we made it back out in short order and hiked to the cars and then WVACS.
The real fun began once we got back to the WVACs station. We met up with Tommy Pol-
son and Diana, who were already there on separate trips. Once the group was washed and
fed, we stoked the wood stove and also put a little fire in our own bellies, courtesy of PBR,
Fireball, tequila, and maybe just a little moonshine. After perusing the maps on the walls,
we decided it was time for some table traverses. We were fairly successfully at the travers-
es and entertained those watching from the deck. Next came a few body traverses, which
had significantly lower success rates but were equally entertaining.
From here on out, I have to admit my recollection may not be entirely accurate or real...
Peppy decided it was a good time to rig the bolt in the common room and do a little vertical
practice. Horz need all the practice they can get! I found the best way to get a horizontal
caver to go vertical is by duct tapping a PBR to the top of the rope. I lent him a hand (well,
shoulders is a more accurate).
