TAG 2014
October 8th to 12th we celebrated the 37th annual TAG Fall Cave-In! A good portion of folks head-
ed down Thursday and got in late Thursday night to our usual spot on Blueberry Lane.
• BLUEBERRY LA.
On Friday, a large group of VPI spent the day rappel-
ling Little River Canyon in Alabama while others
drove down from Blacksburg, and some started the
party mid afternoon. Some others ventured off into
different caves in the area. Friday night is always
Karaoke night so naturally we danced and sang into
the night while other partook the other facilities
available.
• ONE WAY
PS
Saturday started with the annual Monkey
Butt Relief 5k at 8:00am. This year Sarah, John, and Nick participated in the run in the rain and if I remem-
ber correctly, someone ran it in his Chacos. That's dedication. VPI split into multiple little groups to go in
different caves. A popular cave was Tumbling Rock
cave in Alabama. A popular site to see while your in
the area is Unclaimed Baggage Center. Can't miss it! A
group also headed to Stephens Gap cave.
