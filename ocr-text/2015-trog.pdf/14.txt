I asked Joe if I should head back and stop the rest of the group before they had to negotiate
the last tight bits, but he said no, let everybody else enjoy the cave. So we pulled out our
lunches and began to eat while everyone else caught up. Andrew was the last to make it
through the pinch because he was hauling the rope for his rigging test.
By then, everyone had a chance to see the choke and know that it was not the right place
except Andrew, who Joe and Peppy directed to get to rigging. Andrew grabbed the gear
and headed down the tunnel toward the choke. As he rounded the bend and out of sight, we
all snickered a little. Then we heard a few choice expletives as Andrew realized he just
slogged all this way for naught and was going to have to backtrack through all the muck just
to find the right lead to get to the real rigging point.
Since we were thoroughly underground and trapped together, Tommy seized the opportuni-
ty to reach a captive audience and began to ask us if we had taken the Lord into our hearts
and seen the error of our hethenistic ways. I promptly responded, “Why yes, Jesus is my
belay.” As Tommy tried to convert the unworthy cavers, we tracked back toward the main
bore. On the return, I explored the high lead I speculated about earlier. To my delight, it
was dry, passable, and dropped me out just at the end of the glop walk. Once back into the
bore, our unflappable leaders pulled out their maps and proclaimed that this was just a
“teaching exercise" in finding our way.
Determining that we had overshot the correct lead, We went back up the bore and reached
what Peppy and Joe thought was the right lead. They decided to scout ahead to be certain
this time, and the rest of the group took a break. The group settled in and began to rehy-
drate and find a comfortable place to stand in the large passage. Someone decided this
would be a great time for total darkness. We continued to talk amongst ourselves as the
lights went out. After a few moments, I decided that this opportunity was too good to pass
up. I slowly walked toward Kellen in the dark as she talked, creeping along until I sensed
that she was only a step away. Then I gave her a jolt in the sides, and she almost jumped
out of her boots! I was thoroughly pleased with myself and moved on to my next victim.
Eventually, our dynamic duo returned and proclaimed that they had found the correct
lead. With a huge, shit-eating grin, Peppy said we weren't going to like it! We followed
them back to the new passage and quickly saw the reason for their grins: a low, flat, wide,
twisty passage of popcorn and sharp bits.
On the crawl through, Peppy and I discovered a grouping of small features very much re-
sembling a nativity. Tommy decided it was a positive sign and a blessing upon our
trip. Peppy handed his miter over to Tommy and proclaimed him the new Cave Pope, ha-
bemus papam!
The low, tight bit opened up to a nice valley down to a 40-foot-deep canyon and back up to
the next passage. Peppy and I bonded as we created a human barrier for our fellow cav-
ers. The passage emptied into a large, canyony bit in a bend in the stream passage, which
we had to climb down 15 feet and then decide upstream or down. Laurel and Hardy decid-
ed down was the right way. Can you guess which way was the right way?
