PICNIC
Picnic 2014 was another fun Pic-
nic in the books. We had beauti-
ful sunny weather that made it
all the more better. We also had
a great turnout. Thanks for all
who came and made it fun!
There was no threat of run-
ning out of beer at any
point. In fact, I think we end-
ed up with 1 keg untapped
and two half -empty! Some
say there were too many
lightweights but we know
that isn't true.
We also gained a new member
at Picnic. It was decided late
into the night, to vote Kelly
McCarthy in as VPI #442!
