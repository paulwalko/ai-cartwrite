Some caving, lots of drink-
ing, but I think one of the
most notable events of
this picnic was the memo-
rial service held for Pam
Mohr around the bonfire
Saturday evening.
It was a touching event as everyone lit
candles and carbide lamps at twilight
as they sang Amazing Grace.
All in all, it was another
great picnic for the
books!
