All made sure to make it back in time for the
fire. This is the hugest fire you will ever see and
the sheer height of it is amazing. This year they
had guys rappel down from the top and douse it
with gasoline before lighting. During the lighting
of it, fireworks spewed from the top for an
amazing show!
Lots of shenanigans happened between the two nights.
From a photoshoot with Highline, losing Peppy for a few
hours, trying to find Auburn, discovering the age of con-
sent in Alabama, stealing the crossing guard figure then
having to give it back then waking up Sunday morning
with it in camp. I'd say everyone had another great year
at TAG and can't wait until the next one!
