LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT
My dearest Cave Club,
My last action as leaving president is to write this letter to youâ€”you who have made my past year what it
was. It is a bittersweet time.
We did a lot together as a club this year.
We put tons work into our training program. We amended some bylaws that were getting a bit long in
the tooth. We worked on overhauling the Trainee Trog. We even redid the membership test. It's gratify-
ing to see the results of all of our work, and to not hear trainees whine about the Trainee Trog anymore.
(They all become suddenly satisfied with it when you send them a link to the Google Doc and tell them
to fix it themselves.) Now if only we could get those trainees to finally get their memberships.
We got access through the NSS to New River Cave, and it's quickly become our most popular caving des-
tination. Most recently, we just did an amazing job roughing out a trail to it. And I just found out we got
the grant for a kiosk and parking area! Under the stewardship of VPI and neighboring grottos, New River
Cave can only get better.
I was also excited to see the new Blacksburg Cave Rescue Group coalesce, and look forward to club mem-
bers being able to help with cave rescues in an official capacity. Likewise I was blown away by the
amount of work that was poured into SIVTAC's archive of club history. Looking through the old meeting
minutes gives perspective and shows that the more things change, the more they stay the same.
Through all of the caving that we did, the work we put in, and the speleo seminars we attended, I was
most impressed to see club members consistently volunteering and supporting each other. Everyone
who planned an event, led a trainee trip, or otherwise lent a hand is a fantastic person for doing so.
Altogether it's been an action-packed amazing year. Thank you for trusting me with presidency of the
club, and thank you for making the club what it is.
Best,
-Nikolaus
VPI Cave Club President,
School Year 2014-2015
P.S. Please direct all
complaints to current
President Tommy Cleckner.
