Straight dynamite is composed of mitroglycerine, wood pulp, and
sodium nitrate. The following equation is used to describe the com-
plete detonation:
2C3H5(NO3)3 + 6Naion + C6H1005 --- 9002 + 6N2 + 10H20 + 202 + 3Na 2003
The fume products often present quite a problem in caves. Dyna-
mite fumes consist principally are carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and steam
which are actually non-toxis; however, carbon monoxide and nitrogen
oxides may be present. This is why tür circulation in the blasting area
is desirable - especially if repeated blasts are made the same day in
the same place: "A small dynamite blaşt wan "fogh 1000‘feet of cave

To carry dynamite in caves a .30 or .50 caliber army ammunition
box is excellent. The box is mainly to prevent the cartridges from
