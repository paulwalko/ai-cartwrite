Fracture of the rock can occur through failure as a result of in-
ternal tension, compression, or shear stresses. Failure can occur most
readily by tension or shear. Consider the following example: two
equal charges are placed as shown on opposite sides of a Slab or rock
and detonated simultaneously.

Most of the resulting explosive forces contribute to internal com-
pressive stresses. A large amount of the explosive energy is used to
develop these stresses and is thus wasted. Failure may still occur as
a result; however, the following method is much more efficient.

In this method failure occurs more as a result of the shear and
tensive stresses than by compression and usually a greater amount of
fracturing will result. Delay firing of multiple charges can be used
to minimize the loss of efficiency through compression but this topic
is beyond the scope of this article. (See: Blaster's Handbook)
