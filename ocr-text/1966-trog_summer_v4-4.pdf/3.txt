EDITOR'S. COLUMN
With the publication of Douglas! Caves of Virginia, in 1964 more
and more Virginia caves were visited by cavers. Gradually, it was
realized that while many more caves were known to exist, descriptions
were not always accurate and information and maps not as complete as
they could be and should be. In some heavily limestoned areas, only
one big cave might be known. Many maps were hurried sketches, done
at a time when it was more essential to locate as many caves in an
area as possible, rather than to explore it in full detail..
While Douglas continued accepting information on Virginia caves
after the book was published, very little new data was turned in.
Cavers seemed. more interested in seeing already known caves rather than
discovering new caves and virgin passage. Soon, however, the era of
pioneer cavingll passed with people realizing that much more work had
to be done for full knowledge of Virginia's caves and cave systems.
In the spring of 1965, the Virginia Cave Survey project was
turned over to John R. Holsinger, presently of East Tennessee State
University. He worked to instili interest in this project with the
grottoes within the Virginia Region. - At that time only the VPI
Grotto responded with the most interest. The project was divided
into counties, with individuals taking one 'county or more. In Octo-
ber 1965, at the Virginia Region annual meeting, members of the VPI
Grotto were officially assigned to work in Bland, Craig, Pulaski,
Russell, Smyth, Tazewell, Washington, and Wythe Counties, with a
heavy involvement in the Butler-Sinking Creek System in Bath County,
and in Millers Cove Cave in Roanoke County: The University of Vir-
ginia Grotto took on Alleghany County, particularly the mapping of
Paxton's and Carter Caves and Gilley Cave in Lee County, while ..
Holsinger and his group from the University of Kentucky continued
their work in Lee, Scott and Wise Counties. Other individuals agreed
to take on small areas or caves in their own territory. This distri-
bution did leave, however, most of the northern Virginia counties un-
touched.
At the Virginia Region annual meeting of October 1966, a second
Virginia Cave Survey meeting was held. To the great surprise of this
editor, many more persons, representing the entire Region attended :
and were eager to push cave passages, many FRO'S (for record only) -
and map as many caves as possible. All the counties havo been assigned,
although some caves which need surveying are as yet unspoken for.
These are predominantly in Lee, Scott and Wise Counties which are
accessible only on long weekends.
As to the distribution of the work being done on the project,
VPI still retains the bulk of the counties. Unfortunately, there are
only two deeply interested persons with ability to initiate such trips;
one of which will graduate in December 1966. Holsinger himself con-
tinues to work in Lee, Scott and Wise Counties, and is gradually taking
