over the western part of Washington County. Phil Luces, an indepen-
dent caver in Staunton, Virginia, has volunteered to check leads in
Augusta, Bath, and Highland Counties. Members of the Roanoke Extension
of the U.Va. Grotto plan to check leads in Botetourt and Roanoke
Counties. Very fortunately, and I think to the surprise of many al-
reddy involved in the project, members of the George Washington Uni-
versity Grotto, in specific, Hugh Howard, have taken over the work in the
.northern Virginia, i.e., Clarke, Frederick, Page, and Shenandoah.
As a very interested member of this project, I am confident that
this particular work, under the directorship of Dr. John Holsinger,
will be ready for publication in 1990, as hoped,

AVAILABLE CAVE MAPS
Since Caves of Virginia was published in 1964, members of the VPI
Student Grotto have been preparing 'maps for a supplement to that book.
They have mapped a number of caves for the first time, and have remapped
others, presently appearing in the book, to include large previously un-
known portions of the caves. All surveys have been done with a Brunton
compass and tape. We would like to offer these maps to anyone who wishes
to purchase a copy, with the following stipulations. We must hold all
orders until there are enough to' warrant the cost of reproduction. Al
maps will be mailed folded and the cost will cover mailing charges. The
cost will be 50¢ per map with the exception of the Miller's Cove map at
$1.00. Send your order, along with your remittance, name and address to
