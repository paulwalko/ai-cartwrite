TRIP REPORTS
They journeyed to a side crawl which leads to a pendulum pit.
A fissure passage on the opposite side was reported to pinch out
after 150 feet. They crossed the pit and explored several hundred
feet of cave including some good-sized crawlways. But alas, Monday
morning classes once again caught up with us and we were forced to
drag back to "Bleaksburg" once again.
One month later (April 9-10) we eagerly returned with high hopes
of virgin passage. Our dreams were sustained in that we found a lot
of passage (1100 feet beyond the pit), but traversing it, much less
surveying it, was another story. We (Whitt, Rich, Cletus Lee and I -
linnie stayed outside and talked to cowboys) averaged only one hundred
feet per minute.
An interesting biological note: I spotted what I believe to have
been one of the famed long-eared bats (Plecotus townsendii virginianus),

When we entered the cave that afternoon, we saw what appeared to
be the remains of Ã  Roman orgy. Beer cans, paper, burnt logs, cinder-
blocks, flashbulbs, and even a crowbar littered the floor. All of
this being buried and removed, we proceeded into a short crawlway in
which I found an unique formation on three empty quart bottles.
The next room was not quite as badly littered but it was much
larger and trash collection was more difficult as the refuse covered
a larger area. . One corner appeared to be cave register complete
with Davy Crockett's carbide signature. Inspite of its marred con-
dition, the room was beautiful although some of the formations were
broken. We soon found out how they were broken.
Shortly, after the completion of cleaning this room, we met a
group of high school cavers. They showed us how not to keep a cave
beautiful. One of their party picked up a piece of breakdown and
knocked a formation from the ceiling for his collection". This
