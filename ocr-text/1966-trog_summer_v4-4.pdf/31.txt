"At least you'll be able to make a good closure," said Barry.
"'Holy humus, Barry, the Brunton is full of dirt!" I said. Sure
enough, where a magnetic needle once swang free, there was nothing
but soil under the glass.
i Holy cow, Whitt, let's go get a hamburger."
On our way by Mr. Klein's house, we stopped to ask him why he
had thrown away all those bottles.
''Never could fill them up," he explained. Ignorant landowners.
I had hoped that plotting out my survey notes would be apocalyptic,
but the plan became such an inexplicable conglomeration of superim-
posed loops, that I discarded them in disgust.
To settle my nerves, I decided to visit a small, easy cave. The
next weekend I found myself in 3-D Maze. Cave in Rockingham County.
On my way across the field, a farmer stopped me and asked if I had ever
been to. 4-Maze Cave. Perceiving that I had.encountered another farmer
of negligible intelligence, I asked, "Do you realize that three di-
mensions represent the three valid intergals of a point, the first
being a line, the second being a plane surface, and the third being
a solid figure?"
"Of course," he said, blankly.
Then how can there be a 4-D Maze Cave when such is beyond the
realm of physical reality?" I asked.
"See for yourself," he chuckled.
Hoping to prove the farmer wrong, I quickly located the entrance
and began to explore it. Anticipating a complex labyrinth, I smoked
an arrow onto the wall to point the way out. The arrow immediately
turned into the hand of a clock and began to revolve slowly. The
farmer was right. If I arrive at the arrows at the right time, they
will point out.
Holy Myotis, Barry, I'm sticking to Batcaves from now on!
