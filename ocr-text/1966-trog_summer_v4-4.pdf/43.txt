The next day Ray and I decided to try to explore past the fifty
foot pit that we had seen the night before. We, therefore, carried
the cable ladder into the cave. The others planned to finish mapping
the trunk passage. Ray and I crossed the pit by climbing twenty feet
down the ladder, swinging to a smaller pit forming in the side of the
larger one, and chimneying up the smaller one. At the top, we were
greeted by one of the cave's few formations. This passage leads
straight back seventy feet to a passage leading to the right. This
side passage is a three hundred foot, mud-filled crawl trat ends in
breakdown. The rest of the cave is over a mud partition to the left
of that main passage. There we found a dome pit with a large opening
twenty feet up its wall. To the left of the dome pit is a fissure
that we crossed to another mud partition. On the other side of the
partition there is a sharp decline to a hole. This hole along with
the fissure leads to a lower passage twenty to thirty feet below that
level. Over the hole, Ray and I chimneyed up twenty feet to an upper
lead. This lead is a winding passage that progresses from a walking
to a crawling passage and ends in a small room. After that Ray and
I joined the others, and we returned to VPI.
