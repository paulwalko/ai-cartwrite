RESCUE?!
Recently three members of the VPI Grotto planned a fake cave res-
cue, independent of the olub, for the purposes of providing the club,
as a whole, some first-hand experience in a rescue situation. Con-
trary to conservative thought, most of the members were not informed
that it was practice.
Old Mill Cave, about five miles from VPI, consists of less then
1000 feet of stream passage. A fifteen foot crawl yields the en-
trance room and a very tight squeeze leads to the stream. About 500
feet upstream is a siphon, near which I was to have fallen and "pulled
a ligament in my leg". Jack Keat and myself went into the cave with
my sleeping bag and George (Stoney) Stonikinis rolled around in the
entrance room to get wet and muddy. Stoney then drove back to Tech
and arrived at the meeting about ten minutes after it had started.
He said that I was hurt in Old Mill and that he had taken a sleeping
bag to me. The meeting was eventually adjourned and less than 50
minutes later 16 people were entering the cave with six more outside.
Three people were told that the rescue would be a fake (two on the
inside and one on the outside of the cave) and one pretended to call
a doctor before they left for the cave. He had also reminded everyone
of the Catawba Murder Hole incident and told everyone not to call
for any assistance as it was not needed, nor was the publicity that
goes with it,

.
Meanwhile back in the cave, Jack and I decided to save them 100
feet of passage by saying that we had gone part way but I then became
too exhausted to help. I purposefully became thoroughly wet and
was uncontrollably shivering when the first group arrived. As there
are no dangerous places in the cave, many thought that it was a joke
until they saw me shivering. As I had only gotten under my sleeping
bag, I was ably placed in it (actually it was placed around me) and
I was carried most of the way with it on me. I was carried by teams
at times, and passed over bodies at other (tighter) times. At the
tight spot the sleeping bag was removed and I was pulled through.
We waited in the entrance room for all to catch up among jokes and
singing by the members of the rescue team. It was at this time that
most of my worries about inconveniencing many people were dispelled
due to the joviality of the group at the time. The twenty feet out
were easy and Jack then announced that it was only practice. The
500 feet were covered in less than 13 hours..
A few constructive obsevations: the club did very well, both
in assembling and carrying out the rescue, but it was under ideal
conditions, i, es, short cave, time not stressed, no cuts or fractures.
no drops or traverses, and the club was already assembled when the
accident was announced Even so I believe that the club was just as
capable should these adverse conditions arise.
Although it was often mentioned by many members of the rescue
