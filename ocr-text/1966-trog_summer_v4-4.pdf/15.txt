For most practical applications in cave blasting, the optimum
fracture area for a cubic foot of rock is roughly 11,500 square feet.
From this the total fracture area can be easily calculated for the
volume of rock which is to be blasted. For example, for two cubic
feet it is necessary to produce (2x11,500=23,000) square feet of frac-
ture area; for one-half cubic feet the total fracture area would be
(2xll,500=5750) square feet. This relationship is somewhat arbitrary,
however, for most situations encountered in cave blasting it is accu-
rate enough when used to calculate contact charges confined by a mudcap.
The following equation can now be used to describe the relation-
ship between explosive and rock. It can be used to calculate the quan-
tity of a particular explosive necessary to blast a given type and
quantity of rock. Data has been presented for the common dynamites and
the rock that is most often found in caves.
P = fA
2000E
P=number of pounds of explosive,
f=fracture energy of rock.
A=total fracture area of rock to be blasted.
E=explosive energy of dynamite.
The application of this equation is relatively easy but it should
not be used as a substitute for common sense when calculating the charge
size. One of the best methods for practicing blasting is to set up an
experiment with small iblasting problems". I would strong ly suggest
practicing the basic techniques above ground, say in an abandoned
quarry, before trying them in a cave.
Example Problem
How much 60% dynamite applied as an external charge is needed to
blast three cubic feet of limestone?
Solution:
la = 3x11,500 = 34,500 sq. feet, total fracture area.
f = 208 foot-pounds/sq. feet, fracture energy for
limestone.
E = 800 foot-tons/pound of explosive, explosive
energy for 60% dynamite.
P = ? pounds of 60% dynamite required.
Substituting in the equation:
P = fb/2000 E
P = (208 ft-lb's/ft2)(34,500 ft2)
T2000 lbs/ton)(800 ft-tons/Ä«b of explosive)
P = 7.176 x 100) 1.6 x 106 lbs.
P = 4.5 pounds of 60% dynamite.
