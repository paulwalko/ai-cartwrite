the open face. Since rotary power drills are not normally available
in most caves, other methods of confining the charge are necessary.
A small hole can usually be made in the gravel and clay fill. Further
confinement can sometimes be accomplished by placing a heavy rock over
the charge or by mudcapping. The efficiency of the blast is greatly
increased by confining the charge.
Another common obstacle is the boulder. There are two common
methods used to eliminate boulders:
(1) Snakeholing Method -- A small spade can be used to dig a
hole beneath the rock large enough to pack the dynamite under and
against the rock. The charge must be in aontact with the rock in
order to break it. DuPont recommends two 13"x8" cartridges per foot
of thickness at the point opposite the charge; however, thick rocks
will need more dynamite per foot of thickness than thin ones. The
more solidly the charge is packed against the rock the greater the re-
sulting force against it. When it is necessary to use several car-
tridges in a composite charge, it is best to slit them open and care-
fully tamp the charge into place with a wooden stick. But remember:
caps are sensitive, so don't ever tamp the primer charge. It should
be carefully placed in the hole last and not opened. The primer car-
tridge consists of a dynamite cartridge primed with a blasting cap.
When the primer charge has been placed, sand or moist clay should be
placed over the charge and pressed down lightly. After the charge is
covered by several inches, the remainder of the hole should be firmly
packed with additional sand, clay, or mud.
(2) Mudcapping Method -- Mudcapping is usually the most prac-
tical method for "boulder breaking" in caves. The cartridges are
placed on the boulder in close contact with each other and covered
with a three- or four-inch layer of mud. According to DuPont, the con-
finement provided by the mud reduces the amount of explosives required
by about 25%. Thick, pucky cave mud works very well. But, again,
skill in placing the charge is just as important. It is usually not
too difficult to recognize the bedding planes on a limestone or sand-
stone boulder. Dynamite is quite effective if the cartridges are
placed with their axis parallel to the bedding plane.
Irstantaneous firing: multiple charges
.
Quite often it is necessary and practical to detonate two or
more separate dynamite charges at the same moment. For example,
several small charges properly placed on a particulare boulder and
detonated instantaneously are usually more effective than an equal
amount of explosives applied as a single charge. A detonating fuse
called primacord is used to accomplish this. Primacord is composed
of a high-velocity explosive contained in a fabric or plastic cord
which resembles 3/16" clothesline. The separate charges are primed
