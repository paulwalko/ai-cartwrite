Priming Dynamitei .
There are several common methods used to insert the cap into the
dynamite cartridge. The easiest way is to punch two holes in the
cartridge and lace the fuse. This method is good because no tape is
needed (See figure 1). A pencil makes a good dynamite punch. Remem-
ber: nitro headaches are bad. Wear gloves.

Now we can proceed to something a little more useful: the appli-
cations of explosives to cave making. By now it should be obvious that
merely detonating dynamite is a simple sort of thing and it's only a
little more complicated than setting off a firecracker; however, the
true art of blasting is the skill with which the charge is placed. The
whole idea of cave blasting is to move an obstruction or fracture it so
that it can be moved by hand. If the charge is placed improperly, the
blast may just make a lot of noise.or, at the same time, it may make
the obstruction more permanent. A bad choice of explosives can give
similar results. Because of so many variables it is impossible to
state with certainty exactly how much dynamite is required to move or
fracture a given quantity of material. There are three things to con-
sider: (1) choice of explosive, (2) quantity of explosive, (3) place-
ment of the charge.
With these things in mind let's consider some hypothetical prob-
lems. One of the most common obstructions is a sand, clay, and
gravel fill. In a situation such as this it is necessary to loosen
or move material rather than to break it. For such a problem a low
velocity explosive is more practical, i.e., 30% dynamite. If the fill
is small, say about three cubic feet, one cartridge properly placed
will probably be enough to loosen it so that it can be removed by hand.
The secret of placeing the charge so as to take advantage of the
resulting explosive force is confinement, In mining applications, this
condition is fulfilled by using drill holes and loading them with ex-
plosives. Because of the confinement, failure of the rock occurs along
