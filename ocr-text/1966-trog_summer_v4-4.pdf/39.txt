linne Whittemore, R.E. Whittemore, Barry Whittemore,
Rich Johnson.
The purpose of this trip was to complete the mapping of Ward
Cove Cave.
We left the VPI campus about 1:30 Saturday afternoon, and ar-
rived in Thompson Valley at about 5:00 p.m. Whitt decided we had a
little time to kill before going to Ward Cove, so we went searching
for the Lost Mill Caves.
The car was parked on the road near the location of the caves.
From there, the five of us went treking over the nearby hills, poking
in little holes and running from bulls. After about an hour of this,
Barry and I stumbled onto this tremendous sinkhole about 75 feet deep
and 100 feet in diameter. We were attracted to this direction by the
sound of a large volume of water rushing by at an enormous pace. The.â€œ
The water was flowing from the cave through the sink and down into a
siphon pool.
Meanwhile, Whitt, inne and Rich had found Lost Mili #3 which had
a stream flowing in the direction of Lost Mill #1.
dit this point, we decided to get started toward Ward Cove Ar-
riving at the cave a little after dark, we carried our gear up to the
"kitchen" area in the entrance. lt 8:00 we started caving. After
crossing the pit area near the entrance we ran down the "freight :
train" passage to a side passage which Earl Thierry said ended in a
slit 150 feet from a fifty-foot pit.
Four of us (excluding Anne) rappelled some 30 feet down the pit
and swung over to a small Ledge. From here we began to map some 200
feet of a side passage. After mapping the side passage, we explored
the rest of the other passage. On the previous mapping expedition
the upper level of the passage had been explored, but the lower level
was Ieft virgin. On this trip, however, it lost its virginity.
Since it was getting late and we were getting hungry, we decided
to call it a night. We crossed the pit by swinging out on a cable
ladder which we had previously rigged. From here we proceeded back to
the entrance and ate supper.
When we finished supper it was 12:30. We went to bed, determined
to get an early start the next day. We managed to get up the next
morning around 8:00 and had breakfast By, the..time we started mapping
again it was 10:00.
