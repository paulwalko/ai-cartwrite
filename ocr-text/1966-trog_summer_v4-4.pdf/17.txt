STEELE'S CAVE, TAZEWELL COUNTY, VIRGINIL
9
Steelers Cave, within the town Limits of Tazewell, Virginia, is
found twenty feet from the road on property owned by the County
Poor Farm. The cave is at an elevation of 2600 feet in the side of
a rounded limestone ridge.
The cave was briefly discussed in McGill's "Notes on Undeveloped
Caves on Virginia", NSS Bulletin, No. 8, July, 1946, page 6. He
noted that it is in Beekmantown limestone, Dr. Byron Cooper, . .
presently head of the Department of Geology, Virginia Polytechnic
Institute, mentioned the cave in his section on underground drainage
in Geology of the Burkes Garden Quadrangle, 1944.
A Brunton and tape survey was made on the cave by inne, Barry,
and R.E. Whittemore, J. Craig Peters, Tom Roehr, Ray Womack, Bob
Simonds and Roy Clark. The work was completed in two trips during
the fall of 1965. With all the data assembled, the cave was found
to have 1500 feet of passage with three distinct levels, making the
map somewhat difficult to draw.
With regard to regional geology, the cave is in the Tennessee
River watershed, but close to the watershed divide between the
Ohio(New) and Tennessee(Clinch) Rivers. In one instance, at Gratton,
the divide is about 47 miles to the northeast while the divide is
only 2 miles to the southeast at the source of Little Creek on
Rich Mountain. The limestone in which Steelers Cave is developed
dips 42° NNW, while the strike parallels the mountains, which run WSW.
The cave is middle-aged, being located in a fairly mature karst
area. It is near the surface; for the most part it is high above
the water table and is quite dry. The deep pools, at the ends of
the northern-most developed passage, are at the water table. These
pools mark a culmination of cavern development in the cave, and are
unlike any features found in the rest of the cave. There are no
flowing streams within the cave at present; in fact, any water which
enters the cave (usually overflow of the nearly surface stream) sinks
immediately. The water in the pools does not appear to be flowing,
although it would seem that the water would be moving toward the
Clinch Riyer one mile away at Burkes Garden Station.
A small unnamed stream is shown on the Burkes Garden topographical
quadrangle as flowing past the cave entrance. On both trips we saw
no water in this stream. According to Cooper, this stream once
flowed into the cave and came out one-quarter mile away. This, i
feel, is not true, because the abandoned stream channel in
the cave is above the present entrance. It is more likely that a
stream from within the cave on the upper level fed the surface
stream, and as a result of further downcutting was pirated to the
lower cave level and abandoned the surface stream. This would apnea
to be the case since the lover level is below the entrance. Ille
stream features are almost non-existent in this lower passego nero
the entrance so as to lead one to believe that the passage did not
serve as a water channel for very long, for water found easier t275
to reach the water table.
