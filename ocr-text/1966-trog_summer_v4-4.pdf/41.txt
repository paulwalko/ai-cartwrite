TRIP REPORTS
COON' PIT :
7/30/66
by George Stonikinis :
Personnel: Gene Harrison, Jim Weeks.
We investigated a pit approximately 1500 yards. due west of Coon
Cave, on the side of the second hill beyond the farmer's house. It
consists of a 45 foot chimney leading to a room six by twelve feet.
Several salamanders and cave bugs were found. The entrance is -
usually covered by brush and several logs. We were not the first to
have entered it.

WARD COVE CAVE
21/21/65, 3/5/66, 4/8/66
by Barry Whittemore.
::. "A high arched entrance leads to 1300 feet of explored passage.
This is a huge cave with great possibilities. There are several un-
explored leads. Ladders and ropes are necessary." (Earl Thierry,
Caves of Virginia, p. 530).
Once again the team of Whittemore, Whittemore, and Whittemore,
Brunton and tape in hand, were drawn to the wild unknown of south-
Western Virginia.
- On November 21, 1965, after a group of us had finished surveying
Steelers Cave, we decided to have a look at the fabled Ward Cove Cave,
The cave was easily found and in less than an hour we had run through
all of the previously m√°pped area and were out again, our appetites
whetted for our next trip to Tazewell County,
On March 5th and 6th, 1966, Whitt, innie and I set out to survey
the cave. We mapped across the easy entrance pit and turned left on
the main channel (previously unmapped) where we picked up 700 feet of
walking and easy crawling, passage which ended in breakdown, We then
resurveyed the remaining 1300 feet of running passage. One of the in-
teresting features of the tunnel is that while it is basically
straight, the passage winds from side to side between eight-foot high
banks of gray mud. This compound looks reharkably like weathered
stone until one tries to climb it. This section is terminated by a
rainwell and a pool. A narrow fissure heading into this room contain,
same f the finest pucky mud I've ever seen; it's great for putting
out Gremlin Lamps,
While the Terrific Trio was hard at work with the Brunton and
tape, the two other members of the party - trainees Ray The Mighty
Midget! Womack and Rich Johnson - were given a rope and ladder so
that they might do some exploration work on their own.
