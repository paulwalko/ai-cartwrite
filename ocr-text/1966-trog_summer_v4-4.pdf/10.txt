by lacing one or two cartridges in each charge with primacord and
then detonating the primacord with a blasting cap. The detonation
velocity of primacord is about 21,000 feet per second, so the result
is essentially instantaneous: tho cap detonates the primacord which
in turn detonates the dynamite charges.

The use of primacord makes possible a number of very effective
blasting techniques but there are a few tricks that should be used if
you want to get good results:
(1) The detonation of primacord is quite often unpredictable;
sometimes it is unidirectional. For this reason don't place the blast-
ing cap in the middle of a primacord line connecting two charges. Al-
ways prime it about six inches from an end and always point the closed
end of the cap in the desired direction of detonation. The cap is
simply taped parallel to the primacord with electrical or adhesive tape.
(2) The separate charges can be connected to a single primacord
trunk line which can be detonated at one end. There are several knots
which can be used to make connections with a trunk line. In principle,
a knot which provides sufficient surface area and close contact between
two lengths of primacord is good; however, the following are recommended:
. (a) clove hitch - for connecting branch line to trunk line.
(b) square knot way for splicing two lenkths of primacorr,
Directions on how to tie these two rare, complicated knots are
left to individual research by the reader.
