Primacord techniques are very effective when applied to chock-.
stones or when blasting through massive breakdown. For example, con-
sider the following problem - a chockstone.

The size and thickness of the rock will determine the size of the
charge to be used. The most effective method would be to apply two sep-
arate charges as shown in figure 3, and detonate with primacord by using
the techniques previously illustrated. A common mistake would be to
place only one charge. This may work, but chances of success are smaller.
Blasting through breakdown can be rather complicated and it is some-
times a very dangerous undertaking. 'Removing the keystone's" with explo-
sives is very effective but it is somewhat hazardous. Multiple charges
placed at strategic points and connected with a primacord system is
probably the best technique.
Other common obstructions often encountered are speleothems in the
form of stalactites, stalagmites, and calcite flowstone. Because of
the physical properties of calcite, it is relatively easy to fracture
with a high velocity explosive. À contact charge and mudcap is gener-
ally the most effective method. Primacord techniques are sometimes ap-
plicable but they are usually not essential. The best way to break
small stalactites is with a hammer. Explosives are extremely effective
when used to eliminate small stalactites, but it's not quite "sporting".
Large stalactites, or fat stalagmites can be removed with a fairly small
contact charge of dynamite provided the cartridge is in good contact:
with the formation. This can be accomplished by bending the cartridge
to conform with the surface and applying a mudcap.
