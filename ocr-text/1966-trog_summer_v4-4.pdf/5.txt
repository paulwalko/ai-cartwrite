THE FINE ART OF CAVE MAKING
OR "HOW TO MAKE NOTHING OUT OF SOMETHING
Everyone has, at onc time or another, been charving down the
":, new, vir in.-type passage and found himself suddenly face to
face with a huge impassable pile of breakdown, an impossibly tight
crawl, or some other obstruction that quickly terminates exploration.
It is true that the cave has to end somewhere but more often than not,
it continues beyond the obstruction. Caves were not ma e for people;
most of them don't even have entrances.
There are several solutions to the problem. Most people would ut-
ter Iuul language or perhaps just cry quietly. I've watched some of
the even more primitive types even try digging. Aside from being gen-
erally unpleasant, digging usually takes a lot of time. The first thing
to do is light a cigarette. Don't try to enjoy the cigarette - the idea
is to make some smoke. Settle down and watch the air movements. If the
smoke curls in quiet circles above your head and if non-smoker type
cavers near you begin coughing, you may have reached the "end"; but, if
the smoke zooms into a small hole in the breakdown, chances are that
there is a big cave' beyond. If the air is blowing out of the hole,
the prediction is still true. Now, of course, the air may actually be
blowing in or out of another entrance, but the idea is that the air is
going (or coming) from somewhere.
If the obstruction is fairly small and easily moved, digging is
probably more practical, but there is a limit to what you can move by
hand. : Where digging becomes impractical, there is a better way: Explosives.

The first thing to consider about explosives is safety. Explosives
are inherently dangerous things to handle; however, these dangers aan
be minimized by a thorough knowledge of safety precautions, handling
procedures, and techniques involved. There are a lot of very important
rules. Only a few that apply to cave blasting will be mentioned here.
I would strongly suggest that anyone who is seriously interested in
learning about explosives, handling procedures, etc., obtain a copy of
the Blaster's Handbook, which is published by E.I. Dupont De Nemours
and Co., Explosives Department, Wilmington, Delaware. The price is
five dollars, but it is well worth the investment,
A word of Caution: Don't attempt to use explosives (in caves or
otherwise) without first becoming familiar with the proper techniques
and procedures involved.
There are hundreds of different types of explosives on the commer-
cial market. Of the dynamites, several of the more common types are
very useful in caves. Dynamites are rated in strength according to the
percentage of nitroglycerine by weight which they contain. The two
types most commonly available are 40% and 60%. Power and energy con-
cepts can be rather misleading when applied to explosives. For example,
60% dynamite is not twice as strong as 30%. The stength of dynamite
refers to its energy content, which in turn, determines the force and
