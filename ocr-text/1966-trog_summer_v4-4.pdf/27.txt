team, my head was often not supported. It is quite tiring and de-.
moralizing for the victim to support his own head.
Another problem I encountered was a lack of a situation during
which I could relieve my bladder. The natural processes of the
victim should be remembered.
Another consideration, should it be a long trip out, is wet clothes
on the victim..
My thanks to the club for coming after me. Although I heard of no
conflicts (we even had our famous Forgyll afterwards) I am sorry
for any inconveniences which developed. I believe that the trip did a
good deal towards accomplishing its purpose, even though I would not
recommend this method of realism in most situations,
