· Structurally, the cave is of a chopped-up solutional development.
As discussed above, the upper level once served as a stream channel with
its mouth near the entrance. The lower level was, meanwhile, being de-
veloped below the water table. Faulting occurred in the phreatic zone
which for some reason did not affect the upper level, but only the middl.e
section of the lower level. Piracy of the upper level stream occurred,
perhaps via the connection between the two levels (see map). At this time
the water table dropped, and the phreatic fill in the lower level was
cleared out by solutional means. The floor of the lower level is the
floor of the fault; its dip is 24.0 as compared to the bedding planes (see
figure 1).
The main lower level is rectang-
fault
ular with two parallel passages about
45 feet away from each other and being
connected only in two places. The
floor of these passages is the footwall
of the fault and dips at 24°. The big
room above the pools is composed of. ,
rectangular slabs and ends at the first
parallel passage. On either side of
this large : passage are small passages
formed along joints. It is interesting
to note these small passages have no
counterparts on the other side of the
loarge passage, which is also the other
side of the fault.

. With regard to detailed cave description, the upper level begins
near the entrance as a wide keyhole with a flat floor in the side of the
entrance room. A small upclimb is necessary about 30 feet: past the en-
trance before continuing. Near the end, the passage becomes an inclined
canyon dipping at 430 (see figure 2). A side passage from the upper level
going in a southwesterly direction comes into the lower passage above a
pile of breakdown. The connection is steep and slippery; it is not the
easiest way to get to the lower level, but is quite direct. There are
many formations in the upper passage, and the entrance rimstone covers
the floor.
From the entrance, the lower
level, i.e., the fault-fractured
section and the connecting passages,
can be reached by two winding crawl-
ways. The narrower one is rocky-
floored and sinuous coming into the
main lower level near its connec-
tion with the upper level (see map). ..
The wider crawlway enters the slab
room about six feet above it on the
western end. Crossing the slab room,
one can get to the second parallel passage by either chimneying about 80
feet above the pools or by a southern connection over breakdown and mud.
The second parallel passage is unlike the first in that its floor is mud-
covered and is inundated with pits. A small hole at the top of this one-time
