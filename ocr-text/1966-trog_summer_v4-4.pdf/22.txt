There is still good possibilty for more passage in Piddling
Pit and Canis Major. The stream flow and standing water in both
caves are most interestin. Information on these caves (and others)
can be obtained from Niel Albaugh (NRAO), Gary Bream (Drexel),
Mike Byorie (Ga. Tech.) or myself (VPI) at the NRAO at Green Bank.

VPI Grotto Banquet, 1966
The night of March 12, 1966, the VPI Grotto held their first annual
Grotto Banquet which was coordinated by Ed Bauer. It was held at
the University Club near our campus, conveniently located so that
most of the Grotto meml;ers could attend. A purpose of this social
event was to bring back many of the grotto's old-timers of which there
are many. Unfortunately, only a few came, all of whom we were glad
to see.
The banquet began at 6:30 p.m. with 65 persons being served.
After dinner, we retired to the basement of the Hall for entertainment
The Hall was decorated to give a cave atmosphere, complete with the
Cave Club's own mascot, The Troglodyte. John E. Cooper, our guest
speaker, was presented with a large brush (presumbably for brushing
his now nonexistent beard) by the Mistress of Ceremonies, Anne
Whittemore. John then gave us an informative and colorful slide
show of his travels through Cuba looking for salamanders and other
reptiles and, occasionally, visiting caves. We enjoyed his show
a great deal, and were pleased that he was able to come.
Some of the old-timers present were Stan Carts, Ackie Loyd,
Ed Day, Bill Biggers, and Lew Bicking, The door prize was given
to Doug Yeatts of VPI, after Martha Cooper pulled his name from a
bag. He was awarded a gigantic carbide lamp and helmet assembled
by Tom Vigour and Paul Helbert.
To conclude the entertainment, R.E. Whittenore presented the
VPI Grotto Annual Achievement Awards and Guano Clusters aided by
Sandy Bell and two guitarists, John Eads and Jack Keat. Guano
Clusters were distributed to notewotthy individuals as follows:
Ackie Loyd, as a past president of the Grotto; Ed Day, for being
the original instigator devoted to ridding the club of the now-
extinct leadership system; Bill Biggers, known well for his genorousity
in getting VPI cavers out of harrowing jams with his Magic Coat;
Lew Bicking, for his act in almost eliminating three prominent
VPI Cavers in a flooded cove one year, and lastly, to John Cooper,
for being present,
