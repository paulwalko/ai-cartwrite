Military explosives and demolitions such as TNT, composition C-3
and C-L1 are the ultimate in sophisticated high-velocity explosives.
Composition C-4 is so effective that it could best be described as
"instant cavell; however, since these explosives are very difficult to
obtain they will not be discussed any further. (See: Explosives and
Demolitions, U.S. Army Field Manual FM5-25).
"Sifon-Go" is too dangerous to be used in caves so this topic
will be dismissed also. (See Tech Troglodyte; Vol. 4, No. 2, page 60-1).
Since a good technical caving article is not complete without a
few hairy equations, several will be presented here. The mathematics
are not included to decorate this article or snow the reader. The
following analysis is useful as a qualitative method for determining
the approximate amount of explosives required to blast a particular
rock. But since the conditions are ideal, it should be considered as
Advanced Theoretical Cave Making.
The energy or work that a given explosive is capable of producing
at detonation is usually stated in foot-tons per pound of explosive.
The characteristics of any detonation are determined by the manner in
which a given volume of explosives (at relatively low temperature)
changes to a large volume of gas (at a high temperature). The total
work, assuming no heat loss, is determined as;

where V=volume, p ressure. However, since the process is not adiabatic
the following data has been determined on this basis. The preceding re-
lationship is interesting but an understanding of it is not essential.

The amount of work necessary to cause fracturing of a rock mass is
determined by the number of foot-pounds per square foot of fracture
area required. The fracture area (after detonation) should not be con-
fused with the surface area (before detonation).
