The Achievement Awards are given annually to members of the Grotto
to commend them for their actions during the past year. This year's
presentations were well-selected, with a song and/or speech and a
small gift accompanying each award. For instance, the John Holsinger
Vertical Caver award was given to John Peduzzi, honoring his confusing
and somewhat annoying experiences in Sites Cave and Clover Hollow
Cave. He was presented with a three-runged rope ladder to use in fu-
ture jams. Paul Helbert was given the Tim Schoechle Give-Up-Caving-
and-Go-Climbing Award. For his gift, Paul received an ice piton.
Drip, drip. The Sam Dunaway Grubby Caver Award went to Tom Vigour
(who else?). Tom was given a bar of soap and a razor blade so that
someone else will have a chance to compete for the award next year!
Given a megaphone so that people will hear his trip reports more
easily, Bob Simonds received the Joseph Overman Outstanding Trip
Report kward for the shocking report of a trip to Aunt Nellie's Hole
during which local ruffians bombarded the cave with cherry bombs.
The Gregg H. Marland Award for Leadership went, for the second year,
to Ed Bauer. With a red, lit cherry bomb in his hand, Ed remembered
a trip to Aunt Nellie's Hole several weeks previous. The award left
Bob Simonds, Cletus Lee, Gary Scofield, and Larry Wuensh quite
astounded.
Who should be honored with the Ed Day Driving Award, but Jim
Cooper. Seems he received a $105.00 speeding ticket in Carroll County,
Virginia. Whitt" presented him with a Driving Rules & Regulations
Manual for the State of Virginia. The Roger T. Eubank Most Dedicated
Caver tward went to Tom Roehr who bravely hiked all the way to Aunt
Nellie's Hole one bitter day in the snow and wind. Tom was pleased
to accept a mud piton. The Dan Meier Equipment Award was given to two
people this year. First to Gene Harrison, for his remarkable second
light source (VPI Spotlight) attached permently to his hard hat brim.
Someone swiped the valuable hardhat and placed a candle on the other
side of the brim so that Gene now has three light sources on his hat.
The second person to receive this award was Hank Harjes, who worked
with great deligence to develop a cave radio. His efforts were
properly rewarded by his gift: two cans tied end-to-end with a
string. The Wayne Elliot Sex Award was given to Jack Keat for his
activities at the February 1966, Virginia Region Council Meeting.
He received a large pair of female unmentionables. Rick Keener
qualified for the Mason Sproul Cave Disaster Award. He received a
Guano Cluster which should remind him of his part in the Catawba
Murder Hole debacle. This year the Mike Youso Jewish Caver Award
went to Craig Peters who, in order to save the club money, insisted
on slanted eyes for the ape on the Grotto patches.
So comes to an end, the first Annual Banquet. All those who
helped make the event a success are indeed, thanked. We all adjourned
to the home of Roberta and Hank Harjes for a branewpardy. Peace.
