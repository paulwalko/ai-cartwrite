Certainly, it is a cave to see when you are in Tazewell County,

PIDDLING PITY
of
us
Piddling Pit is on the east side of Cloverlick Mountain about
half-way between Cass and Marlinton in Pocahontis County, West
Virginia. The caves are about 2 miles along the dirt road from
Cloverlick around Cloverlick Mountain, and about lz miles up the
hill. A stream flows into a large cave (Canis Major) in a rock
overhang. This cave in now being mapped by cavers at the National
Radio Astronomy Observatory at Green Bank. 400 feet Southeast of
the entrance to Canis Major is the entrance to Piddling Pit.
There are some very quiet cavers in D.C. who have explored this cave
fully, but since they would not respond, I assume they are dead for
all practical purposes.
The accompanying map was made with tape and (not a Brunton)
compass by Niel Albaugh of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory
in Green Bank, I have added and revised it to the present form
after many trips, some surveying (with Brunton), some just pacing
off with a compass. The unconnected passage (follow arrows) exists
but has not been mapped.
The entrance is a 25 foot drop. 35 feet away is another 25 foot
drop to 200 feet of side passage ending in a high dome pit. At
the top of the second drop is 100 feet of tight, dry, crawl. The
cave. then opens up and trends South-southeast for about 900 feet
to an intersection. The east branch goes over 300 feet to much very
small breakdown and a fissure drop of 25 feet. The south branch
goes over 1500 feet (as the bat flies) to the formation rooms. :.
The formations are numerous, untouched, and beautiful. Beyond the
formation rooms were found some deep pools. We dropped 15 pound. .
rocks from 35 feet up. 6 seconds after hitting the surface, each
rock would give a retort, thus it had finally hit bottom..
A passage heads back north toward the entrance from the formation
rooms for 700 feet where the passage assumes many different characteristics.
Well over 1000 feet from that area is a small room which is at the
bottom of the 25 foot fissure drop into the east branch.
