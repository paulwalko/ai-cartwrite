difficult to detonate without a blasting cap. But explosives can be
unpredictable, so handle with care anyway. Don't use the old dyna-
mite that your grandpa had left over from blasting out stumps sev-
eral years ago. The nitroglycerine in older Â· dynamite tends to set-
tle and form sensitive spots. The old cartridges will sometimes have
the glycerine leaking out of the wrapper. If you ever have occasion
to handle leaking: cartridges use gloves. Nitroglycerine is absorbed
directly into the blood stream through your hands. It can give you a
headache that you won't soon forget. It is also a good idea to wear
gloves when inserting a blasting cap into a dynamite cartridge. A
nitro headache is extremely painful.
Keep carbide lights away from dynamite (and any explosives).
The dynamite probably won't detonate but it may burn rather violently;
the blasting caps will detonate. This brings up another important
point: keep the caps separate from the dynamite until you are ready
to prime the charge.
Primers
Blasting caps are manufactured in many different types and sizes.
Electric detonators are useful in caves, but since I'm prejudiced toward
the cap and fuse method it will be explained here.
A number six blasting cap (or equivalent) is the most common type
of dynamite primer. A larger number eight cap will do the same job,
but it isn't really necessary for most dynamites. Blasting caps are
much more sensitive to shock and sparks than dynamite. Note: (again)
keep carbide lamp flames away from caps. The best method for carrying
caps into a cave is to insert them in styrofoam and place them inside
a small sturdy box. Don't carry them inside the dynamite box. Also,
blasting caps must be kept dry.
Fuse
One of the most common types of fuse sold in the East is Clover
Brand (orange) wax-coated safety fuse. It is water resistant, very
flexible and burns at about 120 seconds per yard; however, there are
many things that can affect the burning time, so if in doubt, test a
piece.
Crimping
The easiest and safest way to connect the cap and fuse is by
making a watertight crimp using hand-type cap crimpers. Cap crimpers
also have a convenient fuse cutter and dynamite punch. They are made
from a non-sparking metal and are well worth the investment. To in-
sure a good waterproof connection between the cap and fuse, it is best
to make a square cut across the fuse and make two crimps about 1/8
inch apart.
