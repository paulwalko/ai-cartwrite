The preceeding discussion probably sounds rather sacrilegious to
many respectable, conservation-minded cavers. This is one of those
rare instances where caving philosophy and conservation ethics are in
direct opposition, but I think the end justifies the means. The
reader will please note. at this point that I have carefully refrained
from including any suggestions about gypsum smashing and helictite
blasting. In this case, decisions will be dictated by conscience.
It should be obvious by now that common sense and a little ele-
mentary knowledge of rock mechanics are essential in almost any type
of cave blasting. It would be ridiculous to even attempt to describe
and evaluate all of the possible situations and problems that can occur;
however, a simple analysis of a few important mechanical characteristics
of rock is very helpful for determining where the charge should be
placed." The efficiency of a blast is dependent upon the type of explo-
sive, the condition and type of rock, the geometrical distribution of
the charges on the surface of the rock, and the coupling between the ex-
plosive and rock.
The internal stress developed in the rock as a result of the ex-
plosive force determines the fracture and extent of fragmentation which
occurs. Ã… given quantity of explosive will transmit more energy and
thus develop a higher internal stress if the charge is in close contact
with the rock. The following graph should illustrate how an air gap
between the explosive and rock affects the peak stress. For a one-inch
air gap the peak stress is only about one third as great as for a di-
rect contact charge.

his mentioned before, confinement of the charge is very desirable.
The following graph can be used to show that even a small amount of
confinement greatly increases the peak stress.
