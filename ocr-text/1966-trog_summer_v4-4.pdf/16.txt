about nine cartridges would be needed to blast three cubic feet of lime-

· In conclusion, several points should be emphasized.cathe ind's...
important of these is safety. Don't attempt any type of blasting until
you are thoroughly familias bith the rules of the game': : Itrgoes with-
out saying that explosives are a powerful tool if used correctly. But
if abused or used improperly, they are deadly. It is impossible for an
article such as this to discuss all the safety rules, handling pro-
cedures, and situations which can occur. Only the most basic principles
and those' pertaining especially to cave blasting have been presented
here:
Some final words: explosives have a nasty habit of making in-
credibly loud noises. In a cave the pressure waves are sometimes am-
plified and carbide lights are often extinguished, even hundreds of
feet from the blast. Don't stay near the blast and don't be too
anxious to crawl back into the hole to examine the resultsy Dynamite
fumes are deadly; two cavers recently lost their lives bedause of this.
Don't attempt any type of "solo" blastingy At least two people
must be present while lighting the fuse. When the fuse ignites it often
puts out the carbide lamp flame used to light ito Dynamite is rela-
tively inexpensive; the cost is only about 204 per cartridge. But don't
forget to check the local regulations goveming the transportation and
use of explosives.
Be careful and good cave making.
