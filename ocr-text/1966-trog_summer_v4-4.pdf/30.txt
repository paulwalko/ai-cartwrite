FANTASTIC KLEIN BOTTLE CAVE
Tazewell County, Virginia, has some pretty incredible caves. For
example, there is Steelers Cave, a combination solutional and fault
cave. There are Higginbotham's Caves, a pair of vertical caverns
that can text anyone's limits of endurance. There are the caves at
Glenwood Church that have very few close rivals for sheer beauty.
There are other oddities such as Fallen Rock, Ward Cove, and Maiden
Spring, some of which have yet to be fully explored. And one I know
of in particular will have to stay unexplored. It is known locally
as Klein Bottle Cave. It is owned by a Mr. Klein, and, as one might
expect, the entrance is littered with old bottles. . On a recent trip
to Tazewell County, my brother, Barry, and I undertook to explore
and, if possible, map this cave. Before the ordeal had run its course,
however, I decided that Mobeus Cave in Indiana wasn't so amazing after
all.
The entrance to Klein Bottle Cave is in the side of a low hill, and
takes the form of a small, conical sink. it first, there appeared to.
be no passable opening, but after a few minutes of prodding around, we
managed to force our way through some stubborn brush into the dank en-
trance room. The thick growth of weeds sprang back and all but hid the
entrance from view. This caused the entrance room to become immedi-;
ately darker than that to which our eyes could rapidly adjust. Not
wishing to waste any time, however, we waded through the pile of
bottles and began groping our way deeper into the cave; I on the left
wall, and Barry on the right (no pun intended). Our eyes gradually
became accustomed to the dark, and we found ourselves in a rather
tubular passage curving to the left. I was attempting to make a
rough survey of the cave by Brunton and pacing. According to my notes,
the passage seemed to be making a loop and heading toward the en-
trance; but just as I was expecting to make a closure, the walls di-
verged to form a room of colossal dimensions. We continued along our
respective walls, and Barry was out of sight in no time. Neither my
carbide lamp, my VPI spotlight, nor my candle would display the oppo-
site wall or the ceiling. I continued my survey for future reference.
After several minutes of pacing, I noticed that my wall was continuing
to diverge. "Hol√Ω infinity, Barry," I exclaimed, this is a big
room !!!
"It sure is!! His muffled an'swer seemed to come simultaneously
from beyond the wall and somewhere back in the room.
My lamp was rapidly growing dim, but I continued groping along the
wall, hoping to discover some sort of terminus. Just as my lamp was
about to fail, I noticed a faint glimmer of daylight and soon found
myself sitting in a pile of old bottles. Barry was standing by the
opposite wall, looking bewildered. We forced our way back through
the weeds into the blinding Jaylight
