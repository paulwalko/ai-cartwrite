TRIP REPORTS
Having crossed the pit again, we began to map the upper passage.
After some hairy chimneying, we managed to get up to the crawling
passage. This passage ended in a small room with a slit in the
ceiling. Since Barry was thinnest, he offered to slide through the
slit if we would give him help. We did.
After mapping the upper section, we chimneyed down 30 feet to.
the lower passage which was a dry streambed. In one of the dome
pits a colony of fossil Bryzoans was found. We finished mapping the
cave at about 3:30 and came out.
es we were leaving the Ward Cove area, we checked out the Thomp-
son Canyon Caves and came up with some promising leads. Also in a
small pit near Thompsons Canyon a previously unreported cave was found.
It could possibly be 200 feet or more in length. After checking this
area over, we headed back to VPI.

Personnel: George Stonikinis, Rick Keener.
Lat 8:00 a.m. George cut classes and picked up Rick and myself, so
that we might enjoy, once again, the adventures of "underground cave
exploring". We finally arrived at the cave site and prepared to enter
the cave at 3:00 pm. There were, of course, nasty remarks made about
my knee pads. (i.e., Meowoo00, Pansy, etc.)
The entrance is located on the side of a shallow sinkhole next to
Rt. 625. We entered the cave and immediately perceived that the Caves
of Virginia book was right; it was, in fact, a maze cave. Efter
spending much time exploring an unmapped section of the cave, we moved
to the canyon section and started the long chimney above the stream.
At 7:00 p.m. we turned back towards the entrance and started out.
Hout?!
"It's this way I think."
"'No, I think it's way!"
.
"Here's a formation, remember passing it?!!
''No!" and etc. to the entrance.
We spent six hours in the cave.- and got home 2:00 a.m.
Note: My knees were fine!
