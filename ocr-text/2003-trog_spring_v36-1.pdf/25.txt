Pack the van? Or drink and play darts? Not hard to guess which side of this dilemma won. There
will be plenty of time tomorrow to pack and recover from our hangovers.

T-5 hours till ‘imaginary’ departure. Well, today started with John's clutch blowing out and the
trip being delayed slightly. All I can say is it's a damn good thing. The car never would have been
ready for the trip if we really had to leave in 5 hours. I think it's all a big scam and everyone just told
me we were leaving today so I'd be ready when we really leave tomorrow.

. We're finally off. Departing Wal-Mart with a minivan equipped with all the latest in barracho
technology. Johnny Cash is playing on the stereo, the gps's are tracking, and the hula girl is doing her
little dashboard dance. Life is good.

Ekey status- as good as it gets
I find myself in almost the same spot I was last year. Sitting in the car with 2 smelly people I
call friends, but alas, this year there is another. With this journey to the land of caves and cheep beer
the Alison has earned her spot as a true buracho. Yet I have not decided if her presence will be a help
or a hindrance. But this late start did afford me an extra night of drinking in the burg and a really nice
headache to start my trip with. Given that the truth of the matter is that I really don't have anyone but
myself to blame for my hangover, and that I don't want to accept the truth, I will blame her. Since we
inducted a new buracho, we had to have more room in the car. To accomplish this task we stole
Ekey's sister's minivan. And since we had to out-do our trip from last year we had to equip it with
more toys. This years Mexico wagon sport 2 craptops (laptops), 2 dash mounted GPS units, 2 AC
power inverters, 2 digital cameras, a mini-fridge, a dash mounted hula girl and of course, a stuffed
squirrel. As the hash marks on the road pass by and I reflect of last year's trip I can see that many
things have not changed. Road trips with friends are the greatest thing ever, playing solitaire on the
way to Mexico is still fun, and even a “clean Ekey” still smells bad.
