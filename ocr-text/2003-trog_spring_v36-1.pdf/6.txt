Cole and Ray Sira operated the radio location transmitter and surveyed from the Mud Bridge radio
location point, to a radio location point located about halfway between the mud bridge and the back
entrance, and then finally to the back entrance. An above ground survey from the lower entrance to
the two ground zero locations was done by Scott Rapier, Steve Wells, and Sandy Knapp. You can
think of the radio location measurement as a plumb line depth measurement, but just through rock
instead of open air. With this in mind, you can see from Figure 2 that there are two independent
closed loops created by the survey.
