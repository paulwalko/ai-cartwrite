The best way to decide what options work for you is to practice above ground with several
racks before making a purchase. Find a friend who is willing to let you try theirs out. Not only will you
get a chance to try out different rack set-ups but you will gain experience on rope. Decide what options
work best for you and purchase your own rack from a caving retailer. If you don't have any friends or
you are on a limited budget, a rack with six standard bars makes a great beginner rack. It is much
cheaper than a rack with an expensive top bar and gives you a chance to really determine what you need
for caving.
Inner Tube Battery Case
By Mark Eisenbies
Tired of loose batteries in your pack? Having trouble keeping up with which batteries are fresher or
more recently purchased? This easy-to-build battery case helps keep your batteries dry and organized.
Simply take a 6-inch section of a mountain bike tube and two 3-inch sections with 1 inch of their ends
cemented shut. Pack new batteries in one end, and remove them from the other end (Figure 1). Slip
the 3 inch covers over the end and you have an assembly that takes up no more room that the
batteries themselves, and is water resistant (Figure 2).
