Philip fed the survey data into a survey program called Survex (http://www.survex.com), and it
calculated vertical distance for each set of the radio location points. We now had two ways of
determining the distance from points on the surface to the points in the cave.
The calculated survey distance at the Mud Bridge was 183 ft and the radio location depth by absolute
signal strength was 179.6 ft. Because the depth calculated from the radio location and the depth
calculated from the survey contain some errors, we do not know which one is correct. Since they are
close, we are reasonably confident that if we drilled a hole 179.6 ft, we would be quite close to the
station. The second station was similar, 113 ft found from the survey data and 108.75 ft. from the
radio location data.
With this, we have verified the radio location equipment and equipment operator are working
according to design. There are several situations where this data would be useful. With the radio
location equipment it is possible to drill into the cave. This is important for; cave rescue missions,
tapping into water sources, and creating new entrances. Since it is possible to accurately locate points
on the surface using GPS and other survey instruments designed for accurate surface survey work
(but entirely useless underground) radio location can also be used to improve the accuracy of in cave
survey done with handheld compasses. Finally, Brian Pease has an excellent website at http://
radiolocation.tripod.com that has far more detailed information about the theory and practice of cave
radio location. Furthermore, the website has information about how to build your own radio location
equipment.
Cavers Help Build Barn for Thompsons
By Michael Cole
Saturday April 12, 2003, eleven cavers from the club headed down to Bland County to help Jerry and
Molly Thompson set supports for a new barn. The Thompsons farm field where the club holds its
annual picnic, and every year we try to thank the owners by offering our help with work around their
farm. A few years ago, the club tore down the old collapsed shed that was directly in front of the
Thompson's home. The lumber from the shed was quickly transformed into firewood for Picnic.
This year, VPI cavers Kara Smith, Cameron Keyes, Mark Eisenbies, Steve Wells, Ray Sira, Mike
Cole, Philip Balister, Scott Rapier, Sandy Knapp, Joe and Carol Zokaites arrived at the Thompson's
house at ten o'clock ready to work..
No time was wasted; everyone immediately turned around and drove down the road to the site where
Jerry had laid out where he wanted his new barn. The new barn is located directly across from Buddy
Penley's old brick house. The first step of the project involved digging holes for the supports, which
were old telephone poles. This didn't take long thanks to Jerry's auger drill attachment for one of his
tractors. The auger wasn't able to dig all the holes because of large rocks in the way. Holes with rocks
were hand dug. Kara and Cameron became the experts at getting the large rocks out of the holes,
which made way for others to come dig the holes the rest of the way with post hole diggers. Once all
the holes were ready, we began placing the poles into the holes.
