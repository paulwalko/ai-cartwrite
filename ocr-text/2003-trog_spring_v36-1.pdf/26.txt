State numero tres: Ala-stupid-bama. The best thing about this state is the time zone change so I
get another hour of sleep. We've rotated drivers once now and had dinner. All the gear in the car has
already exploded and taken up all the spare space. There is no beer at all in the car. At least Hula Girl
looks happy. Time for me to snooze so I can get up tomorrow morning and take another shift.

Still cruising through Alamissippiana, the giant dark state between Tennessee and Texas. Seems
like the drivers are getting more worse, though Enrique is holding steady for now. Meanwhile,
bastard Ekey sits in the back oblivious. I hate Ekey. Wait, now bastard Ekey is talking. I wish he'd
go back to sleep. Bastard. Bastardress Alison also sleeps. Semi-bastard (not entirely unsure of his
paternity) Enrique smokes cigarette while following erratic deighanette. We've also reached the
sectiono bumpity-bump interstate, which is hard on the passengers, but hula girl seems to be enjoying
it. We are incidentally taking a new and semi-planned detour on this trip through New Orleans. We
may be stopping for gas as we pass through, and its my understanding that we'll have to pay with
beads. (Note that the “we” would have been the “me”, but fortunately they accepted Deighan's credit
card instead...okay so they insisted on it...-Alison)

I hate Te-has. At least it's 75 Deg F outside and the AC works. Stupid flat state. It's a good thing
they outlawed snow, because the kids would have no place to sled. With the mini-van repaired and 1/2
the barrachos asleep we are in a power saving mode in preparation for Bar-B-Q and a border cross. I
can see to the horizon in every direction. Forecast: 100% chance of flat. Would you like flat with that?
Paper or flat? Someone should buy me an airplane.

Finally here and on the road to Victoria. The first beer is now opened along with a resounding
chorus of OYTFAB. A relatively slight delay at the border is now only a memory as we are out of
Matamoros and speeding along a fine Mexican road. Where else can you drive along with a beer and
an open sliding door in the minivan while traveling along the highway? Spirits are high, the tres
barrachos have been waiting to be back all year and the quatro barracho has fallen in love with this
place already. Can't wait to see the place in the daylight.
Ekey says Tommy the Canexican and damn I love Mexico.
