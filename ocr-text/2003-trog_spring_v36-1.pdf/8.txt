Taking a break from the barn, other work was
done around the Thompson farm. Molly and
Carol, along with Steve and Mark, headed off for
part of the day to tear down two old fences and
carry remnants to the picnic site to use as
firewood.
At lunch time, the whole crew headed back to the
Thompson's house for chili hot dogs, chips, and
cake. Molly provided the lunch for all the hard
workers. As we were eating, Molly told us about
the cow used to make the chili. She said the chili
contained nearly no fat, because the cow they
used was very lean. Carol then asked how they
select which cow to eat, curious as to whether or
not they raise a special cow or just take the one
that looks the best. Molly said they picked this
cow because she hadn't had a calf in almost two
years. Ray then quickly remarked that Carol
hadn't had any children in two years either.
Wells and Spot supervise hole digging
After lunch work continued on the barn as the rest of the poles were placed. Good old brut force was
used to place the poles. Some poles proved to be more of a challenge than others. Two poles were
hickory trees Jerry had just cut down because we ran out
of phone poles. These two trees were the hardest, and
nearly crushed the crew on the first attempt because they
were so heavy. There were a total of twelve poles placed,
ranging in height from fifteen to twenty feet. The poles
were then set using rocks and dirt to fill in the holes to
hold the poles in place. Jerry told us that rocks and dirt
packed around the pole works much better than concrete.
That, and Jerry had plenty of extra rocks lying around his
fields to use. After all poles were set, the tops were cut off
to proper height with a chainsaw. Trimming the poles was
done by Scott and one of Jerry's neighbors, who would
stand in Jerryâ€™s tractor bucket and then be lifted up to the
top of the pole.
By four o'clock in the afternoon work for the day was
pretty much complete. All that remains to be completed on
the barn is to put up rafters, the roof, and siding. Jerry was
so impressed by our work he would like more help to
finish the project. He plans to work on it some more the
Friday, and perhaps, Saturday of picnic this year.
