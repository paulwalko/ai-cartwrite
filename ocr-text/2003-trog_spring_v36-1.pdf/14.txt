frigid when the formations were formed, as the CO, was not able to escape before the freezing. Clear
formations meant there was time for the CO, to escape and therefore, not as cold.
As captivated as I was by all of this, Bogdan and I were soon ready to move onto the next
portion of our trip and check on the lower section of the cave. At first I was not sure where the pit
was located, but Bogdan quickly led the group near the entrance of the cave and pointed past the
guardrail. There on the other side of the frozen lake was a mouth of pure darkness and uncertainty.
What was once a cascading river was now a blanket of ice, disappearing into an abyss. We climbed
over the guardrail and began looking for places to rig. And at this point, I was proud to be VPI. For I
almost laughed out loud, when the rig point was identified as two rusted pitons jutting up through the
icy floor (one with an eyelet, the other without-clearly having rusted away several years ago.) Here
the spirit of the classic VPI asshole descended upon me as I began searching for an alternative rig
point. It was Bogdan intention to tie a double eight and biner one of the loops into the complete piton
and drape the other loop over the rusted stem. I could smell disaster all over that one and I could just
hear the club's safety chair raising hell, so I calmly suggested we use the BFR behind us as the main
rig point. I quickly tied a mountaineering bowline around the BFR and readied myself for the
descent....
I leaned back feeling the slack being consumed by my rappel device and stepped as steadily
backward as I could manage. This was the moment that I had been waiting for since Bogdan had first
mentioned this cave two months prior. Once the icy lip was negotiated the rest of the rappel was easy.
Fascinating as it was, I could see the various layers in the ice as I rappelled downward, each layer of
ice representing an eon lost in time and differing water levels thousands of years before. Though the
rappel was only 50 feet to the bottom, the lower section of the cave promised many other sights to
behold. At the bottom was a 1,100 year old tree frozen in what was (at one time) an impressive
waterfall. And by the light of my dying ceiling burner, I could make out more formations that waited
in the distance. Due to their location on an icy slope and the lack of a hand-line, we decided against
going to investigate. After all, I had already fallen three times and learned that without crampons,
walking on ice is virtually impossible. I almost hated to leave, but as the rest of the team was freezing
at the top of the pit, we headed out. Frogging on ice is an experience in itself if you have never
attempted it as your knees wind up pressing against the unforgiving ice. So 10 minutes later and 600
seconds colder, we arrived topside. The rest of the group had already headed out, preferring the cold
evening air to that of frigid temperatures in the cave. And as much as I hated to admit it, I was
fatigued and ready to embark upon the long hike back to Garda. All the way home I thought about
how fortunate I was to have experienced such a phenomenal cave and if I would ever again get a
chance to visit Gharda. That night we all supped together, each becoming activated from the
abundance of Tuica and strong Romanian wine, but we shared in the comradery and relived the
adventures of the day. Unfortunately our group would break up the next day, as Anita and I were off
to Brasov, but with us we would take with us the acquired knowledge of how far the caving
community actually extends. Though different as we were, we still had much in common. Technique
and protocol may have separated us, but our passion and love for caving made us part of a larger
family and a greater whole.
