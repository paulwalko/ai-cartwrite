rocket with a short stick and fuse. No wait, Ekey is one of those rockets you put water in and pump
up. Everyone is just jealous of Ekey. No, that seemed to inspire laughter. Finally. Silence.

The last 20 miles from home seem so slow. Each mile seems longer than the last. We are heading
to the Ton for darts and the end of the trip. It is time to reflect on the things I learned this year:
1) In Mexico when you use the bathroom your friends ask, “how did it go?” when you are done.
If it wen well you are proud, if not you hsng your head in shame. In the US this is just not normal.
2)In Mexico, if you are not drinking a beer in the car, you must be sick. In the US if you drink a
beer you must have a sick jail wish.
3) TO live dangerous in Mexico you eat your veggies, in the US you cant live dangouously while
having dinner.
4)In Mexico I am a rich rich man. In the US I am a poor college student.

Exit 118B, and it looks like the minnie vinnie may make it after all. We're settling on “Huichyan
again? (almost 110% return rate)” for the signout quote. I'm tired, foul smelling, sore and ready to
get a few beers at the ton. Just enough time now to play ring of fire one last time and sign this entry.
