right knee. Backing off the jack returned the rock to its original position relieving the added pressure
on my knee but my arm was still badly pinned. We realized that to free my arm we would have to
chock the slab somewhere down by my ankles but to access them Dave would have to pass over me
and the slab on top of me. Four feet directly above the slab was another 200-pound slab hanging
vertically and held in place at its upper end by the breakdown that made up the ceiling, not an easy
choice but at this point seemingly the only option. Summoning up a good deal of courage as well as
the aid of the appropriate spirits Dave made his move and made it across the slab without further
deterioration of the situation. My arm now was completely numb and yet extremely painful. It seemed
to be dying and I deeply mourned its apparent passing.
Having made it across the slab, Dave became energized with optimism. I think this was a turning
point for both of us. Even though I was not yet free the pro3blem and its dangers seemed suddenly
more defined and the solution seemed within our grasp. Dave placed the jack under the slab and
raised it slightly. Attempts to chock up the slab did not work
however: the available rocks and the geometry of the space he attempted to fill with them were
incompatible; the rocks slid out from under the slab as he lowered the weight of the slab onto them.
We realized we would need a second jack, one for raising the slab by my feet and holding it up and the
second to slide it off my arm. A second jack quickly arrived. By this time the call for more cavers to
help had been answered, and Mike Corbet took up the position above my head where Dave had
previously been.
I positioned the second jack with my left hand as in the previous attempt to free my arm. Mike
cranked the handle until the jack made solid contact with the passage wall and the slab. Dave then
started cranking up the slab at my ankles and within a minute or two I was able to move my right knee
from the space it was trapped in. Mike then carefully began to crank more on his end and within
another minute I was able to drag my arm from the constriction.
I had been pinned for an hour and a half but it felt more like a week as I pushed myself up from the
semi prone position I had been in. At the point when I was again standing the chilled blood trapped in
my arm and now circulating through me lowered my body temperature to the point that I began to
shiver uncontrollably and I could barely catch my breath: instant hypothermia. The shivering subsided
after about a minute and I crawled another 10 feet and rested as Daryl Trusty, caver/paramedic,
checked me out. I got the "good to go" and mostly under my own power crawled the last 40 feet to
the entrance where a helpful boost popped me out. I had made it out but the struggle was far from
over. Almost four months later nerve function has returned to my right hand to allow simple grasping
motions and slow typing (definitely faster than one-hand typing). To get to this point I have
undergone painful nerve studies, acupuncture, osteopathic manipulation, STEMS treatments and
masses of physical therapy. I list these things only to give an idea of the repercussions of this incident.
Although a serious situation, it could have been a lot worse. I consider myself lucky not to have been
hurt any more than I was. Initial projections by my doctors for recovery agreed on about six months.
Given the rate of recovery thus far I would say they were right on target and I am very grateful. As a
result of this incident I have had a fair amount of time to consider many of the aspects of it and have
come to some conclusions I hope might be useful to others.
