Can I Call Myself a Caver?
By Samantha Lambert
Throughout my four years as part of the cave club, I can not recall how many times I have
been asked, “Why Caving?” I guess you can call it the 64,000 dollar question. I mostly hear it from
my family and friends back home. They always get the same response from me, “Just because I like
it”.
I have never once truly explained why I picked caving, to them. Maybe it is because I, myself,
have never sat down to figure why caving is my bag. In the beginning, a part of me was afraid. I knew
I would come up with the wrong answer. I was only playing around in the wet cold caves just to
spend time with the guy I was dating. That is not a good enough reason to call myself a caver.
I still struggle with this question every time I go caving. What have I done to be called a
caver? There are a lot of things to justify me being a caver, but some, I just don't agree with. For an
example, I have my own cave gear. What does that mean? I know of a few people who went caving
twice, bought all the gear, and then never went caving again. I would not call them cavers. Oh, I got
it! I have been in 12-15 different caves. But over half of the time, I was crying or swearing, instead of
caving. One of the most famous phrases you could catch coming out of my mouth is, “I will never go
caving again!” That is definitely not caver-like. Some would say I was chairmen of the club's Publicity
Committee for two years, so that might make me a caver. My response is, I am an advertising major
and used it as learning experience. Maybe I am caver because all of my friends are cavers. No, that
would make me a groupie. It could be the bat sticker on my car. If that is the case, then the person
who bought my old car is a caver too.
I have thought long and hard about this question. The only thing I can come up with is this:
every time I go caving I look at the trip as a journey. It is a journey to a place that is not
commercialized, that is not a tourist trap. Caving is my journey to a place where I don't have to pay a
fee at the gate. I am one with nature. While caving, I am as close to nature as one can get. It is not
only the purity of the caves that draw me near, but now there is more. (and no, it is not just to spend
time with the guy I am dating. He does not cave very much anyway). My love of nature and caving
bring out my love for challenges. I had never thought I loved a challenge, but I must because I can't
get enough of Links. Every time I take my journey underground, I am faced with challenges, physical
and/or mental ones. And yes, most of the time I find myself crying through them, but as soon as I step
out of the cave into the bright light of the sun or moon, I get a feeling of achievement. I accomplished
my goal for the day. I walked into a cave and I walked out of a cave safely.
So maybe in the end, that is how I can call myself a caver. To me, being a caver is not what
you buy, or who you hang out with. It is how you feel when you are underground. This is what draws
you back down every time.
