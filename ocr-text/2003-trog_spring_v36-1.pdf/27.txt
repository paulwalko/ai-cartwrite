Wow, a New Year in Mexico, and the rest of the world too I assume. I've been doing most of the
Mexico driving because I love the lack of traffic laws/rules/regulations. The two and a half lane roads
almost allow for a passing lane. You sort of request space from oncoming traffic with your high beams
and then pray. Whoops, time to go, write more later... OK Back in style. The car is turned around and
we are ready to go, waiting on the other cars. I would explain why we are waiting, but it will probably
get me in trouble. So here's the deal: I'll write it down here, but if it is missing in the final edit, you'll
know it was too bad to print. Aaron found a local girl last night in the middle of the new year's bash.
He went home with her, and now doesn't want to leave her. Now he is negotiating so that she can
come spend the night with us at ‘drinas. OK we're leaving. I can't type as much as I want because I'm
driving. Oh well. Was the middle of my entry deleted? Probably. (editor's note: yes indeed it was]

In the time since I last found the motovation to type, quite a bit has happened that is worth
making fun of people for. Our drop into Golindrinas was 100% successful. All cavers made it to the
bottom of the pit, and during my short stay I decided bird pictures would be really nice to have. As if
to tell me how they felt about this idea, as soon as I rasied my camera a bird took a huge SHIT on my
face. While I saw this as the low point of my trip, Chris saw it as the high point and took my picture.
After a nice dinner in the pit and Chris and I's climb out of 56 min most people past right out. In the
morning I took down the rig Ekey had made. By far the biggest pit I have ever rigged without some-
one I percive as knowing lots more than I do around to tell my if I was fucking up. But we all seem to
be alive. Now we are off to the Bird House, and best of all a shower.

Well that's the caving part of the trip. The drive up to ‘drinas was thrilling, with a number of
prayers said to the god of Chryslers when the transmission started transmitting intermitted. Met a
fascinating guy from Mexico City who teaches english. His english was good and his knowledge of
American literature and cinema put me to shame. Cepilla remains a fantastic cave, with a rappel just
big enough to really enjoy the trip down, but not as big as to make the climb out any more than a
minor pain in the ass. Golondrinas was a good time. While I rappelled, 3 Texas cavers were frogging
out (at the same time). As I passed by, not going too fast, I noticed that they were rocketing up rope
at amazing speed. Fun with perspective, and good to get a better idea how fast the bottom is coming
up at me. Played around in the bottom for a bit waiting for 2 pairs of climbers to go up. Lots of
picture taking. Barrachos had a nice in pit dinner of MRE's. For the first time on this trip I had a
chance to read the book I bought, though only for about 5 minutes. Then it was time to gear up and
get out of the pit. Eric did a good job of keeping me climbing and therefore unhappy. Climb out in
the dark is pretty odd, nice, but in a nauseating way. Didn't vomit on the rope though. Finally
reached the top, enjoyed half a beer then let the bottle slip from my hands, committing a grande
Mexico foul.

After aquismon we headed off to xilitla, reputed to be a paradise of beds and showers. It did not
disappoint, and by dinner time we were looking and smelling better. We had dinner in the snootiest
restaurante in town. Alison and I split a pizza with sausage, bacon, and fire on it. My bowels laughed
