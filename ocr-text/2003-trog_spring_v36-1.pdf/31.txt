LOST... Travis is gone again. I think we realized about 30 miles down the road. He even thought
we were going to come back to find him. The minivini is racing for home...there is no turning back
now....

Ha Ha! I am finally back in the US after hauling around 4 smelly, dirty gringos for days on end in
the minivan-unfriendly country of Mexico. They even gave me a black eye by running over a stupid
retread on the road and breaking my pretty turn signal and fog light. That is definitely going to leave a
mark. Even my friendly blue rescue squad plate decided to jump ship and become Mexican roadside
trash than travel with these stupid people. Wanna know the secret for getting silly gringos to take you
home? I turned on my "check engine‚Äù light and it totally freaked them out. They finally stopped and
gave me some more oil. I guess that made me happy for a while, but they still hadn't gotten me out of
this tope-ridden country. Turned it on one more time and they finally took the hint and took me back
to my native soil. I am in Texas, but am now at least hopeful for a return to Blacksburg and my owner
who treats me like the dainty vehicle I am.

I continue to drive, but now I have found typist. Alison will type whatever I say, even if I go on
and on and on and on and on and on. I can't believe she typed that. I can't believe she typed that
either. Wow, Alison is so nice (stupidhead). I can't believe she typed that either. Do not type that part.
Ok, um, no stop typing. I hate Chris. Travis' car is fixed. Minivini is very happy. Only day and a half
til Blacksburg. Dinner soon all is well. Only thing better than flat Texas is, well, everything.

Back in VA! 110 miles left to go and the minivan is getting mad. Ekey thinks the check engine
light is getting redder. No sooner than getting back to VA did we manage to find a worse driver than
almost anyone other than Ekey in Mexico. After at least 5 unsuccessful attempts to pass our mean-
looking minivini on the right, this girl finally gave up and left the interstate. We are preparing for a
DBOS since the Deighanettes are excited to be close to the burg. Yet again we have lost Travis.
Actually we lost him within the first mile or two after leaving our last gas stop in TN, but we are just
now feeling guilty enough to make some feeble attempts to contact them on the radio and now figure
they will turn up in Blacksburg sometime. The minivan will revolt at any attempt to turn back south.
And it is equally likely that Travis and Amanda let Aaron drive while they slept and he turned the
rocket ship back towards Huichiyan. I am looking forward to getting out of the car in Blacksburg, but
am not looking forward to the cold temperature and the return to real life. I miss Mexico already.
Time for a the-trip-is-not-really-over-yet drinking fest at the Ton...just like drinking in Mexico only
more expensive, not outside, and quite a few more dirty gringo cavers. End of log for me...

How bout you just record some of our wittier statements. Hey stupid. No tu. No tu. Punch
equals punch. Asshat. My asshat is bigger than your asshat. I imagine that it is at least it is a couple of
sizes larger. At least mine smells better. Bet you washed it in your dainty mcdainty. Ekey is the sexual
