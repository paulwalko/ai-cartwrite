Carroll Bassett is the sole proprietor and developer of Bassett Metal Studios (BMS; URL is hiji

technical caving and cave rescue devices. Carroll is one of the foremost authorities in the U.S on
technical rescue riging. Although it was awful that he was involved in this accident, it was very
fortunate that he wasn't unjured further and even more fortunate that he has provided some really
valuable insights based on his experience.
Foreword
I began thinking about this report soon after the event described herein. Feeling that a brief history
leading up to the event was important to understand the circumstances, I have included an extremely
abbreviated version. The conclusions on the events are mostly my own. Discussion and responses are
encouraged and important to this community. My goal is to in some small way make digging safer.
A Short History
The original entrance to this cave was at the end of a blind karst valley fed by a small stream which
had been dug open in the late 60's only to be permanently flooded shut in 1971 by hurricane Agnes.
Before this unfortunate event however, over 10 miles of passage had been surveyed and mapped with
many more going leads left to explore.
With the sale of the property at auction in the late 90's the West Virginia Cave Conservancy (WVCC)
began a difficult and frustrating series of negotiations with the new owners, an investment group who
planned to develop the remaining property. After a verbal agreement was arrived at with the new
owners, a survey was completed on the approximately 5-acre piece comprising the bottom of the
karst valley, most of which had been designated as flood plain and is undevelopable under FEMA
regulations. Upon entering into an agreement with the Greenbrier Valley Economic Development
Corporation (GVEDC), a state-funded entity created to bring industry into the area, the new owners
abandoned on their agreement with WVCC.
A new round of negotiations with the GVEDC produced another verbal agreement but this time the
surveyed property was to be donated to the WVCC in return for public acknowledgment of their
generosity and environmental concern. The amount that the GVEDC agreed to pay to the new
owners, which was essentially state money, was more than three times what they had paid at the
original auction less than six months earlier.
The jubilation of the new owners at their windfall was to be short lived however. Apparently state law
dictates that any development with public money requires environmental impact studies before
transactions can be finalized. The results of the study indicated that development might directly
threaten at least two endangered species. It is suspected at this point that this gave the GVEDC a way
out of the deal which they might have wanted for political reasons. It however had the very negative
effect of severely alienating the owners from the caving community; they mistakenly arrived at the
