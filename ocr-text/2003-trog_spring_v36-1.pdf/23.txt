Adopt-a-Trainee
By John Booker
Blacksburg offered some interesting caving trips during spring break. During a trip to Clover
Hollow, Aaron inspired a great new idea for moving trainees through their requirements faster: steal
their stuff.
The impetus comes from Aaron turning around and leaving a trip early due to prior
engagements and driving off with Brian McCarter's and my own personal belongings, such as house
keys. Left homeless, we were subjected to a horrible night of only cavers for company! Luckily we
realized that we actually enjoyed it. A good time was had by all, and since we were homeless, we
stayed at Kirk's and did some vertical practice the next day. Sadly, Aaron's true mistake was not
when he pilfered our gear, but instead that he returned it too soon. Had he not, Brian and I would
have been members long before you read this article. Kidnapping trainees and putting them through a
rigorous boot camp is a surefire way to have them secure their membership in a matter of weeks,
minus the minimum week requirement. I humbly propose the implementation of a new program I call,
“Adopt-a-Trainee.'
Enrollment is simple. At least two members take a trainee on a trip, with one of them
arranging to leave early with the trainee's belongings. What if the trainee drives themselves? Well,
part of this program is to ensure that this does not happen. Some ways to avoid this scenario are to
carpool under the excuses that either the trainee doesn't know the location, or that the trainee's
vehicle cannot make it to the cave. Do not allow the trainee to drive lest you grant them an avenue of
escape! Once the trainee is secured, commence the transfer of caver knowledge immediately. Do not
allow them time to ask such questions as, “Is this legal?” “Where did my money go?” or “Did you eat
my medication?” They are only trying to distract you from completing your mission. And so it
begins...
Day One-Vertical Work
Climbing and rappelling basics should be covered in the first two hours. Next comes
advanced underground condition simulation. Tell the trainee the complications involved in rigging
near a waterfall, then show him with a garden hose (Which brings me to a side point, the club should
purchase a hose that can reach to the quarry). Next allow time for lunch. Again, don't let them
deceive you, one bowl of gruel is plenty enough. Then it's back for changeovers and rebelays.
Day Two-Indoctrination
Clockwork Orange Style. A video encompassing safety techniques, caving etiquette,
landowner relations, and all around caver values will be shown. To be absolutely sure the trainee is
paying attention, the methods that proved so effective in A Clockwork Orange will be employed.
Day Three-Caving
This is where the trainee will show if foregoing sleep for the previous two days was worth it.
Everything they learned in the past two days must be demonstrated. Rigging, rope climbing,
rappelling, change-overs, and elementary climbing will be a breeze. Actual caving experience is nice,
but it's no match for 48 continuous hours of demonstrations and lectures!
Day Four- Regurgitation
Knowledge is power, and today will be the day to see if the trainee is weak or strong. All the
various tests will start at dawn. There will be no breakfast before the carbide lamp is assembled.
