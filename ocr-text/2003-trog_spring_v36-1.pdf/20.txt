Starnes Radiolocation
By Matthew Burnett
If you go to the back of Starnes, you have come to Lost Promise. There is no mistaking that Lost
Promise comes extremely close to the surface. You can see surface debris all over the place, there is a
temperature change and you can actually smell the
surface air. Since Philip's cave radio proved
successful, he now wanted someone else to carry

that damned thing to the back of Starnes and see

exactly how close to the surface Lost Promise is.

The radio consisted of coil of wire contained in a
everyoning
wooden rectangular box that measured 16 x 19.5 x
2 (see diagram) that was the antenna, a battery and
Surdy corers to
a switching box. I sought reassurance that these

items could be beaten soundly and still work.

Philip said everything but the switching box could.
Well, we would see exactly how much abuse that

On Saturday, March 15, Kevin Rock, Kara Smith, Kathy Despain and I set off for Starnes. The plan
was that we would get underground at 10 AM, get to the Plinkerboing at 1 PM and Lost Promise an
hour later. The Plinkerboing shot was to be an orienting shot so the surface crew would know roughly
where we were and when to expect us at Lost Promise.
As expected we did not get underground until somewhere around 10:30 (and no, it was not because I
was watching Mystery Science Theater 3000). We decided to travel relatively light that day: each
person would be responsible for their own food, water and vertical gear but we would share lamp
equipment and extra gear, like webbing. Faced with the Humble Pie crawl, I decided to strip my gear
down further and ditch my usual steel rack in favor of an eight and my frog in favor of a more
compact knots system.
I had even cut a new piece of rope for the 30ft drop. My usual rig is a 50ft piece and, if you rig it just
right, you get the thrill of rappelling off the end of it and dropping to the floor. If you rig it wrong,
then you get the thrill of rappelling off the end of it and falling to the floor. No such adventure today.
We entered the Humble Pie with the usual high amount of regret for going to the back of Starnes.
Kathy and Kara had never been to through the Humble Pie so Kevin and I briefed them on what to
expect and how to carry their equipment. Because I have what is known in medical circles as weak
little girly arms, I generally attach my gear to a quick link in my shoelaces and drag it through the
crawl. With my pack and all of Philip's junk attached to my right foot I found I could barely move it.
Kathy wrapped her pack strap around her ankle while Kara and Kevin were manlier than I and
decided to largely push their packs.
I cannot offer much detail about the crawl as the view is fairly limited for most of it. I went first and
Kara volunteered to go behind me and free up my equipment when it would get stuck. The antenna
box was brilliantly designed with a large square cut out of the middle of it that catches on any little
