Stoopid Caving Tricks
By Mark Eisenbies
Cavers come up with all sorts of bright ideas, but never really share them with each other. Perhaps
they think it isn't worth tooting your own horn over something so simple. Perhaps they think it's too
obvious. After polling the membership, here are some standouts (actually it's everything... people just
don't want to share or something), covering everything from keeping warms to surveying hints.
Anyhow, don't keep those stupid ideas to yourselves. Share your innovations with the rest of us.
1) Surveying:
Colored LED's make good survey markers. Instruments know which is on
your head and which is on the station.
• Fleece Balaclavas protect instruments and keeps your skin warm.
2) Carbide lamps
• The spark from a Peizeo electric cigarette lighter is sufficient to light
a carbide lamp. Drain the fluid and cut a port so the acetylene from the lamp has access to the spark.
Works when wet. I carry it strung around my neck with my tip cleaner.
. A squeeze mustard bottle makes a good water bottle. Funnel allows you to
fill a carbide lamp while still on your head. If you have separate bottles for carbide and drinking water,
the spout lets you suck up water from pretty insignificant pools of water without stirring up sediment.
. An old car or house key makes a good scraping implement. Keep it on a
string with your tip cleaner. Use it to clean out your carbide lamp or scrape mud off of clothing.
3) Keeping Warm;
• Bring a butter knife to scrape mud off of clothes. They'll dry out
faster. Nice tip for people who don't have ‘modern'cave clothing.
Falling under the ‘no-cotton' concept of keeping warm, speedo bathing
suits are good cave underwear...assuming you wear underwear.

4) General Tools:
• A mallion rapide gate can double as an adjustable wrench for loosening
stuck gates on other mallions, and loosening bolts.
. Bring a spoon. Big end for spoon applications, small end for digging
carbide from base of lamp.
• Just bring a knife and a fork. Threaten to eat the slowest trainee.
• Webbing can be used as a strap wrench to loosen carbide lamp bases
or stuck carabineer gates
5) Electric Lights
• Clear packaging tape can be used to protect electric light lenses. When
it gets scratched up, just replace the tape. Tape is a lot cheaper than a new bezel and may even save
you a whole light purchase.
