at my feeble attempts to lull them back to sleep with pepto and by our “party on the roof' they were in
full rebellion. Still, as having the bad bano disease goes, this wasn't too bad. Personally, I felt fine,
like a normal healthy person who happens to occasionally spray burning shit out his ass. I managed to
timed things well enough that these little bano breaks didn't interrupt seeing the market on Sunday or
visiting Las Pozas. Las Pozas was more or less the same, ie still amazing. I decided this year I would
take a lot of tripod shots as some of my photographs from last year had ended up being pretty soft.
Lugging a tripod around wasn't thrilling, but hopefully I'll end up with some nice shots.

Okay, had to stop because minivan became super unhappy. After all of the promising not to take
her on bad roads, we convinced her to take us on a horribly bad road to the waterfalls at Tamul. So,
after a few miles or so into the trip, the barrachos were walking. At least the three barrachos with the
exception of Ekey, who was driving... Eventually, the barrachos decide that it is best to do as Mexi-
cans do and avoid walking the 10 miles to the waterfalls. So, Chris gets on the back tire of the
Deighan mobile, Eric rides the crap on top of Travis' vehicle like a horse (complete with webbing
reigns and lots of hat waving), and I climb onto the back bumper of Travis' vehicle and hold onto the
roof rack. An exciting way to ride 8 miles of bad Mexican roads, especially when holding onto the car
with one hand and trying to drink a beer with the other. After 4 beers I either got better at holding on
with one hand or I stopped caring if I got thrown off the bumper.

After a longer than planned stay in Xilitia due to the need for sleep, we set off to see Tamul's
waterfalls. After giving the minivan another beating we reached our river side camp site. We had a
nice camp Mexican meal, shot off some Mexican fireworks and sat around the fire. Right as I had
about all the beer there was to be had, and all the rest of the van was asleep, I started to make my way
too the tent. As soon as I arrived a light rain had picked up to become a hard shower. And as I opened
the tent door I heard the cry to “ABANDON SHIP”. As it turns out, our nice new Sears tent was not
very water proof AT ALL. So Ekey and I opted to sleep in the trusty minivan and Chris and Alison
decided to set up another tent drunk in the rain. As morning and the Mexicans who were to take us to
the falls came, we were of course way behind. But we did make it to the falls, and they did really kick
ass. And then they took us to a cave that was good for swminig and jumping off of the walls into. As
we left we once again pushed the minivan to its very limits trying to leave. Now we are heading
toward the coast and to see the pyrmids.

Tuxpan is icky...I am looking forward to heading back towards small towns. And apparently no
one really knows the name of this town either. Half of the signs, posters, and t-shirts say Tuxpan and
the other half say Tuxpam. Maybe that is how they distinguish the tourists from the locals. We
paddled 2 wooden boats upriver and stopped at a convenient rock in the middle of the river that had a
gorgeous view of the 300' cascades de Tamul. Maybe next year we will rappel from the top. Even
more fun was the stop on he paddle back which had a short walk up a hill to a cave entrance. The
cave was filled with water (supposedly 120' deep according to the guides) and made for a nice swim-
ming hole. We also found the highest point possible to jump off of into the water. Not being one for
jumping off high places and falling for long distances, I took a little convincing. I finally jumped, fell
