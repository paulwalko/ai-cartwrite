Grotto Grapevine
By A.I. Cartwright
Merry Couplings
After a relatively quiet fall, several new bonding
pairs have emerged. Joe Thompson & Kelly Rose
are getting married this May. Kristen Matak and
her boyfriend are talking marriage. And after a
brief courtship, Kenny married a girl he met after
calling the Victoria's Secret Customer Service
credit card helpline.
Weekly Programming
Chip Clark returned to VPI to do a program on
cave photography techniques. VPI did a very nice
job behaving itself, asking numerous questions.
Clip Clark seemed very pleased with VPI this
year. The horrendous antics of a few cavers at the
Banquet of Spring 2002 has not scarred his
memory of VPI. However, could these past antics
be one of the many reasons why we had a new
location for banquet this year? Banquet was held
at Custom Caterering Center, without much
disturbance. VPI Cavers braved a horrid icestorm
to attend. No accidents were reported.
Meanwhile
Aarron Thomas brings Felicia to Banquet, meets
Esperanzana in Mexico, brings Sarah to Dave C's
garage warming party and has since been seen
with Julie, Bonnie, Jessica, Laura and Mother
Theresa. Speaking of Dave C., he has a new
garage complete with rope-running capabilities.
However, he and Patricia didn't have a chance to
“christen” it because another couple got it on--I
mean, got on it, first.
More Calender Events
A big thanks to Chris Michie for taking
over Picnic Chairman from Eric Stanley. (Stanley
said he would not be attending this year due to
prior engagements). He will be missed. Or will
he? Another member was missed during a
weekend cave club event. One ex-presidente
who, “has no responsibilites anymore” did not
participate in Road Clean up, although I
remember his prescence at Easterbeer. Road
Clean up went off without a hitch and was
completed in less than two hours. Isn't it amazing
what can happen when cavers see the beer at the
end of the tunnel? Easterbeer was a great sucess-
-everyone was nice to each other and the super-
cliques did not dominate. Cheers to good times!
Moving On and Moving In
Have Amanda Stiles & Travis Coad have broken
up again? Wait, I thought was she moving in with
him. Is she? Is he? Are they? Samantha Lambert
is moving into the shack with Chris. Their bridge
seems stable enough. It won't collapse anytime
soon. AND Sam got her membership after four
years of hanging around. Just in time for her
graduation from Radford. Congratulations Sam!
In addition, Kevin Rock is graduating from VPI
this spring. However, it seems the townie
population is growing. He says he's staying
around next year. Lucky for Kara Smith.
Katherine Ferguson is back in town on maternity
leave. There are speculations of her willingness to
quit her 60K job and stay here. If she does,
everybody can look forward to having Craig
being less crabby. Nikky LaBranche and Brad
Atkinson are moving back into town and out of
the Doe Creek House. There are numerous
speculations on the real reason why.
Things-a-Changing
Douglas Peterson is alive and well and a
freshman at Virginia Tech. But we still haven't
seen hide nor hair of him. When will little Dougie
show up? Philip Balister has found a new way to
make himself useful around the club. He caves
without being underground. The development of
his cave radiolocation equipment has allowed for
other cavers to take grueling trips (see article by
Matt Burnet) while Philip remains aboveground.
Oh, he also has begun production of LEDs. Our
good friend Doug Cole is heading out to San
Diego, CA to participate in Project Walk, a
clinical program during which we hope he regains
more use of his legs. Good luck, Doug!
