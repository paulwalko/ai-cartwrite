Once we reached Garda (Gerda), the small village that would serve as our home base, we
immediately checked into a bed and breakfast and were quickly served with a heavy, Romanian dinner
consisting of several courses, hot peppers, and a very potent plumb brandy known as Tuica (Ts-oi-ca).
Tuica is roughly 120 proof and is taken before meals as a sign of friendship and comradery. The
official toast is, Narog, which was explained as meaning, “good health.” Then along with the meal, a
fine Romanian wine was served. Needless to say, once dinner was concluded, Anita and I were feeling
sufficiently activated and the rest of the group was feeling up to a late evening stroll to a local cave
known for its unique flowstone, dilapidated iron wrought stair case, and history as a living museum.
The hike to the cave itself was incredible. If you can imagine the traditional picture of Romania, laden
with mist, the Carpathian Mountains overgrown with thick ever-green forests, and the last rays of the
sun disappearing over the mountains, you will understand how accurate that stereotype actually is.
The cave itself was interesting, but not as spectacular as I had anticipated. As I recall, the flowstone
was unique, but nothing that cannot be seen in the wedding room of Links or in the entrance pit of
Pretty Wells in TAG. What was unique, however, was a small spring that jutted out close to the mouth
of the cave that served as the water supply to several houses in the village. Bogdan offered us a taste
from this spring and despite natural inclinations to preserve our health, we erred on the side of, "well,
you only live once.” Fortunately, sickness did not descend upon Anita and I and the water was so pure
it possessed a crystalline sweetness that was simply delicious. As good as the Tuica and wine were,
the water outclassed them by far.
The next morning, refreshed from a long and restorative sleep, we quickly ate and prepared
for the long hike up to the cave. Our destination, Ghetar, was a hamlet located on a plateau, and
proved to be quite a challenging hike-at least for us westerners. The local Romanians scrambled up
the steep, winding mountains paths as if they were nothing more than a simple obstacle to overcome.
And as we could not quite keep up with the locals, we finally arrived in Ghetar late in the afternoon
with eager anticipation for what lay before us. Before we could enter this ice cave, however, we had
to first don our caving gear and it was here that I learned a very valuable lesson: cavers from various
parts of the world have differing concepts as far as gear and safety are concerned. Having been trained
in the outstanding VPI tradition, I was a little taken aback by the shortage of helmets, the appearance
of non-locking biners in place of locking ones, knots, undressed and jammed in the life support
cordage, and the lack of tethering the top ascender to the harness in their frog systems. While this was
a little hard to reconcile, I finally lightened up some as I watched Bogdan provide a bit of late minute
entertainment by prepping our ceiling burners. Evidently in Romania, pebble grade carbide is hard to
come by, as bulk rock is more plentiful. Thus Bogdan spent a few minutes busting huge carbide rocks
into smaller pieces fit for our ceiling burners. With splinters of carbide flying through the air and
sizzling upon contact with the wet earth, it did not take me long to appreciate the ever-flowing supply
of carbide from the VPI storage bin.
Soon we were ready to descend into the cave. A long and multi-platformed staircase provided
the main access into the cave. It was covered in ice in places but provided an excellent view of the pit
on the way down. The walls of the pit were a strange mixture of deep green, peeking out from the
snow, and large trees having fallen in and perched on ice-laden ledges. Between the snapping of my
camera and the ice, which was now making the descent challenging, I was becoming excited with each
progressing step. After all, it was my first experience with an ice cave and as far as the formations
were concerned, they were truly amazing. Unlike limestone caves whose formations are not quite as
sharp and jagged, an ice cave is dramatic with its formations. It is not restricted to having trace
mineral deposits to compose its formations, but rather freezing water in as many shapes as water can
assume: sharp, spiraling, wide, varied in color, and geyser-like. These words can only begin to
describe the mountainous formations that awaited us. A white-milky color meant it was exceedingly
