searched. The mini-vini was waved through after Ekey's brief but expert impression of a dumb
tourista for the soldier. The mexi-taxi (Travis's car) also got a brief search, but with time, both of our
companion vehicles cleared the checkpoint. Anyway, we're hoping to get to the cenotes (like pits,
only wet) today, but as usual we got a late start from the beach, so we'll have to see. The beach was
a trip with the only downer being that we ran out of alcohol before I was sufficiently drunk and before
Aaron was on his knees praying for the stream of vomit to stop. Which reminds me, we must not
forget to hit up a deposito for tonight.

I hate them. Giant sacks of blood and bone, so heavy. They bring so much gear. They tell so
many lies. “This road won't be as bad”, “There shouldn't be any more bumps”, “I'll try and avoid
that sharp rock”. I tell you I am about seven topos away from losing my temper. What? I have to
change gears again?? God damnit, ok, ok, but you'll have to wait a minute.

Well we're making our final run for the border. Spent a night in Victoria, had an absolutely lousy
dinner. I think they picked the place based on Aaron's conclusion that they served both corona and
vampiro there. This conclusion was in turn based on Aaron's Spanish, which also led him to order a
hotdog when he meant to get soup. So my last Mexican beer will be a modelo in a can. Oh well. I'll
make it up to myself by stocking up on liquor at the El Walmarto we're going to hit before the border.
For now I'll be content with a high speed bouncy Mexican road, and a reoccurring cover of ‘Lime in
the Coconut by the Muppets that keeps running through my head.

UCT OF MEXICO stamp.
As we leave Mexico, it looks the same, burning and poor. But now I know I have to go back to
school and the sudo-real world of college. Why we ever leave Mexico, I dont know, but i think it has
something to do with being poor. I have learned this year that the lime is the best fruit in Mexico. The
mexican have Lime everything. It is in the chips, on the meat they cook, they put it in all the beer, the
even sell it in the mayonaise. From here on out, i will cook everthing with lime. I think the van breaks,
we will put lime on it and it will be just fine again.

I fear nothing.
We're back in the states. The minivinnie luck of avoiding searches ran out though. We alone got
pulled by US customs. But, aside from checking our ID's and having us pull a few bags out, they
searched nothing. A guy asked us a few questions about caving, decided we were genuine, and
passed us through. On the bright side, we had a few stray minutes to repack the car, plus, they forget
to charge us the tariff on our 6.75 liters of alcohol. Anyway, we're heading north now on Texas 77
with the Deighan car behind us and the Mexican taxi.. well, we're not quite sure where they are now.
But they should catch up when the minivan finally gives up the ghost and drops it tranny.
