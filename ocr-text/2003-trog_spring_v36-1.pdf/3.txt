A Word from the Editor
The 2002-2003 academic year proved to be a very exciting and memorable year in my life. I relocated
to Blacksburg from my rainy Seattle home (note: Blacksburg's annual rainfall seems to be equal to, if
not more than, that of Seattle), passed the first year of engineering at Virginia Tech, started dating a
great guy and then became the new editor of the Tech Troglodyte. Hooray for me! However, I think
this year was not only a success for me, but also for our grotto. As I was reading through all the
articles I received, I realized the extent of our success. There are 35 pages in the Trog this semester
(despite my best efforts to edit out the boring parts). The contents of these pages are just some of the
wonderful things the VPI Cave Club accomplished this year.
I've only been here for two semesters, but I feel like I've become part of my very own (somewhat
dysfunctional) family. I want to congratulate all the people I've met in the VPI Cave Club for being
who they are and express my gratitude for the knowledge and friendships offered to me. Enough
sappiness from me. I hope you enjoy the Trog. Please send me suggestions, comments and/or
criticism. DO NOT POST TO LISTSERV!! I hope to see everyone back at Tech next fall. Now be
gone!
