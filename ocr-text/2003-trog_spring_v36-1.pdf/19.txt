I would encourage the reader to play with these tools and feel free to add any other equipment they
think important to this short list. This is meant as only a minimum but bear in mind that if the “Crunch
Pack” gets too big it may not always make it to the dig where it may be needed quickly. If you need
something quickly you'll need it that much more.
These tools are for dealing with rock and in the case of an engulfment buried by loose materials, the
victim is more likely to suffocate from lack of air or an inability to breathe because of compression
from the engulfing materials. Obviously in these situations you will only have at most a few minutes to
act before the incident becomes fatal. Engulfment should be carefully guarded against as it is most
often fatal. Commercial excavators are bound by many safety rules as a result of hundreds of fatalities
from engulfment incidents.
Since diggers have higher risk than the general caving population (excluding divers) it would also
seem reasonable that they should gain some cave rescue knowledge and certainly some practical first-
aid training to offset this risk. If you find yourself needing to call for help in a dig accident the
combination of rescue training and digging skills seems far more likely to lead to a good outcome.
Besides the rescue community will gain from your participation and I believe you will too. I know
that the people that responded to my incident were far better diggers than rescuers and had I not been
able to direct my own rescue the outcome might not have been as favorable. If nothing else it would
have taken much longer, which in my case might have led to further damage to my right arm. This is
debatable of course and by no means meant as criticism. I was really glad they were there.
This leads me to the last big point I want to make in this paper and that is what cave rescue circles
refer to as “psychological considerations.” After I realized just how serious a situation I was in, I
became extremely focused on figuring out how to solve my dilemma. In retrospect this seems like a
defense mechanism and a good one at that. The greatest threat to that focus was the look of fear in
the eyes of my rescuers in the early stages. When I encountered this I could feel my resolve weaken
quite noticeably and only through sheer stubbornness was able to maintain my commitment to free
myself. Conversations about how bad things look are counterproductive to someone who needs help
obviously but your patient may pick up on your fear in ways that are more subtle. If possible this
should be guarded against. What is required is a kind of professional “can do” attitude grounded in
competence and the confidence experience yields. Fear has no place in rescue only because it tends to
degrade I.Q. and erode the necessary confidence a patient needs; concern on the other hand is the
reason anyone gets rescued, a thin and difficult line to walk.
I hope this has been of some use to you; my apologies for stating the obvious if it has seemed that
way. My intent was to share my experience and conclusions with you in the hope that my words might
spare someone this ordeal. DIG SAFELY!
Afterword
Since the events of 10/1/02, there have been two trips into what is indeed Maxwelton Sink Cave so all
our efforts have not been in vain. We are working on a new, more stable entrance at which time,
hopefully later this year, the cave will at last be open.
*Larry Fisher has made up 100 of these oak wedges which are available as a service to the digging
and cave rescue community at cost from BMS for $1 each plus shipping. Call 304-497-4311 for
