Dracula Country
By Aaron Thomas
I leaned back, feeling all the slack being consumed by my rappel device and slowly I began the
treacherous walk backward. In a moment such as this, I was thankful that I had double checked my
harness and rechecked the locking of my biner. For the truth was that I was not nervous because of
the apparent lack of crampons on my boots and the way my feet wanted to give way every time a step
was made, but rather by the simple fact, I had no way of knowing what was truly waiting for me at
the bottom of the world's second largest, underground glacier. Despite the descriptions by our eager
and mildly zany guide, Bogdan Onac, my introduction into the world of ice caving left me with a
feeling of unsettled anticipation. For while I was certainly excited, this was the first time I had ever
been into an ice cave let alone rappel down the side of a 10,000-year-old glacier.
As excited as I was, I could not help but think back a mere two months prior when this whole
trip was merely a vague outline. My tour into the heart of Dracula Country, Transylvania Romania,
happened almost by sheer serendipity, but it was an experience that left a profound respect for both
the universal hospitality of cavers and the exacting difference of caves and cavers in various parts of
the world.
In May of 2002, I had two very fortunate circumstances move into alignment. The first was the
good fortune to work for a company where I could make my own schedule and name my work
availability. The second was an invitation from an old friend to go touring with her in Eastern Europe
once she finished up teaching her Salsa (teaching English as a second language) classes in the Czech
Republic. So like any good caver, I immediately seized the opportunity to not only take an immediate
sabbatical from work but also to earn some impressive bragging points by caving in Transylvania,
Romania-Dracula Country.
The arrival of my friend Anita and I in Romania was enough of an adventure once you take into
account getting past customs with various scanner irritants known as caving gear and the stir we
caused at the University teaching Anita how to rappel and climb rope from her dormitory balcony. But
none the worse for wear, and having survived a long train ride (rumored to be frequently attacked by
bandits using sleeping gas in the ventilation system to subdue their prey), we arrived in Turda,
Romania early the morning of May 29th 2002. Here we met with Bogdan Onac from one of the fine
Romanian Universities and began the long journey to Garda. Two months before I had looked up
several caving groups in the area of Transylvania and Bogdan was one of the few to return my email.
It just so happened that he was leading a group consisting of students, scientists, and friends to some
classic Romania caves—such as Bear Cave and the ice cave of Ghetar-and was
kind enough to invite us along.
