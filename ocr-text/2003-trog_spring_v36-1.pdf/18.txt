The Scary Truth?
Dig long enough and something is going to fall on you! If you are VERY LUCKY you will simply
crawl out from under it or push it off of you with no ill effects other than a bad moment. If you are
JUST LUCKY, someone will be able to help get you out and you will recover EVENTUALLY...... If
you are NOT SO LUCKY, you will be rescued but will sustain permanent injury to one degree or
another, possibly after a long and miserable struggle involving many others. If you are UNLUCKY
you will DIE, maybe after a long and miserable struggle by yourself or with others trying to help you
but you will be dead and your rescuers, friends and family will suffer. Would a quick death help here?
Not anyone else but you.
I wouldn't deny this before the accident if asked but I wouldn't have written this then either. So if this
is the truth, and it is for me now, was I in denial or just ignorant? Will this be true for you after an
incident or is it true for you now after reading this? If not true to you now, are you in denial and if so
why would anyone want to cave or dig with you? These questions are rhetorical and need to be
answered privately first and then maybe discussed with others. At this point I believe that these are the
facts and they need to be faced.
In my mind facing these facts has not eliminated digging for me but it has convinced me that we need
to be prepared as best as we can to deal with these incidents quickly. We need to have some plan in
place before an emergency.
So It Happens and Someone is not VERY LUCKY
In any dig if there is a collapse, shift, etc. and someone is trapped, time will be of the essence
especially if they are pinned or otherwise in close contact with the passage. “Self rescue” should start
immediately by your party as well as alerting others outside the cave/dig to a possible callout. If you
have been digging for any length of time you have probably already performed some small self rescue
but do you have available equipment for the probable inevitability of a more serious event? Nearby?
Prudence would put some thought into what you might do well before an incident and have ready at
least some gear and expertise to deal with the problem quickly.
Besides the normal tools of the trade, i.e. dig bars, buckets, shovels, hammers etc., I would have
nearby what I am calling a “Crunch Pack.” This would consist of a durable bag containing at least_but
not limited to the following:
A) Two small mechanical screw jacks with handles found in small cars and light trucks. Small
hydraulic jacks do not operate well in all positions so they should be avoided. An exception to this
would be a “port-a-power” set which uses a remote pump. These tend to be large and not as
dependable as mechanical jacks but they can do some amazing things in a small space.
B) Twenty wooden wedges. A good size would be 3 inches wide by 8 inches long by 1 inch thick and
made from oak*. These wedges will allow shimming and wedging rock that may be unstable. They
also can back up progress made with jacks and be used to favorably position jacks when jacking
surfaces are slightly out of parallel. They can be used as cribbing when stacked in “opposition” to
themselves (thin end on fat end).
