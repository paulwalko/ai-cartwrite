conclusion that we had played some kind of environmental trump card to ruin their very profitable
deal. This of course was not the case and destroyed our chances to acquire access to the old entrance
property.
With no chance of gaining access to the original entrance and with most of the original survey data
either lost or of questionable accuracy, hope to gain an entrance to the cave seemed unlikely until Dr.
Dave Scott purchased property he believed overlaid sections of the cave. He expressed an interest in
trying to gain access to the cave below and digs were undertaken both manually and with mechanized
equipment (i.e. track hoe, financed by Dr. Scott). These digs were frustratingly unsuccessful and hope
of opening the cave waned until Jeff Bray started studying the area for microgravity anomalies. His
work indicated passage at a number of locations and a 6-inch test well was drilled at one of the most
promising spots. A modified black-and-white surveillance camera was lowered into the well and voids
encountered at 30 and 105 feet were remotely video taped. The 30-foot void did not seem particularly
promising but the 105-foot void contained larger passage and a stream flowing almost due north. This
corresponded with the existing map of the cave to indicate we had probably drilled into the Heaven
passage of Maxwelton Sink Cave.
One hundred and five feet straight down is a very long way to dig especially when it is mostly solid
limestone so it was decided to try a second dig with the track hoe. A spot about 100 feet south and
downhill from our drilled hole, which had indicated passage in the previous microgravity study, was
chosen. Digging proceeded well and at 38 feet down from the upper edge of the hole we found
breakdown with good air flow. Being at the limit of the reach of the track hoe we began digging by
hand in a mostly horizontal direction following the air.
Over the next several weekends an extremely dedicated dig team, of which I was a member, made
excellent progress. Traditional digging techniques were used to remove small rock and dirt and micro-
blasting was used to open spaces between the large breakdown blocks or reduce rock blocking our
progress to manageable sizes. By the end of September we had dug our way approximately 70 feet to
the top of relatively large passage with a stream running through it.
In the Blink of an Eye
On the evening of Oct. 1, Dr. Dave Scott, Jeff Bray, and myself, in a state of high expectation,
prepared to enter for the first time in 30 years what we believed to be MAXWELTON Sink Cave. I
took the lead and on our way in disturbed something which unleashed an avalanche of rock upon
myself. After kicking a number of smaller rocks off my legs I realized that my right arm and knee were
pinned by what I was soon to realize was a 1,000-pound-plus slab of breakdown. Pressure on my
right knee was not severe but I was unable to move it; pressure on my right arm between my elbow
and shoulder was extreme. My disbelief at the predicament very soon gave way to the harsh reality of
my situation. No amount of effort that I made even began to move the rock pinning me and although I
could move my right forearm and fingers my entire right arm was becoming progressively and
ominously numb. Luckily I remained conscious and Jeff went outside to call for help while Dave
stayed with me. My arm being subjected to so much pressure became the priority and we called for
the screw jack and handle from my Toyota pickup to be brought in. It soon arrived and with my free
left hand I placed it just above my right shoulder while Dave cranked the handle from his position in
the tight passage about three feet above me. Positioned horizontally between the wall of the passage
and the rock pinning my arm, the jack now shifted the rock slightly putting greater pressure on my
