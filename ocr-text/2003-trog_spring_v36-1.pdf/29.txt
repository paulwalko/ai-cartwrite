into the water, survived, and was glad that I did it. Okay, finally out of the city now after hours of
trying to get the group moving and on the road to El Tajin. Can't wait to see the pyramids and hope-
fully the weather will clear up or at least not rain. We are now on the Mexican superhighway that just
cost us 21 pesos but it is actually a divided 4 lane highway with a speed limit of 110 km/hr. Amazing.
Of course it would have been even more amazing if we had gotten on the road hours ago...at least our
car wasn't the girls of the trip this morning. And it gave us time to yet again see Mexico from the
rooftop. What a great country...

Leaving tamipux now for the pyramids on a Mexican interstate. The road is reasonably smooth,
but Mexicans still haven't quite grasped the concept of a limited access highway. There are numerous
right angle turns off the road, vehicles parked on the shoulder, and as I write this we have just passed
two improvised fruit stands. All this on an road that cuts dead straight across the county at 75 MPH.
The weather looks like its lifting now, which will hopefully make for a nice afternoon at the pyramids.
The group has once again gotten a late start, though thankfully not due to our car dragging ass. My
bowels feel a bit better today, though much of that is due to skipping breakfast. But apart from the
occasional need to repaint a toilet, I'm doing alright.

Ok, so i saw some old stuff. It didnt really look as good as new stuff, so I dont really know what
the big deal is. But Alison did find her dogs long lost brother. It even had a really nice prance. Then I
bought some hippie shit. Even better than old shit was the kick ass food we got in what ever the hell
town this is. Other than the good food, the coast of Mexico is dirty, crowed and lame. I met some
hippies from the land up north at dinner. They made me feel dumb because they could speak french,
english and spanish. Once again, the sun is setting, we have no place to camp and I need more beer.
The mini van found Travis, so thats good. Ekey still looks silly, Chris still has the bad shits, Alison has
my hat, and I have nothing more to say.

I am Ekye's feral facial hair. I am Chris's rageing bowels. I am Alison's undying optimism. I am
Eric's enduring negativity. I am MEXICO.

LOST all has gone to shit in the last 30 min. We lost Travis, lost John, found Travis, lost Travis
again, found John and now are looking for Travis, again. As Alison put it, “even a 5 year old can make
it back to the point they last saw their parents”. The same does not at all seem to be true of cars of 20
somethings in Mexico.
God save the king!

Pounding down the road for Victoria. Trying to keep Ekey's wild driving in check, but today he
is feeling chuffed. It doesn't help that deighan is setting a terrible example making numerous crazy
passes. The best was when he tried to pass a sedan, a truck, and a military check point in one go.
Apparently when you consider crossing against the solid line AND the cones, it angers the soldiers.
Luckily he swerved back just in time to have an animated chat with a gentleman in olive drab and get
