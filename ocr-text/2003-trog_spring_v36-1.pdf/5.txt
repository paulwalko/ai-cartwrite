Lost Promise is no longer LOST!
By Sandy Knapp & Philip Balister
Or rather, we now know ABOUT where it is on the surface. The Lost Promise passage, so aptly
named with its roots and moss and surface air smell just begging for an exit, has been the bane of
cavers for many years. After several grueling hours of crawling, a crack team of cavers, Matt Burnett,
Kathy Despains, Kara Smith, and Kevin Rock ended up in the back of Starnes Cave. Philip Balister,
Craig Ferguson, and Steve Wells were the surface group. Together, they determined that Lost Promise
is directly under a ravine filled with old barn roofing, about 50 ft. from the surface. How do they
know this?
Radio Location, location, location. Don't they say it's all about location? The equipment we used was
designed by Brian Pease, specifically for performing radio location of points in caves. An antenna and
transmitter are used to radiate a signal below ground, which is then monitored at the surface with an
antenna/receiver combination above ground. It sounds simple, but it takes a trained ear to 'hear'
where the underground signal is coming from and accurately locate the point on the surface directly
above the transmitter. This is known as ground zero. The receiver uses several design techniques so
that careful signal strength measurements can be made. From these signal strength measurements, the
distance between the in cave transmitter and the surface receiver can be calculated to give an accurate
depth.
The first problem we run into is that most waves; sound, light, radio etc., don't penetrate the ground
very far. Of course if this were really true, I wouldn't be writing this article. An electromagnetic wave
will penetrate into the ground for a distance called the skin depth. The depth is based on frequency (a
parameter). As the frequency is lowered, the skin depth increases. Using a frequency of 3.5 Khz and
good conditions, radio location has been able to accurately determine a cave depth of 565 ft. This was
at Jewel Cave in S. Dakota by Brian Pease.
Initial testing was at Pighole in Giles County, Va. With a vertical entrance of about 120 ft. we made
our first attempt at depth determination. Eileen O'Malley and Sandy Knapp positioned the 2’x 2
antenna at various places inside the cave. At each location, we would turn the transmitter on for a
predetermined time; long enough for Philip to zero in on the signal above ground by moving his
antenna so as to 'null’ the signal at ground zero. We know we are at ground zero when the surface
antenna is vertical and regardless the angle of rotation, the signal is minimized, or nulled as shown in
Figure 1. Unless you have very good information regarding the location on the surface where you
expect to find ground zero, hunting for ground zero can be quite challenging. You easily find one line
of position (LOP) at a point, however deciding which direction to travel in order to find ground zero
can be difficult. This decision is based on the angle the field leaves the ground and by finding a couple
of LOP's and deciding in which direction they converge. In his notes on his website, Brian Pease also
suggests starting uphill from the expected ground zero location.
The problem with the first trip was that there was no information we could use to compare to the
depth found by signal strength measurements. We needed more data to confirm the equipment was
operating properly and that we could interpret the readings correctly. On the next trip to Pighole, we
wanted some way to confirm our depth measurements. The way we overcame that was by doing both
a surface and in cave survey to connect the in cave radio location points with the corresponding
ground zero points on the surface. The underground crew of Eileen O'Malley, Kevin Rock, Mike
