9. Even if you don't miss school do you find your grades
suffering as a result of caving?
Many of us in C.A. used to blame our bad grades
on a lack of intellect instead of facing the fact that
caving ate up precious study time.

10. Do you tell yourself you can stop caving anytime you want ( )
to, even though you keep caving when you don't mean to?
Many of us kidded ourselves into thinking that we
caved because we wanted to. After we came to C.A.
we found that once we started to cave we couldn't stop.

11. Do you ever have black-and-blue-outs? (This is when you
wake up covered with bruises and don't remember exactly
how you got them.)
For all of us, this was an early sign of caveaholism.
Many of us who kept caving even woke up with
cracked ribs we couldn't explain.

12. Have you ever felt your life would be better if you did
not cave?
Many of us started to cave because caving
made life seem better, at least for a while.
By the time we got to C.A. we were trapped.
We were caving to live and living to cave.
What's your score? Did you answer yes four or more times? If so you are
probably in too deep with caving. But only you can decide if C.A. is for you. Try to
keep an open mind. C.A. does not promise to solve your problems but we can show you
how to stop caving "one day at a time.‚Äù We will be glad to help you. Just call.

I have a problem caving because I don't.)
