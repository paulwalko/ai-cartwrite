3. Have you ever partied heavily the night before a big

Most of us in C.A. have tried this trick but
the next day we always rationalized that you
should be hungover for a cave trip.

4. Do you envy people who can cave without getting hooked? ( )

5. Have you had any problems associated with caving
during the past year?
Be honest! Doctors say if you have a problem
with caving and continue caving it will get
worse - not better. Eventually you will die.
The only hope is to stop caving.

6. Has your caving caused a problem at home?
Before coming to C.A. most of us said it was
bad relationships or financial problems that made
us cave. We couldn't see that caving just made
everything worse.

7. Do you ever lock yourself in dark, windowless rooms with
your carbide lamp and drink until you see virgin passage?
This is a sure sign of Caveaholism. Many of us in
C.A. have done this when we couldn't cave for one
reason or another.

8. Have you missed days of work or school because of caving? ( )
Most of us admit now we “called in sick” when the
truth was we were caving or recovering from an
intense trip.
