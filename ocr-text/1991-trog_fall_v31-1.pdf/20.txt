or so (I'm sure Carol has the exact figure recorded somewhere) I stopped to set my first
station. All the anticipation came to a head and my blood started pumping. "MARK!"
I triumphantly screamed.
"Can't see that,” Mike informed me.
"Oh,” I commented. Unable to hang my head in shame (it was too damn tight)
I simply found a better spot, one that worked. I sat tight for awhile while all the
necessary labor took place on the other end. Shot number two was complete, and it was
time to move on. And move on I did, several feet before Mike's voice cut through the
exertion of crawling, "Where the hell is that last station?"
”On a rock, in the middle of the crawl. You should see it any time.”
"Is this it?”
"If I could see anything other than my pack and the wall on my immediate left
at the moment I would tell you, but alas..."
”Go a little further, Mike,” Carol answered from behind. He found the station,
and I pushed on, setting my second station.
"MARK!" The process was repeated and the third shot of the day was complete.
Time to move on... for a few more feet. I started noticing that every time I inhaled I
got pinched pretty tight, and couldn't move unless I exhaled. Looking ahead the
passage seemed to only get smaller (and as Mike later pointed out, was only going to go
if some serious digging took place.) So I decided it was time to back out. Dragging a
potpourri of equipment out behind me, I started in reverse, and didn't stop until I
started to notice a smell, a strong vapor, something like smoke... Lo, my lamp had
merged with my pack and flames had erupted. Brief moments of panic and speculation
followed. What if my dump bottle was to explode? How the hell will I get all this crap
out without a pack? Action was quick, as several quick breaths and a few sharp blows
from my free hand extinguished the blaze, leaving only a faint odor and a small hole in
the canvas of my pack. The rest of the crawl out of the lead was quick and uneventful,
and resulted in my sitting upright for the first time in what must have been forever (a
half-hour? an hour? Who can say?). The other lead Carol was looking for in the North
Subway couldn't be pinned down, and we left the cave, after an amazing three shots. -
At least we closed a couple of leads, and therefore accomplished a lot.
Of course there are those out there who might not think this survey trip stands
up to the legendary trips of yestreyear, or even some of the work going on under our
noses right now (like the now infamous lead in Starnes), but it was a start for me, and if
nothing else the trip was great fun. Hell, maybe now I'm qualified enough to invest in a
bat sticker for my bike ( alas I own no bumper ). -
