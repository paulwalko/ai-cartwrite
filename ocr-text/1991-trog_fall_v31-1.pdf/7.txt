Jake and Bryce will be co-oping and going away, while Mark and Adam will be coming
back to take their places. Maurya will therefore be single for the first time since her
arrival at Tech...so get your dance cards punched while there's still time! Rob French
got a real treat on a trip to Newberries as Colleen Ko got her hair stuck in her rappel
device and had to sit on his face to get it out. This year's practice rescue went off
without a hitch due to Ed and Jerry's expert help in organization. Kathi was the
victim and the whole thing took just over three hours.
Maurya Fisher is banquet chairperson this year and things are progressing as
always. Like last year, it will be held in Owens Banquet room on February 15. Hoss is
the prize chairman, so send your suggestions to him. Chris Stine is the tentative
speaker of the house assuming he returns alive from China.
