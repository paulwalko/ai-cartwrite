GROTTO GRAPEVINE
This summer was somewhat slow...nothing of any great excitement occurred.
We did lose our long time co-patriot and past editor, beer- maker and all around cute
dude, Joe â€™Puke' Uknalis. Yes folks, he did again what got him to Blacksburg in the
first place...he made the fatal mistake of following a woman. This time it was Heather
Godsey, and they are both up in Philadelphia. This is just in time it seems, however,
since his ex-wife, M.K., is back in town and is car-pooling with Theresa Croft. Doug
Bruce made this summer when he had a minor error with his vehicle. Being too busy
playing with the lingerie later found in his car, he made a turn too quickly and met a
bridge at an inconvenient time, subsequently ending the life of his Chevy. It is worth
mentioning that several pieces of vertical gear were seen making appearances as
U.F.O.s.
At O.T.R. we saw the return of Larry Lifesaver, who is now out of the Navy and
back in Blacksburg; maybe thinking of school? Mr. Perkins unveiled his newest
purchase, two enormous speakers that entertained the VPI club tarp. We saw Brian
Emery's reaction to too much alcohol as he passed out nude under someone's van.
Kathi Ireland showed up in her new car, a Mitsubishi Montero. Pete Sauvigne whipped
out his water balloon slingshot and started bombarding the porta johns down the road
as people went, in and out. Whilst Ko, Joan, and Scott were in the sauna area they
glimpsed a couple fornicating pretty heavily on the dam...Hmm...I wonder what her
kids thought when they swam out to her while she was in the throes of passion? Even
Kristen Posson was seen for a brief time at the sauna section, au natural even. For the
accommodation of aging cavers a spacious new sauna is on the drawing board. Paul
Kirchman did an excellent job as O.T.R. Commander in chief, is it possible that he will
continue? It also came to our attention that Paul had something else come to attention
during a co-ed shower with Maurya and Judy. During the more wine party many of the
VPIers were seen clustered around Head Guru Bob Cohen and Dr. Erlenmeyer. Gate
Nazi Ed got some assistance from the local police department at night... I wonder if he
took off the helmet? The Elvis Grotto created a stunning sensation with the Odyssey
2001 Disco Tent. Polyester was the name of the game, unless, of course, you came
dressed in your original birthday suit as some folks did. After the Disco Tent ended
Paul Hess was seen talking to a tent for about a half hour. 'In competition news, Sara
and Nat won awards for 30 meter mechanicals, Lesley won 1st place in the obstacle
race, Chase placed in 30 meter mechanicals and Dave placed in the surveying
competition. Mark Eisenbutts was the award chairman and did an excellent job...some
