IS C.A. FOR YOU?
The Story of Juan the Pirate
His caving started out innocently enough - on occasional weekends when he had
the time. But soon that wasn't enough. He lived for the feeling of power and strength
he got from climbing sheer rock walls. He fed on the respect and admiration of fellow
cavers. He felt that as long as he caved the trainees would continue to worship him.
He began caving every weekend and soon every weekday. He lost his job, his home, his
friends. He took to hanging out with other cavers - people who shared in his sickness.
One day someone pointed out that he might have a problem with caving. They invited
him to a meeting of Caveaholics Anonymous, a non-profit group of men and women
who share their experiences and help each other recover from caveaholism. But Juan,
suffering from the classic symptoms of denial, replied “Well, if you think about it, I
don't have a problem. I can quit any time I want to.”
Have you heard yourself saying this to friends of family? Then maybe
Caveaholics Anonymous is for you. We who are C.A. came because we finally gave up
trying to control our caving. We found out from other C.A. members that we were sick.
We decided to face up to what caving had done to us. Here are twelve questions. Try to
answer them honestly. See how you do. Remember, there is no disgrace in facing up to
the fact that you have a problem.

1. Have you ever decided to stop caving for a couple of
weeks, but only lasted for a couple of days?
Most of us in C.A. made all kinds of promises
to ourselves and our families we couldn't keep.
C.A. taught us: Just try not to cave today.

2. Do you wish people would mind their own business
about your caving - stop telling you you're getting
carried away with it?
In C.A. we don't tell you what to do. We talk
about our own caving and how we stopped. We'll
help you if you want us to.
