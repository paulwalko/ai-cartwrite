WHAT'S A CAVE MOTHER TO THINK?
OR A MORAL DILEMMA!
If you haven't noticed, there is a strong move a foot in our society to equate
legality with morality. Well, this issue of legality - I mean morality - was brought to
the fore at Cave Club Halloween party time when the threat of a raid was rumored. As
the prospective hostess, I am not into police work (and I've yet to meet a person in
Blacksburg who would interest me in it). Also, I didn't want to spend my valuable
time in criminal court defending myself for not doing something about something that I
feel is none of my business.
So I asked for advice (semi-legal) on the situation (being truly selfish but totally
and absolutely truthful, the party would be moved before I would agree to do police
work or spend my valuable time in court).
I was advised to alternately and loudly announce (at the party) that I would not
(and did not) supply alcohol to persons under 21, that I didn't want anyone else do so,
and that I didn't "believe” in anyone under 21 drinking. I related this advice to
someone who then remarked, “Why, Cecile, I didn't know you disapproved of anyone
drinking.” This person apparently also highly correlated legality (and my willingness to
cover my ---) to morality!*
. What is a mother to think! B.K. turned 18 in 1982 when legal drinking age was,
(guess what?) 18, so it was moral for me to watch him chug down a beer.
In July 1, 1983, it became illegal to drink spirits unless one was 19 or over. Now
B.K.'s birthday wasn't until July 6, so that for 6 days I was in a moral dilemma (not
legal - he was Grandfather claused in). Because it wasn't nice for my 18 year old son to
be drinking beer - July 6 came and I could again breathe easily - I was again upholding
society's standards.
However, two years later, the state legislature affirmed that “Yes, Virginia, you
shall have federal tax money to improve your highways" and succumbed to agreeing
that it was terrible for anyone under 21 to drink alcohol, (also illegal). It was more
than a mother can tolerate. From July 1st, 1985 till 12:01 a.m. on the 6th I lived in
dread of others discovering my improper immoral attitude - I really didn't give a damn
that B.K. most probably was quaffing a beer or two now and then. The 6th came
without event, but I live in dread that the legislature will tamper with “legal age” and
age 28 will be the next target - I'm out of here!!

* Let it be known however that I do not believe in anyone under 21 drinking then driving
and No, I won't bail you out.
