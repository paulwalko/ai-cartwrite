Coming From The Sticks
It was strange coming to cave at Tech after having caved for a few years in
Elkins, West Virginia. There was a drastic difference between what I was used to and
the way the club caves. Over the past few years I have run into a few people who were
in the same situation and it seems like most of the caving communities outside of Tech
caved the way I used to. Therefore, I figured my observations were worth mentioning.
Ok, so here's a typical caving scenario before I came to Tech. The group I caved
with consisted of me and four of my close friends. When we went caving we would
always cave together, mostly because there was nobody else to cave with. This is not
saying that there aren't any other cavers in Randolph county (a lot of Old Timers
would have my hide for saying that), but in Elkins we were about it. It was a lot harder
to get information about caving. The way we found out about caves was through the
few Old Timers that we could drag into they're favorite caves once in a while. We
learned vertical techniques from books like On Rope and from stuff like the NSS's
Nylon Highway. That is also another way we located caves. The bulk of our
knowledge, however, came from the 1984 Convention guide or the West Virginia Caver.
When we went caving we went by these maps and after some practice they even made
sense. I'd like to emphasize that we weren't flashlight cavers. We wore helmets with
trash bags in them and had three sources of light and so on, but more importantly, I
would say we knew how to cave safely. We stayed safe by knowing what we couldn't
do. When we went caving there was no one in charge and no one followed. We each
knew how much the others knew so there was no need for that. When we rigged a drop
or made any other decision things were done democratically. We also had a rule that if
for any reason any one of us could cancel a trip if they felt it wasn't safe.
Then I came to Tech and all of a sudden I was a 'trainee'. When I went on
caving trips I usually followed members around with them doing all the rigs and such. I
understood that it was necessary to have it this way since most of the people coming
into the club were new cavers and there is no way of knowing what they know without
a training program. However, it was hard to adjust to this. I'm glad that I went
through the training program finally because I feel like I've learned a few things. At
the same time it seems that in the time that I've been caving here I've seen some
people (such as my old roommate Grady Humble and some good TAG cavers) that
found themselves in the same predicament here at Tech. Maybe this will help people
understand why it is hard to come into the trainee program at Tech without me
sounding negative towards the club.
