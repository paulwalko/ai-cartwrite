it, so the first dig got named the “Hydraulic Press”. It reminded Kirk of the final scene
in The Terminator. I thought of my ribs and named the second pinch ”Rib-tickler”.
We continued along, still following the air flow. We would crawl a bit and then walk a
bit... Then we came to an intersection. One way went straight, the other went up.
We followed the air, and the air went up.
The passage changed character, now it was a twisting, windy, uphill duck-walk. :
I was leading and it was almost possible to stand up straight. I stopped and heard
water dripping, and it sounded like it was a continuous reverberating trickle that was
falling for some distance. I yelled with excitement and we ran ahead to a small
opening overlooking trunk passage. I yelled some more and we dropped into a 15' by
25' passage. This was it, my first big discovery. Our first major discovery. We
couldn't resist the temptation and scooped in one direction for several hundred feet.
With great reluctance we decided we had to go back, but we didn't want to go back
through those crawls! We had to think of a good name for it since it is such a pain in
the ass.
When we arrived back in known passage, Kirk and I reflected on our near state
of exhaustion and thought about what still had to be done to get out. Then it hit Kirk,
and we named the crawl ”Humble Pie”. How appropriate. It always seems you get a
big slice of it upon exiting.
We got out of the cave around dawn. As we were packing up, Mr. Price drove
by and we waved at each other. He was probably laughing at those crazy cavers. After
ten hours of hard, fast caving, Kirk and I were tired out. We were, however, very
content with our discovery. As I drove home one sole thought kept echoing in my
mind... Damn if I don't have to be at work in five hours.
