In the relationship department we have marriages abounding! My long time
friend and secret lover Ko Tak has forsaken me for Joan Johnson and will be married in
the spring, and each will take the other's name. Doug Bruce will be wedded to Sue
Setzler sometime in the near future and will go on to create a new race of super tots.

dance, although at present Gerald is the only taker. Bob 'Handy' Handley seems to
