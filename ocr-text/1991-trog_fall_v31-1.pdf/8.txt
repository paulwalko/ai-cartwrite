THE DISCOVERY OF THE STARNES EXTENSION
It was the first weekend in June and I wanted to do some caving. Kirk was
eager to get his last few. bits of his training signed off, so we were looking for a third to
do a vertical trip. Unfortunately we had no luck. I told Kirk not to worry, that we had
all summer to take care of it. What to do?
Well, I thought about Starnes. Kirk had not been there, and I recalled Psycho
telling me about a dig there, so I figured, why not? After talking to Barry Price that
evening and mentioning to him how Kirk hadn't been there, we decided Starnes it was.
We took a brief tour of the upper trunk. It's nice and big, just the way I like my
cave passage. After that we headed towards the lower sections. While down there we
decided to check out the dig and then do the rest of the lower section and maybe go see
the belly flop.
I followed Psycho's directions to the lead. The dig was actually a couple of
hundred feet inside the lead. We stopped right before we entered it, and noticed our
breath being wicked away in the direction of the dig. I grew eager and said to Kirk â€œI
think it goes, and I think it goes big. There is way to much air flow for it not to."
We pushed into those wonderful crawls. They were small, but nothing horrid.
After checking a small, tight, dead-end lead, we located the first of the many digs that
had been done by Lawerence Britt and the rest. We kept thinking about how much
digging had already been done, and why it had not been finished. After all, there WAS
a lot of air flow.
After a particularly tiring up-hill crawl we came to what had looked like were
the digging stopped. There was station marker 'TI' in the mud, right by the low crawl
where the air was being sucked. I beeped into the crawl and then looked into it. Dirt
floor, a little to tight, but a little digging took care of that. After about ten minutes of
easy digging and a little bit of exhaling, we had pushed into a room about eight feet in
diameter. It was virgin passage, we could tell.
We were both excited. The air was still moving big time. In a fit of excitement,
we wrote our initials and the date on a mud bank. I guess in our excitement we didn't.
notice that our date was wrong. It wasn't till till a few trips later that I finally noticed
and corrected it. We pushed on through the next crawl, wind at our backs. Then we
hit a mother of a tight spot. Kirk and I had agreed to alternate leading, after all, it
isn't every day you see virgin passage. Kirk, therefore, came to the next tight spot.
This one was tougher, and it required the breaking of rock to circumvent it. He
managed to squeeze through and I followed. Boy, was it tight!
