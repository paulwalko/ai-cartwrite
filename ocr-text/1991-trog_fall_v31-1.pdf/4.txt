VEEP COLUMN

just say its been. With Academic Discipline, I should be taking lots more trips. My
thanks to those who have given me a hand. Should anyone need an additional bridge
session or trip, just let me know and I'll take care of it for you. Special congratulations
should go to our six new members:

Scott Broadwell 331
Natalie Serbu
Jerrod Leland
332

Here's looking forward to a better year......

Message From The Gods Themselves
We now think we know what the past GODS went through... the countless
sleepless nights, six gallons of Visine and two cases of No-Doz. It doesn't work. Ever.
Let us get that straight right off the bat. However, a case of Homebrew and the
Swedish Bikini Team doing deep throat exercises all through the night never hurt
anyone, at least it certainly didn't hurt us :-) After the deep pulsing sounds of
Metallica stopped and the Laser Printer made its final chirp, we turned on our now
fixed T.V. and tuned into Super Mario Brothers. As Mario and Luigi leaped over
vicious mushrooms we thought about how nice a cup of tea sounded and so we snapped
our fingers, and just the way we thought GODS should be treated, a stunning blonde
brought us a cup. Two cups actually. Both of em' about 36 C but not quite steaming
hot. Yet, that is. Hmmmm...
