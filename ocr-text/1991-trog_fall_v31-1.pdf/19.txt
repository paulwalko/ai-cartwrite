Three Shots at Glory
So I'm sitting here, unable to sleep, and the debate rages: what distinguishes a
true caver from a sport caver. How do you move from being a spelunker who dawns his
electric justrite and enters Tawney's, never breaking a sweat and never straying from
the tourist route, to being hardcore and pushing leads in virgin cave, doing the
impossible climb... and the impossible crawl. I'm sure the paths to this level of caving
are numerous, but perhaps one sign points down the road of mapping. Just recently I
had my first taste in the art of cave surveying, and took my first steps away from being
little more than a glorified nerd caver (better equipped, probably more skilled, and
certainly more ethical, but still having the ultimate goal of just getting in, seeing what
there is to see, and getting out) to being a pure caver, heart and soul.
It all started while hanging out at one of the informal summer meetings.
“So, anyone want to go caving?” The questioning voice of Carol Zo broke
through the typical B.S. being tossed about, and damn if I'm not looking to cave. A
survey trip you say? Hey, I've never been...
“We'll teach you," Carol reassures me, and the plans are set. I'm to meet Mike
Mike Mike in the morning, which I do, and were to meet Carol in Dublin, which we also
do, but only after suffering through a short ride in Mike's car, who's smell had been ·
complemented by Mike's significant other demonstrating her overindulgence the night
before by, to be tactful, puking all over the place. At any rate, we make it to Skydusky
Hollow, stopped by to say hello to Buddy (who wasn't home), and after leaving a note
and giving our best to Sadie Banes and her grandchildren, made our way to Newberries,
where we were to chart miles upon miles upon miles of unexplored, virgin passage.
We leisurely made our way into the cave, stopping now and then to do some
gossiping, to rig a cable ladder, to do some more gossiping, change carbide, point out
things of interest (it being my first trip into Newberries and all. “And here you have
Triple Wells, and this you're climbing is the Devil's Staircase....”), maybe tell a story or
two, and, well... you get the picture. We found the spot Carol had in mind, and got to
work. As she had said earlier, this was to be a mop up trip of sorts, clean up a few
leads, maybe find some new ones: A great opportunity to learn. After finding the last
station, Carol and Mike demonstrated what was going on. I was to be lead tape, being
the least experienced and all, and Mike showed me what that entailed. They did shot
number one and pointed me in the direction of the lead, a small crawl, measuring about
the diameter of my helmet, turned on its side, in height. No problem. With tape in
teeth, lamp in hand, and pack being pushed ahead, I attached my stomach to the floor
and started squirming. Into the crack I went. Somewhere around the first twenty feet
