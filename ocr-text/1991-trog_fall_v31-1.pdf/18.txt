LITTLE WEENIES
Amaze your friends at parties! Spread stories of how you exposed your Little
Weenie in front of hundreds of people, creating screeches of joy and excitement! Little
Weenies are great fun for those seeking unusual thrill and adventure.
To create your Little Weenie:
1.
Cut two to five inches of rope and burn the head of the Weenie to prevent fraying.
You'll find that a little Weenie has excellent control and precision whereas Weenies
longer than five inches are sluggish and are hard to raise above any angle greater
than ten degrees.
2.
Pull the control strands out of the base end of the Weenie.
3.
Burn the hairs off the base of the Weenie. If you don't, the Weenie will burst
under stress.
4.
Remember,
You may want to color-code your Weenie so you don't lose it.
everyone who sees your Weenie will want it!

It takes practice to know your Little Weenie. Upon first use, the Weenie may
twitch in unexpected directions. Do not be disappointed! Once you've mastered the
Weenie's controls, it will provide hours of enjoyment.
To get the most from the your Weenie, treat it with care. If Little Weenies are
jerked too hard, they produce unexpected results and quickly lose sensitivity. When
carefully maneuvered, Weenies perform a long time without a hassle. Don't abuse your
Weenie, or it will abuse you!
