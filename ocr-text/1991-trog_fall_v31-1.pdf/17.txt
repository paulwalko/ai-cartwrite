ELVIS SEEN AT ELVIS GROTTO MEETING
At the last Elvis Grotto meeting members were stunned to notice that the King
himself made an appearance. It was not until the meeting was brought to order that
His Presence was fully realized by the way he vocalized the Grotto's chant, “Uhuh
Uhuh Uhuh”. As Elvis' voice rang true, members turned and offered the King sips from
their Lemon Elvises and other trinkets such as free passes to the Disco Tent and
coupons worth $10,000. When asked about his whereabouts for the past few years Elvis
replied “Whalll ya'll, ya see I got this here job workin' for the state of Idaho as a road
repair supervisor. The only reason I've come out of hidin' is to thank all ya'll for
rememberin' me in this fashion.". In the picture below Elvis poses with the Grotto co-
chairpeople.
