Spool Daze
The double spools used in rope running competitions scare the piss oá»¥t of me...
they always have. To watch me running a spool for practice climbing is to watch the
early stages of ulcer formation. To see me running one for racing is to understand high
blood pressure. The double spool is certainly a specialty item and you don't see many
of them around but they are there. They are wonderful for competitions because of
their smooth operation and controllability. They do not, however, tolerate inattention
of any sort.
The most obvious way to rig one is to simply wrap the top spool, then wrap the
bottom, always wrapping out, or away from the vertical support bar. (Fig. 2) This is
the most dangerous way to rig the types of spools I am familiar with because if the rope
pops out of the lower controlling bars, it can fling itself off of both spools in no time
flat. This is especially true if you run the spool from several feet away.
Being the worrying sort, I always wrap the second spool back in towards the
support bar. (Fig 1) I do this by pre-forming the reverse loops in my hand slipping
them over the spool. A spool rigged this way still requires the same amount of
attention to provide a smooth ride but if the rope pops off the lower bars, the result is
very different. The same twisting and flinging which dumped your friend on the ground
before now tends to knot up and jam the spool (assuming, of course, that you don't
drop the rope entirely but in that case all bets are off anyway). In the scenario the
runner hits the pulley, yells at you, and you may need help to unknot the spool. Very
embarrassing .... but you didn't break someone's legs.
As usual there are many other equally safe ways to rig spools. This works for
me. No matter what sort of gear you use for your vertical work, play with it. Rig it
right, rig it wrong, try to make it fail so that you can understand failures. Anticipate
the mistakes you WILL make someday. Think now... it's good practice and someday,
somewhere, when your thinker goes off line for a while, you may only have to
remember.
