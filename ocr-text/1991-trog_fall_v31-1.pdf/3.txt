PRESIDENT'S COLUMN
Well folks, I guess you could consider this my ”State of the Club” speech type
thing, so here goes...
First of all, I'd like to send my congrats to the new members of the club - Kirk,
Sandy, Scott, Nat, Jarrod, and Rob. To all the trainees - Keep up the good work.
In other news, yours truly is now famous for the screw-up in Fern. Check out
the November 1991 NSS News. At least I didn't have to do a TV interview.
. The club is doing lots of survey work this semester. The caves include Buddy
Penley's, Straley's, Links, and Starnes. Work is also being done in Green Valley, and of
course I should mention the Ohio cavers and their secret caves.
The club agreed to adopt the highway in front of Tawney's cave to route 42.
Conservation work is being focused on Tawney's. Thanks to all who have helped so far.
We are officially the "VPI Cave Club” by a recent unanimous vote. This was prompted
by the passing of a motion to stop work on incorporating the club.
As for some final words... There seems to be a bit of tension running through
the club this semester. Please try and remember that we are a group that is bound
more or less by the common love of caving. We are a close knit group, and we must
remember not to let bad feelings get in the way of good judgments. When you are
underground keep in mind who members are, who leaders are, and who is experienced.
Listen to those with greater knowledge than your own, learn from your past mistakes.
Trust me, as I learned in Fern, there are better ways of doing things. Keep lines of
communication open, and be open to criticism - no one is perfect.
Since we are a social group, we are plagued with it's problems. Most prominent
among them is gossip, and we are all guilty of it. A lot of the time it is done in fun,
sometimes to find out the truth of an event when the facts are unclear. Can it be
avoided? To some degree, I think it can. Being honest and open will always help.
Caving is a team sport. Always keep that in mind. People's lives depend upon
each other underground. Most of the time you need 100% of your mind and body to get
the job done, and get it done right.
. I hope I haven't been to preachy, but I think some of these things needed saying.
To many people this club is a second family, to others a first. Let's try and keep it that
way.
In closing, how am I doing? Let me know, because I like to get advice and
criticism. Thanks to all those who have given it already.
DAVE
