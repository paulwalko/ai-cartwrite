AN INTERVIEW WITH
"AWESOME BILL FROM DAWSONVILLE"
AKA
ALEX BOOKER, TRAINEE OF THE YEAR
DAN "JOKER" CROWDER
(AND SARA FLEETWOOD)
So here we are at Filthy Young Women and I'm
sitting next to the legendary trainee of the year Alex
“Awesome Bill from Dawson Ville” Booker. He is just
taking time to do this article between bore scooping ses-
sions. He is sitting in the living room recovering and it's
raining outside. His back hurts and he says his shirt smells
awful in true Alex Booker fashion. Pearce Cooper is put-
ting his pants on in the corner and Sara Fleetwood is sit-
ting there judging me. First question.
Joker: When did you start caving?
Alex: I was a wee boy of 24. I went into Tawney's with
my sister. I mostly came to the parties until I went to
Mexico and saw the big pits and wanted to violate them.
Now I have become THE member and I cave weekly.
Joker: That's interesting, how do you feel scooping bore?
Alex: Scooping Bore! It's dirty, it hurts and you gotta do it. But it's a lotta fun.
Joker: What is your favorite cave.?
Alex: I've only been in it twice, but Newberry Banes.
Sara: And why?
Alex: One, Triple Wells. Lots of rigging and nuisance drops.
Carol then came in and we debated about Triple Wells or Bill's. Alex liked the Devil's
Staircase and said he liked going up it. He rappels down and takes the staircase back up. He
wants to do the through trip with Banes.
