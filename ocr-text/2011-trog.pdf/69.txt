WALL
Boxing! Only downside to
this is getting punched out
into the fire. Okay, not into
but near enough for your
friends to go “oh shit!” and
quickly pull you out. Box-
ing Mark may be a bad
idea.
Letting Naomi drive your
car may also be a bad idea.
Going down the tyrolean
topless? Beth wants to try it
too of course.
UNA
Drunkenly singing along to
Kirk's guitar playing? Yes.
Cavers doing what cav-
ers do best, climbing
sketchy shit. Look! It's
a seesaw!
And of course caving!
Woot Newberyy Banes.
Only downside is those
cavers missed the Dairy
Queen Run. :( Come
on, 45 minutes isn't too
long to drive for ice
cream.
