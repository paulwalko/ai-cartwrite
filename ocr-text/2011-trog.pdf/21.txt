and I was on my way.
Epiloge: Later on that first fall, I was on a mapping trip with a guy named Ed Bauer. The trip
was very cold and wet and periodically Ed startled me by suddenly and violently exhaling with
a loud “harrumph!” I asked him what that was all about, and he told me that he did that to shake
off chills. Ed also told me that he learned that trick the year before when he and some others
had been trapped in a cave for a couple days by rising floodwaters.
Epiloge 2: The story about Ed and his companions being trapped in the cave is now immortal-
ized by the song “Stuck in Cruikshanks Cave.”
Song to the tune of “Folsom Prison Blues”

Crookshank's Cave

I hear that river flowin', it's flowing 'round the bend.
And I ain't seen the sunshine, since I don't know when.
Well I'm stuck in Crookshank's Cave,
And time keeps draggin' on.

And that river keeps a flowing, on down to Charleston.
Well when I was just a baby, my daddy said one day,
"Don't go climb on mountains or mess around in caves."
Well I'm caving down in Blacksburg, to pass the time away.
How much longer must I stay here, 5611 maybe one more day.
Well I bet their back in Blacksburg, drivin' 'round in cars.
Eatin' in the mess halls, and smokin' big cigars.
Well I know I had it comin', I know I can't be free.
But that river keeps a-risin', and that's what tortures me.
Well if I get out of here and I see that old sunshine.
You bet I'd move it on down a little farther down the line.
Far from Crookshank's Cave, that's where I want to stay.
And I'd let that Greenbrier River, wash all my blues away.
