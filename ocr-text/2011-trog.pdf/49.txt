“How are we going to get back up?" Courtney asked.
“Hang on to my pack.” Deighan instruct-
ed.
John and Courtney latched on to opposite
sides of the cave pack and hung on tightly.
Deighan approached the side of the cave as if
he'd free climbed it before, finding hand and
foot holds on apparently flat rock. After a mere
ten minutes the three reached the top of the cave
and assessed the havoc that awaited them. Sa-
mantha fought off one cartel member with a fry-
ing pan while Phil growled angrily at it from be-
hind her. Brian tried to negotiate with another
while Alex and Deborah beat the third with vari-
ous pieces of cave gear. Deighan lifted himself,
John, and Courtney out of the cave to join the
fight. In broken Spanish Courtney tried to bribe
the cartels with beer to get them to leave.
John does love his beer.
“No! Not the beer!” yelled John.
Deborah looked up to see Deighan perched in a tree, prepared to attack from above. “El
Deigo?” she asked confused.
In one quick leap Deighan, the silverback gorilla, attacked, trapping all three cartel
members against the ground. The others worked together to tie the members together. With an
og easy push, Deighan launched them
down the pit and the group heard faint
screaming followed by a thud.
A few seconds of silent shock
were followed by whooping and cheer-
ing of the group and of the civilian
Mexicans who watched the fight.
Deighan stood carelessly a few feet
away from the pit and the others looked
at him with astonishment. They gath-
ered around Deighan in a circle and
bowed down on their hands and knees.
Once again El Deigo saves the day.
Brian comes out barely alive, or maybe just
hungover.
