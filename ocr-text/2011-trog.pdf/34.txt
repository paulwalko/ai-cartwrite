A little more of the story,
The incident happened sometime around 3
or 4 pm. The trapped person and friend
tried to get the guy out themselves for an
hour or so before calling the Giles county
squad for help. I think the friend probably
called 911. So the Giles squad and/ or New-
port squads were first on scene, I think they
said about 6 or 6:30.
So the real question is why the Giles folks
did not call the cavers. Maybe Zenah's
comments are the answer there.

Then sometime before 8 pm Wil's friend,
living near the cave called Wil and Zenah
to let them know about the rescue. At the
same time the Blacksburg squad was called.
Wil called a few people, including Steve
Wells and Joe Zo, (and yes we were at the
Underground so the word spread)
I asked the Blacksburg folks on scene about calling the cave club and they said that was the first
thing Blacksburg thought of - and they called Sam.
A few comments since we have not had a call out in a while. We usually have a call out person
who's job is to stay on the phone and call people as needed. Zenah has done this a lot in the past
and maybe we need to be better organized about it again. Usually in a rescue not everyone is
called out. You start with a team or two, or the amount you think is needed to help. Then the
next team or two are called for standby - that means get your gear together, stop drinking if it is
a party night, and wait to be called. This way more folks know what is going on and are ready if
needed.
This rescue was different being an entrance situation and a confined space problem. The guy's
head was actually outside the drip line of the entrance.
When Wil left to go to the scene I think he was just going to find out if it was a cave rescue or
not. He did call a few of us who went home to grab gear and help out. I called Wil on the way
to see if he needed help and he was still trying to figure that out. So Joe and I continue to the
