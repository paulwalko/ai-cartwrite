more insight into this cave project. Caving is more than a recreational sport but also an ongoing
research activity. Wil explained, “The awareness of results of such projects can be helpful in
making the argument for the protection and responsible management of cave and karst re-
sources. For instance, imagine if you converted the Ferrell Dairy (where James Cave is) into a
subdivision with roads and lawns. Typically, runoff would be channeled to stormwater basins,
which would most likely be discharged to sinking streams. Such features bypass the epikarst
drip systems, and would severely alter the dynamics of subterranean water flow, affecting
spring discharges and groundwater levels.”
This long-term project would not be possible without help from graduate students, un-
dergrads, and cavers like you! I would encourage others to participate and get involved in cave
research.
