It was pretty crazy with the number of rescue people there. Turns out Sam went out with the
ambulance and was the first caver there. She is also small enough to just crawl through the up-
per part of the entrance - so in she went. Joe, Wil and I had a hard time even getting to the cave
entrance because of the number of rescue folks gathered around. Luckily, as Wil said, lots of
people know Wells so when he showed up the way was parted to let Steve enter the cave (he is
also very small and could go through the top).
Wil had also talked to Mike Ficco who showed up with rock drills, and was also small enough
to fit, so in he went.
At this point Joe decided to get his gear and rig himself to a tree above the cave entrance so he
could see what was going on and lend a hand for rigging and pulling up. John Bowling joined
him. Mike Futrell
also arrived about
this time.

tient, but the Va Tech squad found a person for that job first.
One interesting point, by about midnight the rescue folks started retreating to warm vehicles,
