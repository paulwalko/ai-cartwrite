Wow, that's a more impressive resume than some of our newly elected congress persons
have ;-)
And what are lifetime memberships going for?

Hi Robyn,
I am pleased to offer you Life Membership in the VPI Cave Club! No recommendation is
necessary, and your list of accomplishments is quite impressive. The only one I don't
recognize is DTC. Wikipedia tells me it might be one of these:
- Delaware Theatre Company
- Delhi Transport Corporation
- Diamond Trading Company (De Beers)
If it is the latter, then Life membership will cost you $100,000,000 in uncut diamonds
(blood free). Otherwise please send a check for $100 to this address:
VPI Cave Club
P.O. Box 558
Blacksburg, VA 24063-0558
Please make the check payable to VPI Cave Club.
Contrary to rumor, the club still offers life membership. The constitution posted here says
so:
