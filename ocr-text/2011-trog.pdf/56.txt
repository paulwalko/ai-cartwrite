CAVING (LINKS)
HILLARY SCHMITTHENNER
Entrance,
Cold dark icicles encircle my way.
Just a bit further,
And warm clay formations.
The nasty,
Stuck, frightened, hopeless.
Will I ever get out?
Drag my foot that way.
Slide my hand that way,
My butt's trying to slide up,
My knees are wiggling.
Stop. Give up. I'll die here.
Encouragement, crying, half a handstand.
Finally! A break through,
I'm not squished anymore.
I did it.
Now cannoning, crawling, climbing,
The rest of the cave is better.
Breathing, sweating, straddling a rock,
My, this is exhausting.
Oh no! I'm stuck again.
But a leg up, and I'm in another room.
Formations like chandeliers glaze the walls.
Another room to go to,
But my butt's too big and round.
A little slithering up and I'm good.
The rest is all out.
More sweating, crawling, and climbing.
My foot brushes a leaf.
One last climb and I'm freezing.
My feet brush through ground.
Suddenly I realize I'm outside.
Exhaustion, exuberant, endorphins.
I don't know why I did it,
But the stars are bright
And the air is frigid
And I'm out.
