Alex: I also like Stay High because it's really fun. There are bats flying around and awful
stream crawls.
Sara: What's your best cave story?
Alex: I'd have to go with the time we went to Clover Hollow and we had to haul a girl out be-
cause she couldn't climb. There was also a heel hang and a cuddle puddle at the bottom of the
entrance. It was the first time I did a changeover on an 8 because I was bored.
Joker: So Alex, do you like rock passage better or mud?
Alex: I'm quite a fan of rock passage personally. Though in mud passage you get greased up
and move pretty efficiently.
Joker: How do you feel about Pabst Blue Ribbon?
Alex: PBR is a currency. 100 PBRs could buy a car. It rebuilds Wells' truck and lets me live
forever.
Joker: What's your favorite color.
Alex: My favorite color? Ugh. I don't know... Green?
Now as we sit around the table watching the omni caver who is Awesome Bill from
Dawson Ville shotgun a Steel Reserve. We realize what high standards we cavers hold. Let us
not forget that while we rappel pits and climb squirrely bits, we always have the member who is
Alex Booker at the bottom of the rope.
