NEW LIFE MEMBERS 2010-2011
BRIAN MCCARTER
Several people have joined the ranks of VPI Cave Club Life Members this year. They really
ought to get an award or a certificate for being such upstanding and forward-thinking individu-
als and for their long years of active involvement and interest in the club, but a brief recognition
here is all they have to show for it.
The Constitution doesn't have much to say about Life Membership. This is it:
The qualifier "life" shall be applied to any full, associate, or prospective member of the
VPI Cave Club upon receipt of life membership dues. Life members shall have any
membership privileges for which they qualify, but are exempt from yearly dues.
Basically, anyone can pay $100 and be forever rid of the pesky treasurer asking for dues. But
without further ado, here are the Cave Club's newest Life Members:
Robyn Koerschner
Ray Sira
Travis Coad
Joey Fagan (he's 47.5% of the way there)
Robyn Koerschner went to the greatest effort to prove she is worthy of the title. Here is the
brief email exchange when she applied for Life Membership:
from Robyn Koerschner <wkoerschner@msn.com>
to Treasurer@vpicaveclub.org

Thank you,
