POPO CRACK DOWN AT TAG

Back in the day, a Party Policeman was a noble position meant to encourage drunken
revelery. The Party Policeman wasn't there to haul your ass to jail. He was there to escort you

really, since Boozetown never really came to fruition despite the effort (I shit you not, someone
tried to plan this years ago). So what came to be

the terrible monotone of a drum playing over and
over and recognized it for what it was: hailing Satan music.
Fortunately the Honorable Choir Director and Founder had the appropriate garb and ho-
ly relics by which to give praise to Our Dark Lord (hail Satan). Our Honorable Outfitter of the
Holy Garb, in an act that must have been inspired by our Dark Lord (hail Satan) himself, had
