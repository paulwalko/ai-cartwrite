Hello and welcome to the Cave Club!
The Cave Club has always had awesome and quirky peo-
ple and continues to uphold that tradition. This year the Trog is
proud to introduce them to you from the new to the old and to
look into how these members got into caving and what some of
their favorite things about caving are.
We are all glad to have them in our community and hope
we can continue to encourage such awesome people to join. We
like to think of the Cave Club as a tight knit community where
people can feel free to be themselves as weird as they are . It's
because of this that so many lifetime bonds have been and con-
tinue to be formed.
Here's to the people of the Cave Club!
