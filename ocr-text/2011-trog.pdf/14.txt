MATTHEW SKINNER'S INTRODUCTION TO
THE CAVE CLUB
MATTHEW SKINNER
At Tawney's
I am Matthew Skinner, a new participant this year in the VPI
Cave Club. I was always interested in the underground and ex-
ploration and being able to ever enjoy the recreational sport of
caving never really crossed my mind until I came to Virginia
Tech. It seemed like such a "club" activity, as though you had to
be part of some secret underground society, pun unintended, to
even be able to find out where caves even are. This was partially
true because most of the caves the club goes to are on private
properties with private access. However, even though it may be
a unusual and less common sport, it is by no means a secret so-
ciety. VPI has a wonderful group of people that are very enthusi-
astic in teaching the art of caving and I am happy to be part of
such an awesome club, Virginia Tech's greatest club. Go Hokies!
