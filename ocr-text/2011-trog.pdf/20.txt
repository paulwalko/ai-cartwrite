MY INTRODUCTION TO THE CAVE CLUB
BOB SIMMONDS, VPI 51
As I neared the end of high school in New Jersey and looked for the next step, universi-
ties in the Northeast like Syracuse and Rensselaer came up on the radar. “No can do,” said the
financial department. “Go south, young man, go south.” I got accepted at Georgia Tech, Clem-
son College (not yet University) and VPI (not yet &SU), the last two of which I'd never even
heard of previously.
I eliminated Georgia Tech right away; it was the furthest away and in a big city. I was
strongly inclined towards Clemson, because it turned out I actually knew someone there. I was
a shy kid and going to Clemson where I knew one person sounded a lot better than going to VPI
where I didn't know anybody. But then a conversation one morning with a girl on the school
bus convinced me that I should seriously consider going to VPI. She had spent the summer be-
tween our junior and senior years at a summer camp at the place and raved about it. But when I
asked her why she wasn't going there if she was so impressed, she replied that she didn't want
to go to a school that had 8000 guys and only 300 girls. That was VPI in the mid-60s. Heck,
only a couple years before, the then new president T. Marshall Hahn had made membership in
the Corps of Cadets optional instead of mandatory. Had being a Cadet been mandatory, VPI
would have been a non-starter for me.
Yet even with VPI's strong recommendation, I was still undecided. I concluded that VPI
should at least get a look and that campus visits there and at Clemson were needed. My dad and
I showed up at VPI and we had a very good interview with the dean of the college I was inter-
ested in. But that still wasn't enough to convince me to seriously consider going there. We wan-
dered into Burruss Hall looking for someone to talk to and were shown into an office on the
third floor overlooking the Drillfield. I don't even remember who owned the office, but he was
a very nice fellow and took about an hour to tell us about VPI. Towards the end of the visit, I
asked him what sorts of things there were to do after class hours. He started down a list begin-
ning with the highbrow German and (now extinct) Cotillion Clubs. Nah. He continued on down
the not-very-long list and nothing resonated.
Finally, he seemingly reluctantly told a story about an incident that had happened a cou-
ple months before. Apparently, a couple students had gone into a cave and gotten trapped inside
for a couple days by rising floodwaters. It turned out that the story had a happy ending when the
waters had receded and the students exited the cave. But in the meanwhile, there had been some
anxious days back at the VPI campus. My interest was piqued. I began to ask questions and I
learned that there was a club consisting of people who spent their weekends crawling around in
caves. VPI was beginning to look more interesting.
My dad and I continued on down the road to Clemson. I had another good conversation
with a college dean, but I couldn't find the fellow I knew. Nor, did it appear, that there was any
sort of a cave club on campus.
A few months later I showed up at VPI as a wet-behind-the-ears freshman and I made my
way to the Cave Club. Treasurer Ed Morgan took my trainee dues, and vice-president R. E.
Whittemore handed me a trainee card. I bought a hardhat and a carbide lamp at Western Auto,
