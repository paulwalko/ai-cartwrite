TAG FALL CAVE-IN 2010
ANDREW FAGAN
Cagle's Chasm
After a short drive from Blacksburg through Ten-
nessee, Alabama, and Georgia (also over a moun-
tain via a four-wheeler trail thanks to Alex's Book-
er's awesome gps) we made it to TAG. The event
had a festival feeling with climbing contests, live
music, bonfires, and lots of vendors with tons of
gear to look over and buy.
The Southeastern Cave Conservancy (SCC) led
organized trips and provided information and di-
rections to caves throughout their preserves. John
Bowling got directions to Cagle's Chasm and a
few of us with white nose free gear bounced the
180 foot pit. A big thanks goes out to Ray Sira for
letting us use his brand new yellow rope he had
just purchased the day before.
The lighting of the gigantic bonfire topped off the
fun that was had over the weekend. Mike New-
some helped to douse the 20' tall log structure in
gas and was cheered on as he rappelled down. A
flaming arrow set off the gas creating a brilliant
eruption of flames and fireworks.
