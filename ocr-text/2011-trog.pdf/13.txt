Freshman, BIT
Biggest caving bother:
“I hate when I get into water too deep and it gets in my
boots, it makes the whole trip go downhill”
Most memorable cave trip:
“Mexico- all of it.” [Climbed Golandrinas!]
Vehicle of choice:
“Pirate ship. Preferably the Black Pearl alongside Captain
Jack.”
Wished she had known when she joined:
“I don't think I would have wanted to know anything. It was
a nice surprise to realize how much I liked hanging out with
the people and going caving.”
