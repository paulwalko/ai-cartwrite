GRAPEVINE
For the Grotto Grapevine:
OTR 2010:
A number of cavers competed, some won their categories. Surveying (I forget), women's rope-
walker Sandy did great, Dave C. won cable ladder, others competed in frog, other things. John
Deighan travelled from the West Coast by bike to OTR!
TAG Fall Cave-In (32nd Annual)
This year, VPI had a large presence of students at the TAG Fall Cave-In on October 7-10, 2010.
Group dinner (I forgot what it was) was great and the fire was fun as always. A few adven-
turous folks bounced Dragfold Cave on Thursday night and Cagle's Chasm on Saturday.
A friend in need
On Saturday, October 23, a few cavers went up to help out former VPI member and long-term
friend of the club Cecile James move into her new home in Lynchburg, VA. Cecile is the own-
er of B&C Wunderwear, the premier producer of cave-wear. Cecile's home in Antioch, Ten-
nessee was flooded in May and much of her products and sewing supplies and equipment were
damaged or lost altogether. She decided to pack up what was left and move back to Virginia.
Movers from the club were Richard and Jean Cobb, Steve Wells, Megan Ihrefeld, Julie Booker,
and John Bowling. We hope the large Victorian house will prove a great place to continue the
business and a wonderful new home for Cecile and her son Joel.
A cold day in NC
Over the weekend of November 5-7, some VPI cavers travelled down to Highlands, NC to rap-
pel Whitesides Mountain. Whitesides is a roughly 700' drop down a granite face overlooking
Cashiers Valley. John Deighan, Kirk Digby, Andrew Fagan, Julie Booker, Alex Booker, Brian
McCarter, John Bowling and Alice Jaworski participated. Cold weather, icy roads, and rigging
issues contributed to a slow start for the Saturday rappel. Since time was short, Julie and John
stayed at the top while the others rappelled and all but Andrew and Deighan hiked back up to
the top. Overall the day was successful, if very cold. The group stayed two nights in a rental
house in nearby Scaly Mountain, NC, where they enjoyed a warm fire and delicious meals pre-
pared by Julie.
