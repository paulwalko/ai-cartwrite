ENLIGHTENING SCIENCE IN A DARK CAVE:
THE JAMES CAVE PROJECT
REBECCA STEWART
Caving has its challenges like crawling through mud or maneuvering in and out of tight
squeezes. Now try doing all that while hauling a 40-pound cement bag. This is where caving
meets science. Last semester, Joe, Jessie, Andrea, and I met up with Wil Orndorff, the Virginia
Natural Heritage Karst Program Coordinator, to help him fix a leaky weir inside James Cave.
Being a stream ecologist, I have studied streams but never before inside a cave. James Cave, a
local cave near Blacksburg, Virginia, is
a horizontal cave that Wil, in collabora-
tion with Ben Schwartz at Virginia
Tech, have been monitoring for the past
four years. Wil's enthusiasm for this
project showed as he easily hauled ce-
ment down the manmade line through
the cave. At one point I was carrying a
bag of cement on my stomach while
wiggling through a tight crawl and that
was just getting to the weir itself. Once
there, we dug a trench, mixed the ce-
ment, and set in a new v-notch weir in
place to measure stream flow. This is
one of many monitoring instruments
that are set up in James Cave.
Heather Scott, a VT student and trainee,
Cave streams are unique in the collects water from the sampling array at a
fact that they are formed from water
drip site inside James Cave
slowly dripping through the epikarst.
The epikarst is the rock between the bottom of the soil and the top of the cave. And it is these
streams that can contribute to base flow of surface streams and rivers and support the ground-
water table in karst areas.
The purpose of the James Cave project is to measure the water coming through the epikarst to
see how the chemistry varies with weather and possibly to the land-use above ground. Farther
back into the cave are tarps that collect water from soda straws and channel them into a sam-
pling array. There the water from these drips is measured for conductivity, temperature, and
flow rate (via a rain gauge). Also microinvertebrate fauna are collected along with water sam-
ples at each site. Wil explained, “One of the main goals of this project is to understand when
recharge of the underlying aquifer is taking place. When the drips are not active, the epikarst is
below capacity and the underlying water table aquifer is not being recharged.”
Five hours later we emerged from the cave with a completed cemented weir and a lot
