Beer Biscuits (Tommy Phannareth)
Good, dry biscuits for soaking up the delicious gravy that follows. Makes about two dozen.
4 cups all-purpose flour
7 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 cup shortening
1 can of beer
2 tablespoons butter, melted
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.
Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Mash the shortening into the dry ingre-
dients with a fork, or cut in with a pastry cutter, until you get a rough, cornmeal texture to the
mixture.
Add in half the beer, stir lightly, and add in the other half. Knead the dough together
very briefly, until it just comes together. Over-kneading the dough will cancel out the leavening
of the beer, and make the biscuits tough.
Roll out the dough to about half an inch thickness, and cut into rounds. Brush with melt-
ed butter, and bake for 10-15 minutes.
Sausage Gravy
A rich, meat-heavy gravy in which to smother some biscuits. Makes about eight servings.
2 pounds pork sausage
4 teaspoons fresh sage, rubbed and chopped
1 medium yellow onion, diced
6 tablespoons bacon grease
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 quarts milk
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
Crumble the sausage and brown it in a skillet over medium-high heat. When about half-
way done, add the onion and sage, and continue cooking until the sausage is completely
browned.
Pour the milk into a sauce pan, and heat over medium-low heat. Melt the bacon grease
over medium heat in a large pot, and drain the sausage drippings into the bacon grease. Add the
flour, and stir constantly until the mixture is golden brown.
Slowly whisk the warm milk into the flour and grease. When the mixture begins to
thicken, add the sausage and onions to the gravy. Add the salt and pepper, and allow to simmer
for an addition fifteen to twenty minutes.
