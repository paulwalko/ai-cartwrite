LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT
John “Johncat” Bowling
Happy when drunk
Fellow VPI Cavers,
Our strong efforts for recruitment at
the beginning of this academic year
were rewarded with a large influx
of new cavers. Despite the decline
in new members during WNS, we
managed to take out four trips on
the first weekend and many new
members are still present. I want to
thank everyone who has led a train-
ee trip this year. You've contribut-
ed to the longevity of the club. We
ought to have a number of people
coming up for membership in the
following semesters, and I'd like to
thank in advance all those who help
run vertical trips and all parts of the
tests for membership. It's you guys
who make the caving happen and
get people interested in exploring
the underground.
We enjoyed an awesome Halloween party again this
year after having an impressive turnout at the road clean
-up. I want to extend thanks to everyone who came out
to the road clean-up and those who helped make Hal-
loween a success, especially Julie Booker, who seems to
be organizing most everything this year again. Also
thanks to Lauren Waddell and Deborah Barnes, the Trog
co-editors. The club wouldn't be as much fun without
the efforts of dedicated people like you.
Cave softly,
John Bowling,
President 2010-2011
