AN INTERVIEW WITH
MIKE NEWSOME, AN "OLDER" CAVER
DEBORAH BARNES
What was late adolescence like for you? One of Mike's kids (age 6) interrupts requesting a
ham sandwich with whipped cream on top. Mike says sure... To answer your question, by the
time I was out of high school, I was tired of being a
kid. As soon as I could, I moved out. What was im-
portant and what I was into was that the things I did
had real consequences. Instead of fake ones like par-
ents impose. I was fine living on my own and having
a job that I could do well. I wasn't nervous about
the future. The Cold War and getting nuked at any
moment was a slight concern, though. It wasn't a
day-to-day feeling.
What kinds of experiences stand out for you from
that time? There was one point where I had to move
out and I didn't have a place to go. So I lived out of
the warehouse I was working and my car for a few
weeks. I used to buy used cars and mix and match
their parts. That was how I learned about auto me-
chanics. I was always interested in electronics. I
would read books about it, even in elementary
school. I used to read all the electronic books in the
Arlington library. It was pretty hard. In high school,
I took an electronics class. I was really into it. I
would stay after and blow things up when I could.
Before I could drive, we'd (Mike and friend Joe)
wait for big trash day at the IBM repair place and
we'd go dumpster diving and get all sorts of cool
electronic stuff. We busted an employee theft ring
and got special permission to dig around in the trash.
We'd then go back to Joe's house and build stuff.
That's one of the things that makes me feel good
personally. Doing stuff on your own initiative and
accomplishing things.
What important people or events impacted your identity? I always lived with other people
when I moved out. We had this really weird housemate that instituted “Naked Thursday” It was
everyone that lived there and any visitors. There wasn't need for much convincing. It was my
first exposure to nudity. I was nervous and weird at first, but now I have no issues about being
randomly naked.
