Ode to a Bronco
a Picnic story
The Bronco was a beastly old truck
Who had often escaped getting stuck.
But then Naomi did drive
The Bronco took a crash dive
The old girl had just run out of luck.
The 302 had quite some heft,
The power steering made her deft -
Blue on the bottom, white on the top
A few stout trees was required to stop
Remember, Naomi, the brake's on the left!
The gathered group just looked on sadly
As Balister stood and cackled madly
The hill, it beckoned
Then Naomi wreckoned
So much for teens driving badly.
There once was a man named Steve,
Through whose house you could barely weave.
Then Naomi swept
While poor Wells wept;
Now my first thoughts won't be to leave.
Steve he don't always think when he oughta,
He forgot she's the bastard's young daughter,
With delight she did squeal,
As she spun the old wheel,
And drove the poor Bronco to slaughter.
There once was a Bronco from Turner
Hill climbing with after burner
Where upon we observed
As Well's young student swerved
True 4-wheelin' he did learn 'er.
