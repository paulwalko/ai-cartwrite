over to the fire with a true serious and devout face (underneath glowstick glasses) and began
hailing Our Dark Lord (hail Satan) to the beat of the drum.
True followers that we were, we all began hailing Satan even throughout our persecu-
tion. Angry glares from the drummers left us unfazed. We would withstand persecution. We
would withstand it and toss all that persecuted us on to the fire that is Our Dark Lord's (hail Sa-
tan) emblem. (But not really- that's fucking crazy).
Unfortunately persecution came in the face of the system, the establishment, the man,
the popo. The diddler. Also known as the Party Police.
He came dressed in his official uniform of Burger King hat, Sunglasses, and Mardi Gras
beads. He came with authority in his eyes. Or sunglasses. “I speak for all 1083 people here
when I say you need to stop hailing Satan right now.”
This was meant with acquiescence. But with this acquiescence, every time one would
say “yes, of course, sorry”, there would be a “hail Satan” following. One of our very own gin-
gers, of which we are in proud supply, valuing that very soullessness pleasing to Our Dark Lord
(hail Satan), uttered many Hail Satans from under his dark hood throughout the “apology”. Our
Honorable Choir Director and Founder explained how we were sorry to have offended before
he said one last (but not really) hail Satan as the popo took his crowned head away from our
presence.
It was our martyr, the not-so-virgin Beth (the very-not-so-virgin Beth) that recognized
that head for what it
was. “That's the
guy who was did-
dling me in the hot
tub!”
It's one thing
to persecute us based
upon on our religion.
But diddling Beth in
the hot tub? That
just is not accepta-
ble. This is a no-no
popo. This man has
abused his position,
has offended Our
Great Dark Lord
Satan?
(hail Satan) who will
one day rise out of
the fires of TAG to
smite us all. And on
that day he may find himself diddled while we drink and play the ukulele in hell.
After all, if hell is underground, well, hell, that is where the caves are.
(hail Satan)
