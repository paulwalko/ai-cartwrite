The smell of burning nylon filled the air and in only a matter of seconds Deighan
reached the bottom of the pit.
“Where's your rack?” asked John.
“Oh I decided to arm rappel it.” The group nodded in awe.
After minimal resting Alex and Brian headed back up the rope. Deighan, John, and
Courtney watched for a little over an hour as the two ascended into the light. Once safely at the
top Alex radioed the last three, *click* “Off rope.”
While Deighan, John, and Courtney prepared to climb, some peculiar sounds came from
the radio.
*click* “Ah! *buzz* No! Ack!”
“Is everything okay up there?”' John
asked hesitantly.
"NO! Cartels! Stay down!” Brian
shouted.
The three stuck at the bottom
looked worriedly at each other wait-
ing for more detailed news. Mean-
while, the five up top fought with the
cartel members, fearing for their
lives.
“Los Gringos!!” shouted one of the
cartels.
"No drugas! No drugas!” screamed
Brian.
Deborah hit one over the head
with her rack while Alex tried to tie
another one down. Unfortunately,
the third cartel member reached the
rope and used the machete around his
waist to cleanly cut the rope down.
At the bottom of the pit, Deighan,
John, and Courtney ran out of rock
fall to avoid the falling 1200 foot
rope.
Brian is scared. Very Scared
