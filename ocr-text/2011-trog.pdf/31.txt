HAWK RESCUE
JULIE BOOKER
Thanks to the caving talents of Mr. John
Lillestolen and Mr. Wil Orndorff, and the photog-
raphy talents of Mr. Alex Booker and myself, the
hawk, believed to be a Broad-winged variety was
rescued from the entrance of Clover Hollow early
in the afternoon.
The animal was a bit tricky to capture evad-
ing Wil and John then finding its way to scoop
some virgin passage. Mr. Orndorff deemed himself
too large to fit though without some cave recon-
struction. Mr. Lillestolen however determined he
couldn't let a bird out scoop him so he squeezed
himself down the small passage and captured the
hawk with a blanket and handed it off to Mr.
Orndorff who then got the hawk into a cat carrier.
Mr. Orndorff toted the hawk out of the cave. When
we
were out we drove the animal down away from the cave to a clearing and set it free. The bird
flew off with little thanks to us for getting it out of that confounding hole. Maybe it wasn't
quite finished with that
turkey
din-
ner.
