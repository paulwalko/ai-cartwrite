found is that one way of making your identity work with society is to act out a pseudo identity
you make out that will work with expectations. That's what most people do as a tactical thing.
That's why identities seem to change. People change the role they are playing. People interact
with your behavior, not your identity. I modify mine when I realize that acting one way is a
mistake. That doesn't change my
identity. If you only reflect what's
going on around you, you don't have
one. On the inside, I don't think that
I've changed at all. However, I've
come more to terms with just because
you feel this, doesn't mean that you
have to do that. I have no interest
now in b.s. You only owe people a
truthful answer if they ask a truthful
question. That confuses and irritates
people. It is very prevalent in the ado-
lescent types. Fitting in isn't neces-
sary a bad thing, but it is when it be-
comes way more important than their
integrity.
What do you think about others
your age? It annoys me that they're
so stupid. People in general are still into categorizing and pidgin holing. The average person my
age... I wish more of them would think for themselves. The fact that reality television is suc-
cessful, to me, is a very bad sign. But that applies to all ages, especially the voting age people.
The people who could stop political nonsense have been trained not to care. It's pretty clever,
actually. The reason people think they have a changing identity is that, as kids, their parents
suppress their true identities. By taking risks and making mistakes and choices. They treat you
like a pet and not a person. Your
parent's plan is your plan. They con-
trol every aspect of your life. In ado-
lescence, how bad that effect is can
completely eliminate your awareness
that you even have an identity. I was
a pretty brainwashed kid.
Side note: Mike's child did end up
eating the sandwich. All of it.
