Joe and others above. But he was STUCK! One of the Blacksburg fellows (a pretty good lot)
was having a fantabulous time ‘carving the Michelangelo' on the ledges near the fellows chest
with an electric hammer chisel. Now anyone who has ever been on a cave dig knows the futility
of asking the guy at the sharp end to trade places. Shy any emergency or perhaps greater art
skill, we certainly did not want to spoil his fun. Oh, the phrase – usually in the context of,
“Jimmy, you diggin' or carving the Michelangelo up there?”
He does in fact look
amused... almost as
amused as when he was
in China...
| A few more tries and with a
fair bit of pulling and writh-
ing on the fellow's part, he
was lifted out of the crack
and into a stretcher as he
thanked us profusely.
In the end all the rescue
boys roared off to the next
| big call, the helicopter flew
off with the search light pan-
ning the mountains, and the
cavers stood around sipping
brewski and comparing ta-
les.
