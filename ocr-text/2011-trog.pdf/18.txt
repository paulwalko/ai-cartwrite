How has having kids changed you from when you were in late adolescence?
I take fewer drugs, but that's just a coincidence. Kids give me a predefined, never-ending, high
payoff project to work on. Even if I have nothing else, I have that. Raising my kids. I am not
more responsible by societal standards. Although, I was never outstandingly irresponsible when
I was younger. Most parent types would consider me to be irresponsible, but I disagree. I'm just
more willing to let my kids experience things and make mistakes than most people would.
Do you feel that your life is more fulfilling now than when you were in late adolescence?
“Fulfilling? Is that something they do to you at the dentist?” It's a complicated thing. What
makes me feel good is doing things, making things happen, and building things. Or going into
party mode and going completely crazy. Interviewer rephrases the word fulfilling as
"satisfying” I would say, it's about the same. I'm not thrilled with the balance of successes ver-
sus failures right now, but I'm trying. I haven't given up. I don't dwell on it. There's no use
wasting time on being miserable. There's always the possibility that things will get better and
you will feel better. That's why you shouldn't kill yourself.
Are you more self-conscious of your body now or when you were younger? I'm never real-
ly worried about that. I have a mental image of myself as being strong and healthy. I expect to
be, and I am. My appearance isn't
real because in my universe, I can't
see myself. My appearance to others
is abstract. Back when I was 20, I
was so nerdy that I didn't have any
chances to interact with girls, so
what I looked like didn't matter. I
never got to the point when it did.
When I get old, I have plans to build
a racing wheelchair.
Have you experienced a “mid-life”
crisis? I don't think I've reached
mid-life yet. I've experienced life
crises, but I don't think they were
strictly related to age. Sometimes
shit happens, and you have to deal
with it. So, no.
What do you think about your
identity? I think that the concept
that you have a different identity at
different stages of life is b.s. Your
only continuity is your identity. It
doesn't change drastically. What
changes is the way identity interacts
with the rest of the world. What I've
