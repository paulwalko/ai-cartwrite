TAG 2010
Tie dye parade!
Climbing the tower (until
you're told to get down or are
Mike)!
Yay! Free glowsticks!
Dance party! There may not
have been a dance floor this
year but there is always the VPI
campsite.
Schuchardt being Schuchardt
Ukuleles, the perfect party in-
strument.
Pissing people off. Hey, it's
what Kirk did one year playing
his guitar (some people don't
like the word “twat” I guess).
Only he didn't piss off the
“police” and all 1000 people at
TAG?
Diddling.
