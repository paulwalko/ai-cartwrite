LETTER FROM THE EDITOR
Hey Cavers!
So yet again we have another quite substantial sized Trog. Awesome. It's cool to see that this
year's has turned out quite differently from last year's. This year we have different sections
such as a section for interviews with members of the cave club. We also have a puzzle section
thanks to John George. I'm a little sad to see that we don't have the Caver Horror Story section
this year but I'm still glad to see all the variety we've got. I'm hoping that in upcoming years
people will continue to submit a variety of articles and will be able to look at these old Trogs as
a guide when they are having trouble coming up with ideas. Unfortunately I'll probably be in
grad school come fall semester but I'm glad to leave the Trog in capable hands. Deborah has
done a great job encouraging people to submit articles and helping them with ideas and I'm
glad to have her as my co-editor. I'm hoping the cave club can continue to keep producing awe-
some Trogs.
Thanks for all your work!
Lauren Waddell and Deborah Barnes
