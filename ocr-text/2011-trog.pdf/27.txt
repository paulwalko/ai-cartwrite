SURVEY TRIP TO MILL CREEK CAVE

“...and I looked down and saw a pebble, similar in shape to the pebble next to it. This made me
think...”
On Saturday, January 31st, 2011, I went on a survey trip with Mike Futrell and Jon Lillesto-
len to Mill Creek Cove. We first met with a private landowner in the cove, Greg, who was gra-
cious enough to give us a tour of his property and help us search for new caves. He led us up a
hill near his house and almost immediately we found a cave. It looked to have about a 10 foot
entrance pit that was easily climbable. Greg then piled us into his Gator and drove us around the
property pointing out springs and potential caves. After trudging through mud, he took us to the
top of a hill where we found another cave he had been talking about. This cave likely had at
least a 100 foot entrance pit and we suspect it may connect to a spring at the bottom of the hill
(about a 500 foot elevation change). Next, we traveled to another location where a hunter had
reported seeing steam coming from the ground. After about an hour of searching Mike was able
to find an approximately 20 foot sinkhole. Our initial inspection showed no entrances but the
bottom of the sinkhole was obstructed by leaves and debris.
Greg was again nice enough to drop us off at Mill Creek Cave, the target of our survey trip.
Since the cave is on TNC (The Nature Conservancy) land, Jon had to go through extra efforts to
gain permission for us to survey the cave. We were truly lucky to even gain access at all. The
entrance to the cave was a narrow slit about 10 feet above a spring coming out of the side of the
mountain. We immediately noticed about a dozen bats at the entrance to the cave. Although
there were no obvious signs of white nose syndrome on the bats, the behavior they were exhib-
iting was consistent of a white nose infection. After squeezing our way through the entrance we
happened upon the stream that fed the spring observed outside the cave. As we surveyed up-
stream the depth of the creek varied between a few inches to a chilling waist deep. Along the
way there were several beautiful formations consisting of flowstone, bacon, and some soda
straws. We also counted three stream side salamanders in the cave as well as a frog (possibly a
leopard frog). Eventually we came to a room that had been sumped on a previous survey trip.
Due to the low water level we were able to pass this room and continue surveying. We came
upon passage filled with beautiful ceiling formations and eventually came to another sump.
This one proved impassible but there were some potential leads that could be explored in the
future. On the wall we noticed scratch marks from the Blacksburg Boy Scout Troop #2 dated
1921, Corps of Cadets F Company dated 1943, and carbide markings from a NSS caver we
could not clearly identify.
In about 2 hours we had surveyed Mill Creek Cave to a length of 1,323 feet. On the way
back we decided to explore another cave that Greg had pointed out to us, which we named Red
Hawk Cave. After a brutal 300 foot hike/climb to the top we found that this promising lead to
be nothing more than a 15 foot cave that led absolutely nowhere. Despite this disappointment,
we had an excellent trip. Mill Creek Cave had been surveyed and we had discovered two new
caves and a promising lead.
