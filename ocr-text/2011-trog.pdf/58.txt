The Untested Chris Garguilo Ice Cream (Guinness and Chocolate)
(Deborah Barnes)
makes about one quart
7 ounces milk chocolate, finely chopped
1 cup whole milk
1/2 cup sugar
pinch of salt
4 large egg yolks
1 cup heavy cream
3/4 cup Guinness Stout
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Put the chocolate pieces in a large bowl and set a mesh strainer over the top.
Warm the milk, sugar, and salt in a medium saucepan. In a separate medium bowl, whisk to-
gether the egg yolks. Slowly pour the warm mixture into the egg yolks, whisking constantly,
then scrape the warmed egg yolks back into the saucepan.
Stir the mixture constantly over medium heat with a heatproof spatula, scraping the bottom as
you stir, until the mixture thickens and coats the spatula. Pour the custard through the strainer
over the milk chocolate, then stir until the chocolate is melted. Once the mixture is smooth,
whisk in the cream, then the Guinness and vanilla. Stir until cool over an ice bath.
Chill the mixture thoroughly in the refrigerator, then freeze it in your ice cream maker accord-
ing to the manufacturer's instructions.
