MEXICO: THE REAL STORY
COURTNEY TROUST
It was a bright and sunny day
of approximately 85 degrees when
the brave American travelers awoke
to the sound of flying swallows.
Camping next to a 1200 foot pit is
far from recommended, as Samantha
will attest to after barely surviving
the morning. Phil woke up to the
sound of screaming as half of his
tent slipped down the side of Sótano
de las Golondrinas with Sam barely
holding on to the edge.
“I told you not to roll in your
sleep damnit!” Phil roared at his girl-
friend, angry about being woken up.
Fortunately for Samantha the
screaming woke up the others who
rushed to the tent to rescue her from
certain death. Brian approached the
tent first and picked up the entire
tent with his brute strength, carrying
both Phil and Sam away from the
edge of the pit. Thankful to be alive,
Sam got out of the tent still shaking.
John Deighan: Even fire runs away in fear.
“It's time to make food,
woman!” Phil growled hungrily.
Samantha started on breakfast while Phil complained, Deborah relaxed, and the others
prepared for Golondrinas. After a delicious meal the five wishing to brave the endless pit ap-
proached the edge with caution. Alex rappelled down first, preparing a belay before the others
ventured down. After Brian, John, and Courtney joined Alex at the bottom, the group explored
the floor of bird shit.
*click* "Deighan is coming down too.” Deborah informed the group over the radio.
Alex saw the beam of light from a helmet far above them. “El Deigo!"
