WAYS TO RESPECT BATS
by Marvin Fuqua
Â· Contrary to popular belief bats do not attack people. There
are many rumors about bat attacks which permeate among amateur
cavers, but these simply are unfounded. Bats, with the exception
of the South and Central Americas' vampire bat, do not normally
attack creatures larger than themselves. Horror Stories
concerning bats are usually generated because bats fly close to
humans in caves. These fly-bys are not attacks. Bats, like men,
have certain paths that they follow daily and when we go through
the caves, we sometimes obstruct their normal flight pattern and
they have to take the time to maneuver around us. If a bat
should become rabid and thus attack a caver, an extremely rare
occurence, the bat should be captured and sent with the bitten
caver to the hospital as rabies can be lethal.
Many caves have bats and thus we should learn how to
peacefully coexist. Bats adjust to the presence of other animals
and as a result they are not particularly threatened by men in
their homes. This means that they will not bother you unless you
bother them.
Bats are nocturnal creatures which forage for food at night,
thus nocturnal cave trips would bring about greater contact with
active bats. A few species of bats migrate during winter and
summer seasons, while others hibernate during the winter. Many
of the bats in this area hibernate, thus winter trips should
be few in number in order to avoid upsetting the ecology of the
cave. Bats have been recorded to have life spans as high as
thirty years and we should do all we can to ensure the longevity
of our insect eating friends,
Bats have excellent navigating abilities. They emit
sonar-like signals of short duration at tremendous speed, so if a
bat flies towards you, don't panic. He will detect you and move
out of your way. In addition to excellent navigational ability,
they have remarkable homing instincts. One bat was reported to
have returned home from a distance of 180 miles. A few small
brown bats have returned home in one night -- a distance of
slightly over 60 miles.
Bats have existed in caves for thousands of years without
need of our assistance so NEVER HANDLE BATS. They have adapted
to their environment, and if you interfere with the balance of
nature in the bats' world, you may cause catastrophic ecological
damage.
Resting bats sometimes appear to be wet on the outside, and
some cavers may think that drying off the bat or stroking off the
water may help it. This is absolutely false, Bats secrete an
oily substance which makes their fur waterproof. If they should
be touched, this oil barrier will be disrupted. The bat will
become wet, and thus more susceptible to the cold. Besides,
resting bats should never be disturbed.
