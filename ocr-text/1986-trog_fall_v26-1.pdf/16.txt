caves of the region from about mid-September through early May.
There will be exceptions to the generalities of this key.
1.
Bats in clusters? (cluster = body contact in groups of 5 or
more individuals........... Yes, go to 2.......... No, go to 4
2. Bats are clustered in area greater than one foot in diameter
(with as many as 200 bats per square foot).
........... Yes, go to 3.......... No, go to 2'
2'. Bats are clustered in area less than one foot in diameter
(with fewer than 100 bats per square foot).
......Little Brown Bat
3.
3
Ears are about one inch in length (may be curled down at side

NOT IN THE KEY are two species rarely encountered and
usually solitary: Myotis keenii and Myotis leibii. M. leibii
looks like a tiny little brown bat with a very dark face; it is
about the size of a pip. Keen's bat also looks like a little
brown, about the same size, with longer ears (about 3 mm longer).
Two bats that may be found in the Virginia Region of the NSS but
not in the key or on the list are Plecotus rafinesquii and Myotis
austroriparius.
Two species of bats are found in caves in the summer:
big-eared bats (maternity colonies) and gray bats (maternity and
bachelor colonies). Sometimes pips can also be found in caves at
this time of year.
Myotis lucifugus (Little brown bat): Forearm 34-41 mm (avg.
38 mm), ear 14-16 mm, foot 10-11 mm, weight 6-13 g. Few
scattered long hairs on foot extending to tip of claws or beyond.
Brown glossy fur. Yellowish belly contrasts with back fur.
Often covered with water drops. Small, fairly loose clusters;
hang along cracks and end up in belly-to-back overlapping
relationship. Very difficult to distinguish from M. sodalis.
Ears and face usually darker than sodalis. Calcar not keeled.
