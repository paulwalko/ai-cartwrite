After reaching the halfway mark of the cave (where the
crushed calcite crawl begins), we decided not to continue along
the main passage and began to poke around in some of the many
side passages. While doing this, Dave Strope found two hundred
yards of virgin chimney passage (undisturbed manganese dioxide
deposits on the dirt walls indicated that the passage was
virgin). After an hour and a half of sticking our heads into
whatever looked like it might go somewhere, we started out.
Instead of going out through the cave entrance, we went out
through the underground quarry. The quarry has a ceiling about
eighty feet in height and is supported by fifty-foot-in-diameter
pillars. We got out of the cave at 9:30 and got back to
Blacksburg, safe and almost sound, at 12:00 (Al, who was at the
wheel, dozed off twice).
EWING SALTPETER CAVE

Thanksgiving weekend, 1965, gave me the opportunity to do
some work with the Virginia Cave Survey in Lee County, Virginia.
Ed Bauer and myself left Wednesday after classes in one very
tightly packed Volkswagen for Pennington Gap, GHQ for that
particular weekend. I caved with Ed on Thursday and Friday, but
on Saturday we went our separate ways. I heard that he was going
to cold and wet Surgener's Cave, but I had already had enough
cold and wet caving for that weekend (Indian Cave) so I went to
nice, warm, and dry Ewing Saltpeter.
To describe Ewing Saltpeter Cave in one or two words would
be impossible, but three will suffice. It is basically just ONE
HUGE ROOM. On visiting the cave, one can't help but get the
impression that the hill in which the cave is located is just one
big bubble. With a cave that big, and a hill that small, what
else could it be?
. The group entered the cave at about 10 A.M. The short
entrance passage leads down into a room about 50' in diameter and
with a ceiling height of about 10. From this entrance room, a
walking passage leads straight ahead for about 100'. This
passage enters the big room near the top, and a rope is needed
for the descent to the floor. From the entrance room, another
passage leads off to the left. This duck-walk passage goes for
about 100', coming out at the top of a wooden ladder. The ladder
leads down to a small room, from which there are at least two
passages leading to the large room. One passage enters the big
room at the floor level under the first passage (the one that
requires the rope) and the other one enters the big room along
the left side at the floor level.
