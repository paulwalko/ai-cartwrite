The Editor's Column
Another Trog has been pretty well typed into the computer,
and once again, the response of the club to my pleas for articles
has exceeded my expectations. Many thanks to all the
contributors. Now all that's left to do is for me to think of
some intelligent way to fill the editor's page.
I feel that there is still some negative response to the
requirement of prospective members that they write an article for
the Trog as part of the requirements to join the VPI Cave Club as
full members. One of the O.F.'s even raised the question of
whether we were trying to turn the club into a literary
organization. Hardly. But I do feel that everyone has something
to say. Maybe I shouldn't have specified "article", but should
have said something like "trip report" instead. Somehow that
sounds less formidable. Back in the dawn of history, when
trainees were trainees, the trip report was the thing to do
although one had the option of writing an article if one so
desired. (It was amazing what some people could disguise as a
trip report.) Anyway, I've included a couple of trainee trip
reports from just a few years ago in this TroÃ« as examples. As
you can see, they are not that big a deal, particularly the
second one.
As this Trog gets wrapped up, I think its time to suggest
that someone out there might start thinking in terms of taking
over as the editor. The standard editor burn-out period seems to
be about three issues which gives me one more after this one.
More importantly, however, is that I am not an active enough
caver to do the publication justice. The Trog deserves better
and the VPI Cave Club deserves better,
