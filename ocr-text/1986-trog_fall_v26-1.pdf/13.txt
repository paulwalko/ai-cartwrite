Car Cramming
Just about everyone knows that cavers have an obsession with
trying to see how small a space they can fit through. Folding
chairs, coat hangers and porch railings are popular cave club
party favors. There are even a few individuals around that can
fit through a coat hanger sideways. One Friday night as we
planned for a routine trip to James cave in Radford, it became
apparent that the size of the party was becoming larger than was
hoped for, considering that we all had to fit in one car. This
is especially significant since the car was my metallic blue '66
Mustang, which has very limited interior space to begin with.
The expedition consisted of Craig Roberts, Beth Wichterman, Joan
Johnson, Reggie Reid, Drew Porter, Don Oswald, and myself.
When we met the next morning, our group of seven proceeded
to start loading ourselves and all our gear into the car. We
sprung the trunk lid when we slammed it shut after cramming it to
nearly 50% over capacity. We still had a very large duffle bag
and all seven people to fit into the Mustang. After three people
got into the back seat we loaded the duffle bag in. Then we
wedged Beth into the back seat across their laps. Next, the
remaining three people squeezed into the two front bucket seats
and we were ready to go. Of course, the gear shift had to be
between the seats to make the seating problem even more
difficult. The weight on the little Ford was so great that I had
to add air to my air shocks to keep the rear end from dragging.
At last we were on our way. We had to repeat packing and
unpacking the car five times: after going to the sign out, at
Krogers, upon leaving the cave, back at the sign in sheet, and
finally at Derring parking lot outside of Pamplin hall, where the
party split up until we all met again at the next Friday night
meeting. On this trip we probably got more exercise getting in
and out of the car than we did caving. Maybe sometime this year
we can try cramming ten people into someone's Chevette.
