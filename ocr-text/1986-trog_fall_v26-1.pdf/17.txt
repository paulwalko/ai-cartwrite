Myotis sodalis (Indiana bat): ENDANGERED SPECIES. Closely
resembles Myotis lucifugus. Fur may be more grayish than
lucifugus; never glossy or yellowish. Forearm 34-41 mm (avg.
38 mm), ear 14-15 mm, weight 5-11 ô, 9 mm foot, Hairs on foot
short and inconspicuous. Hibernates 37-430F Singletons
sometime look like long johns hanging on a line. No droplets of
moisture condense on fur. Found in high, but not saturated,
humidity (66-95%; av. 87%). Typically found in large caves.
Hibernates as large carpet on flat surfaces with only noses,
ears, and wrists visible. Keeled calcar Light belly fur.
Myotis keenii (Keen's myotis): 34-38 mm forearm (av.37),
weight 5-10 gm, foot 10 mm. Ear 17-19 mm and extending 3. or more
mm beyond the nose when laid forward (less than 3 mm for
lucifugus), tragus longer and more pointed than lucifugus,
Cooler hibernating sites than lucifugus. Near entrances but with
high humidity. Never abundant in any one area. Easily missed;
rarely seen. Usually hang's singly or tucked away in crevices or
holes. Brown fur, not glossy Light belly fur. Sometimes
covered with water droplets.
Myotis leibii (Leib's myotis): smallest Myotis (about the size
of a pipestrelle). 28-36 mm forearm(av. 32), ear 14-15 mm, tiny
7-8 mm foot. weight 4-6 gm, keeled calcar. Hangs solitary,
tucked away in cracks. Dorsal fur glossy, usually brown, but
more golden than lucifugus. Ears, wings, lips black. Prefers
cooler hibernating sites than lucifugus but more tolerant to low
humidity than keenii. Hibernates near entrances. Similar to E.
fuscus in hibernating sites.
Myotis griscescens (Gray bat): ENDANGERED SPECIES. 40-46 mm
forearm, large 12 mm foot, weight 7-10 gm, ear 16 mm calcar not
keeled. Dull grayish-brown dorsal fur is uniformly same color
from base to tip of hairs. Ventral surface lighter. Wing
membrane attached at ankle (vs. toe attachment for other spp.
concerned). Hibernates 45-500F in deep, vertical caves. Large
aggregates like sodalis, but tightness of clusters due to
forearms angled out (interwoven arms). Clusters may be several
tiers in thickness.
Pipistrellus subflavus (Pip): 31-35 mm forearm, foot 9-11 mm ear
13--15 ma weight 4-7 gm. Small body, hangs like a fuzzy ball.
Calcar not keeled. Only bat (besides M. leibii) with forearm
that small. Often covered with water drops. Prefers 99%
humidity Yellowish dorsal fur contrasting very little with
ventral fur Tricolored fur: base of hairs is dark, middle band
is lighter, tip is dark. Anterior third of interfemoral membrane
furred. Hibernates singly, prefers warmer parts of cave in
protected side passages (52-55°F).
