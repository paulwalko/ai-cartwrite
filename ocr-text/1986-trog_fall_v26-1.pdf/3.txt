The PREZ's Columns
This has been a good year for the club. I'd like to thank
everyone from VPI who helped with the OTR site, Glen Davis and
Jerry Redder in particular.
This fall we increased our membership, or rather the number
of dues-paying members has increased. We have many prospective
members thanks to everyone who helped take trainee trips this
fall. Remember, trainees make caving interesting. Take one
along on your next trip,
Finally, I'd like to remind everyone to be careful down
there. The past few months have proven that you can't be too
cautious.
