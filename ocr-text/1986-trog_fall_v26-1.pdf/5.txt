THE GROTTO GRAPEVINE
Many things have been happening since last Spring. To start
with OTR, this year was the first at the new site in Dailey, WY.
There were 1500+ people in attendance, once again a record
setting number. VPI won a number of prizes in Speleolympics,
including Jenny Ford's first place in the women's obstacle
course. York Grotto won big, though, so we all need to start
working out for next year to show those people who the best
cavers are. Of course, on the party front we all know who's the
best. The more wine party took place again this year, but with a
new twist; party in the creek! As the party in the creek was
breaking up, a small contingent continued the more wine party as
party in the hot tub! Afterwards, Ko Takamizawa was seen passed
out naked next to the hot tub. Did anybody get any pictures?
On the second of August, Steve Conner and Ann Marie finally
tied the knot, A bunch of B-burg cavers attended and managed to
behave themselves until the newlyweds were about to drive off.
Then Redder, Hugh, and Dave climbed in the back of the car; they
didn't get very far. Later there was a party at the Peterson's
house. Sandy's frozen margaritas had people dancing in the
rafters.
On November 22nd, Kay Jacobsen married Neil Johnson. We
know she must have had some reservations about it though, because
she was seen stinking drunk in the Hokie House just a week before
the wedding. Becky Himmelmann caught the bouquet; does this mean
she might marry Jeff sometime soon? After the wedding, Chip and
Jenny Clark took everyone for a behind-the-scenes tour of the
Smithsonian Natural History Museum. A good time was had by all.
Since this is a caving club, I suppose some mention should
be made of caving-related happenings. We've had three rescues
and near rescues since August. Ko Takamizawa got his foot caught
under a rock in Stompbottom in August. He was freed without
incident, but it is interesting to note that only our own VPI
cayers were all the way back in the cave, where Ko was. In
September, VPI was called out for a search in McClung's Cave in
West Virginia. The lost caver was found, unhurt, after a day-
long search. Most recently, VPI was called out for a search in
our favorite New River Cave to find a lost nerd-caver. The guy
was out of the cave by the time the first people got there.
Keith Goggin has finished surveying Spring Creek Pit. It
has 5 waterfall drops and is 200+ feet deep. Stompbottom still
goes. The Zo's are still working on Newberry's. They're also
pleading for babysitters who can stay from the beginning of a
cave trip until the end, whenever the end may be. Lawrence Britt
is still in the Navy, and he has finally finished the Starnes
map. Ed Fortney is still taking the Church of God caving.
