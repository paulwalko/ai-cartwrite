Two Trainee Trip Reports From the Sixties:
LOWMOOR CAVE
by Glen Davis
Personnel: Al Armstrong, Dave Strope, Carole Noble, Tom Roehr,
Glen Davis
To get to Lowmoor Cave, take U.S. Route 460 towards Roanoke,
then take U.S. Route 220 north to Clifton Forge. From Clifton
Forge, take Interstate 64 west for four miles until you come to
State Route 616. Turn left off of Route 616 into Lowmoor and
then turn right on the first paved road. Drive on until you pass
the town and then look for an old bridge on the right-hand side
of the road. The cave entrance is about four hundred yards up
and around the side of the hill. The cave can also be entered
through the quarry either by a one hundred foot vertical drop or
by an old truck ramp. I suggest looking for the cave entrance as
it is very easy to keep walking in circles when inside the
quarry.
We left Blacksburg at 10:30 on Saturday, March 5th (1966,
Ed.), ate lunch in Clifton Forge, and entered the cave at 1:30.
When we first entered the cave it appeared to be a very wet cave.
It turned out that the puddles and profuse dripping were unique
to the entrance chamber. The rest of the cave was very dry, thus
making the temperature seem much higher than it really was.
The half of cave that we saw was entirely walking passage.
The solutional form of these passages created a very interesting
rock formation in which many interesting and beautiful
photographs could be taken with different colored lights. The
larger of these passages are actually long rooms, but this is
not easily seen because of the formations which greatly limit
one's ability to look straight down the room. This section of
the cave, the upper section, is connected to the lower section by
a vast maze chamber.
The lower section of the cave is the most beautiful because
of the many calcite formations. Many of thses high grade calcite
formations are broken and crushed, and literally cover the floor.
In the lower section of the cave, I am told, there is an
extensive crawling passage that is completely covered with
crushed calcite. This passage could be very grueling and painful
if a person was not wearing heavy pants and shirt, as the broken
calcite is very sharp and cannot be evaded.
