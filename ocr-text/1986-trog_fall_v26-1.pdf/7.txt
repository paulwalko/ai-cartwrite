Halloween party was hosted by Rob Hills and Mike Fiore.
Glen Davis donated food and punch. Thanks guys! Mary, Keith
Smith's girlfriend, won best costume for her "Doodle Bird.
Other costumes were: The Color Purple, The Doors, Swiss Army
Knife, Vampires, Hixon, Barmaid, Kentucky Girl, Cousin It's, and
many others. A good time was had by all, but many people don't
remember it!
And now for a few last odds and ends. Maureen Handler is
working in Massachussetts. Mike Futrell is back from Kentucky
but still isn't a student, Glen Davis and Don Anderson have been
doing alot of backpacking lately; are they trying to get into the
Outing Club? Plans are being made for another Mexico trip this
Christmas. Mike Fiore wants to renounce his New Jersey
citizenship. Dave Cinsavich finally graduated from a certain
class, so Jerry Redder had a graduation party for him (bring a
substance and abuse it!). Viola Ritchie (alias Elvira) is
desperately trying to finish her thesis this quarter. Linda
Oxenreider will be graduating at the end of this quarter, but
will she ever find a job?
For the answer to this and other questions, and for a good
dose of the latest dirt, be sure to read Grotto Grapevine in the
next issue of the Tech Trog, coming to newsstands in your area.
