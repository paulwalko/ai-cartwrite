Spring Hollow Revisited
by Mike Futrell
On September 27, myself and Ko Takamizawa, a grad student at
Va. Tech, drove out to Skydusky Hollow, Bland Co. Va. I was
hoping to do a climb at the end of cave rat passage that I had
noted in late 1983. This area is beneath the entrance portion of
Bane's Spring Cave, and a connection has long been sought after.
Ko is a willing and capable caver who has belayed for me on
previous occasions. I was confident in his abilities to endure
what may be a long trip.
After securing permission from the owner, myself, Ko and the
'bitch' (my 25-30 lb. gear bag) proceeded into Spring Hollow
Cave. A few short climbs later we rigged a rope on the 357
nuisance drop due to our dislike for the traditional cable ladder
approach. A very fast hour and a half later we found ourselves
at Wilbur Done. There before us solemnly hung the bluewater left
exactly three years ago when Frank Gibson, Eric Anderson, and
myself did the 43' bolt climb. After tugging on the rope (not to
hard for fear of pulling it down), I ascended followed by Ko. He
looked at the rig point and just said "...wow." We briefly
rechecked the passage going off at this point but found little of
ficance aside from a deep fissure which I had difficulty
getting back up,
Due to the curved and fissured nature of the lip at the top
of the bolt climb, where it is impossible to stand without being
on rope, one can look up and over to see a hole l' X 2' in the
very top of the dome-pit about 25' away. There is very little
maneuvering space here and anything dropped will be lost down a
tight fissure. Fully anticipating an aid climb, I set to
organizing my gear rack while Ko worked on setting up a belay.
All too soon our procrastination techniques were used up and it
was time. In starting the climb, I noticed an intermitent ledge
flake leading up the wall. Perhaps I could lead this route!
About 15' later I found my first pro, a sling looped over a
pinnacle. It looked bomb proof and gave me the courage to
proceed with shear blackness below. Nearing the top, I found a
manky looking jug handle just before the crux move into the lead.
I clipped into this with another sling but it didn't take the
fear of falling away as it should have. I made the last move by
putting my arms up in the muddy lead and feet swinging pulled
myself up while trying to keep all the gear at my side from
getting caught. A nice rush followed. Wow, I had led the climb
and it wasn't as difficult as it had looked. The dome was
plumbed at 60' from this point. I found myself in a small alcove
with a two foot wide muddy muddy fissure leading up and off the
end. I slined up the fissure and found another pit!
