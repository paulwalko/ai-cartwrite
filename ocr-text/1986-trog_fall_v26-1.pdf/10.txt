After calling the news back to Ko, I down-climbed the route
leaving my pro in place. We reorganized the gear and discussed
our options. We would have to pull the Bluewater off the bolt
climb to avoid using the dynamic climbing rope on the new pit.
I re-led the pitch with the Bluewater trailing. After reaching
the alcove, I hauled the remainder of the gear and packs on the
Bluewater and belayed Ko as he seconded the climb. We then each
set a bolt over the lip of the new pit. Ko rigged and descended
cleaning a lot of loose rock along the way. I followed. We
found it to be 35', dead bottomed, filled with sandstone cobble
and breakdown. Once again Spring Hollow gives a little bit to
those who work really hard. We sat at the bottom of Ko's Pit,
ate supper and discussed the cave. With mission accoraplished, we
still had four roped pitches between us and the entrance, two up
and two down, not to mention the misery of the cave in general.
Fortunately we were prepared cavers and had beer waiting in the
car. With this in mind we, began the long haul out. Special
thanks goes to Ko, whose experience and caving drive made another
trip a success.
