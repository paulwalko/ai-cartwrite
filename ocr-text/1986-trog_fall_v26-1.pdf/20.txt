continuity
Revolving internally
Winding down
The mechanical spiral
Spins us around
Like the DNA pattern
With the life it contains
From inspired creations
To decaying remains
The motion
The movement
The pressure
And heat
The molecules moving
The rhythm complete
Each atom's existence
All energy and thought
Are from physics and forces
Eternally caught
In waves like the ocean
Only rolling in air
No beginning
No ending
Always going
Nowhere
Janelle Slivinske
Madam President
There once was a girl named Joan
Who got off on banging the bone
That wasn't too swell
The club went to hell
Now everyone's caving alone.
