Light also affects bats. "Bright light or white light of
any type may be lethal in many cases for most bats." (Zoologist
Jack A. Cranford) As mentioned earlier, bats associate light
with dusk and dawn, and they have internal clocks which are set
by these signals. The clock tells them when to wake up to leave
the cave and feed. The presence of artificial light can cause
the bat's clock to be reset. Once reset, the bat will miss its
proper feeding window, and many local species could die if they
go two or more days without feeding. They cannot adapt to
another type of insect food, thus they would starve if they
should miss their normal prey. According to Dr. Cranford, the
best lighting to use would be low intensity red light. It should
be noted that carbide lamps put out a low intensity beam and they
are further in the red spectrum than are electrical lights.
Regardless of your lighting system you should never shine light
directly on bats, especially while they are resting. Moreover,
PHOTOGRAPHS OF BATS SHOULD NEVER BE TAKEN FOR ANY REASON. There
is NO exception. The presence of man can cause additional
problems as well. Nerdy cavers leave spent carbide, food, and
other garbage in caves which could also upset the cave's ecology.
Remember the rule of thumb, "Leave nothing but footprints." A
result of leaving behind food and other garbage is that it could
attract rats and other potential bat predators into the cave, in
addition to ruining the cave for others. In addition we should
not break off or remove anything as bats can become confused if
the cave's topology has been altered.
The only times a bat should be touched are first, if there
is a good chance that you could accidentally knock him down, and
second, if it has already been knocked down. The dangers of
being on the ground are three-fold. First, bats can become wet
which speeds hypothermia. The second reason is the risk of
hypothermia to the bats. The final reason is that some nerdy
caver may step on the bat.
If for one of these two reasons you must move him, in the
summer lift him up and try to make him attach to the ceiling or a
high wall. In the winter, do not wake him. Instead, try to
nudge him into a dry crack or small ledge well above the floor.
This entire subject can be summed up in one sentence:
TREAT BATS WITH RESPECT AND THEY WILL RESPECT YOU.
I would like to thank Zoologist Dr. Jack A. Cranford of the
Va. Tech Biology Department for taking the time to enlighten me
on the subject and thus help make this article possible.
