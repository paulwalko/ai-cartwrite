The floor of the huge room is mostly clay and dirt, but
there are also a lot of rocks and pieces of break-down. At one
point along the left side of the room, immense pieces of
break-down form a series of small maze passages. At one point,
the cave floor gives way to a large crater. This is the most
difficult part of an otherwise easy cave, and it requires a
little climbing. There seem to be quite a few passages leading
off the room, but we made no effort to push them. There are very
few formations in the cave; the ones that are around are mostly
dried up and crumbly. All in all, Ewing Saltpeter is a very
impressive cave from the standpoint of its size, and yet it is a
very easy cave.
After John Schelleng took some measurements and George
Titcomb took some pictures we headed out. After poking out in
some small holes on the other side of the mountain, we headed
back to Pennington Gap to tell of our adventures.
