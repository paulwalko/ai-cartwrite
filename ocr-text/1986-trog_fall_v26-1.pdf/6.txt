We could possibly have Convention 91 (the 50th anniversary)
in the New River Valley. Carolzo and Mike Fiore were our
delegates to Fall VAR. New River Gorge Bridge was closed again
this year for Bridge Day and once again a group of VPI cavers
were there to get a cheap thrill. No dead parachutists this
year. Craig Roberts has been having trainee bridge sessions
every week, but we don't seem to have a very large crop of
trainees this year.
Squires will be closed for renovations during Banquet '88,
So everyone keep on the lookout for a place to have Banquet that
year. Jackie Redder went to China over the summer to look at
caves (and a few other things) and had a slide party of her trip.
She's also teaching EMT class again. Keith Smith and John Lohner
had a drink-Tequila-howl-at-the-moon party that was a huge
success. Keith was setting off firecrackers in the kitchen
drawers, Jim Washington was seen dancing around in tights, Beth
Wichterman was the drunkest we've ever seen her in public, and
three people were almost hauled off to Christiansburg. The cops
decided to take in only Sue Setzler, but she still managed to go
to Stompbottom the next morning. Now that's dedication!
