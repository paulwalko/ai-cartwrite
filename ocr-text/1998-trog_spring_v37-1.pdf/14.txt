the floor. Patty was standing in the previous room.
"Okay " I replied and in quick succession
“Okay,” I replied and in quick succession the other
four section came through this hole as well.
We all made it through the little crawl, each with our
own difficulties, and each person using their own
choice of four letter expletives to aid their motivation.
With that obstacle behind us we were only five min-
utes from our goal.
"Here it is” said Steve as we all entered the small can-
yon type passage. Just as he described it: high on the
right hand wall there was an indentation that seemed
to say, "I go!" By this point we were all beginning to
tire but with possible passage in sight we energetical-
ly assembled the pole. To our dismay, after setting up
the pole and leaning it against the wall, we found that
it was about 5 feet below the ledge! “Okay, take the
pole and prop it up on the wall; it will hold,” Steve
said.
made final adjustments to our carbide lamps, I could
feel the cool air which sat in the entrance pit reaching
up to meet my face. The damp smell of the cave along
with the cool air was refreshing to me as I sat and
waited for the others to finish. This was still early OC-
tober and while we knew winter would soon be upon
us, today's temperature was well into high seventies,
quite a contrast to the 54 degree cave air.
"Wow, Patty, this one single section of pole is almost
bigger than you,” Bryce observed out loud. “Huh-
hh....huhhuhu.”
“Real funny Bryce,” she replied.
"It's all good, you know it is.” With that comment we
began our descent into cave.
Our goal was deep in the cave and our progress was
steady, silent. We easily passed through the upper
section of borehole passage, each person loaded
down with their personal cave pack and the extra
weight of a five foot long aluminum pole. Bryce car-
ried two sections. Upon coming to our first and only
drop, Steve and Patty quickly rigged the 75' rope we
had brought along and we all rappelled down to an
area know as the Suction Sewer.
The Suction Sewer is aptly named for the ankle and
near calf deep mud on the floor. The passage is too
wide to straddle the mud and everyone walked
through the middle. Sucking sounds of boots being
pulled out of the mud echoed through the passage as
the four of us progressed. "Damn this mud is sloppy
and holds tight,” I wailed as the Suction Sewer tried
to eat my left boot.
"Just keep moving," was Steve's answer.
I glanced at my watch, 4 hours underground already,
and we were just about to reach P.O.S. Pit. It would
take us another hour and a half to get everyone up the
pit and across the top. Spirits were still high though,
even though the poles were slowly becoming a tre-
mendous hindrance. More than once we had to pass
them from one person to another through tight spac-
es and here at P.O.S. Pit we raised each one separately
from the bottom on a piece of webbing. But the pole
climb was getting closer with every minute.
The last major obstacle before reaching the chamber
which held the climb was a tight “s” shaped crawl
which lead into a small room. Steve lead through
slowly inching forward on his left side. “Make sure
you start on your left side,” he yelled from the far side
of the passage. Body orientation is very important in
this passage, for in any other position a person's body
would not bend in the correct way. On the far side,
this sinusoidal passage entered the next room about
5 feet off of the ground. With nothing but air to hold
onto, the last move to get into the room was tricky
and I almost fell on my head into the room.
“Hey Bill, take my pole,” I heard Patty say. She was
looking up at me from an almost body sized hole near
"Yeah, right!” was my reply. “These walls are really
flaky and mud covered; it will never hold.” We had
traveled this far though and it had to be done some-
how was Steve's argument. We could not leave with
this type of defeat. So, as Steve requested the rest of
us lifted the pole up on to the wall and held it there
tight with our hands and shoulders.
"Dead end!” was the shout that echoed back down
from above. “Damn it, it looked so promising from
below.”
We all sat and ate quietly after Steve had come down
from the ledge, contemplating the what we had done,
thinking about the hopes of finding new passage, and
thinking about the long and tiring trip back to the sur-
face. With our meal done we packed up the pole and
began our return trip.
Upon returning to the small room with tight“s" crawl
in the wall, we had a frightful discovery; Bryce could
not fit back through the hole! Of course Bryce is an
experienced caver and he did not give up easily. We
all watched him make several attempts at passing
through the hole. Each attempt was to no avail. Bryce
wasn't going to exit the cave through that passage. His
only other option was to leave through the small hole
in the floor, where we had passed the scaling pole
pieces earlier. This hole was obviously too small for
him to pass through in its current condition, but pos-
sibly with a bit of modification he could fit. Luckily we
were prepared to do some digging and passage mod-
ification in case the pole lead needed it. We had no
idea that we would using it in one of the known pas-
sages.
With Bryce beginning to exhaust himself at attempt-
ing the “s” crawl, Patty suggested that he take a seat
and rest a bit while we hammered at the rock around
the small hole in the floor. “Okay," was his reply, but
we all could see that he was not enthusiastic about
having to sit. His jovial attitude from earlier in the day
