s gone. Steve, Patty, and I all took turns hammering
and Bryce sat on the opposite side of the room silent-
ly. “Bryce, if you start to get cold come on over here
and take a few swings to warm yourself up,” I said.
But he only looked at me and quietly said, “I'm al-
right."
After about an hour of hard work we had only made a
small dent in the rock. Bryce still sat quietly in the cor-
ner not wanting to talk. Patty whispered to me, "I
think being stuck here is getting to Bryce."
“No shit! I know I would be scared if this was happen-
ing to me,” I said.
“Do you think there is anything we can do to help
him?"
“Get him out of here and FAST!”
Several time over the next few hours we asked Bryce
to come over and attempt crawling through the hole
we were working on. Each time he would come over
and try feet first, then when that did not work he
would turn around and lower his head into the hole
and try to pass his shoulders through. Each time he
would do this in almost complete silence and with
what seemed like less and less motivation each time.
Now two and a half hours after we started hammering
at the rock we finally dislodged a large piece.
"Bryce we got it! Come on over and get the hell out of
here,” Steve said excitedly. With only a minor amount
of renewed enthusiasm Bryce walked over to the hole
and with only a little difficulty passed his head, shoul-
ders, and finally his waist through the hole. He was
out!
We all could see that a bit of tension was released
from his facial expression, but he was still deeply af-
fected by the whole situation. His eyes by this time
had a glassy appearance to them, and his face was a
bit pale. A mute walking giant. “Time to get moving
Bryce, how do you feel?” I asked.
No response. "Shake it off Bryce. We just need to cave
safely back to the surface and you will be alright.” I
said, trying to be enthusiastic.
“Let's go!" Steve said and we started off again. (Sever-
al weeks later we would name this small room where
Bryce got trapped for almost three hours, the CAVER
MOTEL. Where cavers check in but they don't check
out!)
Once again we moved steadily through the passages
heading back towards the surface. While Patty, Steve
and I tried to keep up the enthusiasm, Bryce never
once laughed or even looked half excited about any-
thing we said. Even sheep jokes had no effect on
Bryce's solemn attitude. He only stared straight
ahead. We were all worried about him, but each of us
also felt the best cure for his state of mind was be free
of the cold damp cave and it's dark passages. Bryce
needed the open sky. So trying not worry too much
about Bryce's attitude we kept caving.
It was now almost 3:00 a.m., 15 hours since we had
entered the cave, and we were once again approach-
ing the entrance to Starne's cave. As we all climbed up
towards the surface, large raindrops fell on our hel-
mets. Apparently a front had moved through the area
while we were underground and it had rained. Pur-
suaded by gusts of wind, the rain-soaked leaves were
now shedding their catch from the evening's rain
storm. The air was also much colder outside, no more
than in the mid 50's. The difference between cave
temperature and outside temperature was almost in-
distinguishable.
“Bryce, we made!” Patty said as soon as we all were
out of the cave.
"Yeah,” Was Bryce's subdued answer.
As we left the forested entrance and headed back out
into the fields, the rain drops stopped falling on our
heads. Above the field a full moon filled the night sky
intermittently as clouds raced by in front of it. Even
with the clouds above, there was ample light to see all
around the field where we stood. The clouds were
also illuminated by the moonlight. Each one had a
grey/white tint, backlit by the moon. I stood mesmer-
ized by the beautiful yet chilling night sky for a second
and then continued to follow the others. As I walked
up the hill towards the house and parking area the
wind continued to blow hard against my face. The for-
est leaves sang out in the silence of the early morning
hours.
