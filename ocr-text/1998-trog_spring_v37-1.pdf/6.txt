A MEASURE OF CAVE CLUB PURITY
SUBMITTED BY STEVE WELLS AND STEVE LEPERA
Just how pure are you? How do you rank with your friends? The chart below was created from the scores re-
ceived from the Purity Test which Steve and Steve forced on unsuspecting trainees and members alike. As your
score goes up, your purity level goes down.
The x-axis shows the score while the y-axis gives the number of people. Looks like the trainees have some
catching up to do!
