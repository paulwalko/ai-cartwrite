GROTTO GRAPEVINE
BY A.I. CARTWRIGHT
ROVING CAVERS
As usual, many cavers ditched their families over
Christmas and headed south. This Mexico trip con-
sisted of Steve Wells, Steve LePera, Joe Thompson,
Ray Sira, Jim Pugh, Mark Morton, Chris Rourke, Suzie
Warren, Dave Warren, Chris (Jake) Brown, and John
Deighan. While none of the lazy asses wrote a Trog ar-
ticle about the trip, Ray did manage to submit some
photos (randomly dispersed throughout this issue).
There were the usual explosions, beer drinking, and
illnesses. (Ask Jake about doing the "consolation
pit”.)
Not to be outdone, the richer folks flew to Amsterdam
for an extended weekend: Craig Ferguson, Dave
Shantz, Jerry and Joan Redder, Joan Johnson and Ko
Takimizawa, Bob and Jackie Hoell, Bob Simonds,
Doug Perkins, Bill Stringfellow, and Walt and Lynn Pi-
rie. Though temptation was great, Mr. Ferguson
claims that none of the travelers did anything illegal
while they were there. Hmm....
BANQUET '98
This year's Banquet was held, where else, at the New-
port Rec Center and catered by Steve Williams. Mike
and Andrea Futrell presented an interesting slide
show of their exploration in the caves of Borneo.
(Don't go there if you don't like bugs.) This year's
awards ceremony was hosted by Dave Colatosti and
his assistant, Mike Horne. (Dave should clearly have
his own late-night talk show.)

Lawrence Britt, for taking care of the rescue gear and
club files;
Mike Newsome and the Bat Ranchers, for opening
their home and their cave to us cavers;

ness through her work with Project Underground;

Thanks to heavy snowfall and poor mountain condi-
tions, a New Mexico trip was cancelled and instead
cavers spent a long weekend in TAG. Organized by
Sandy Knapp, the crew consisted of Sandy, Dave Co-
latosti, Eileen O'Malley, Katherine Shelor, Walt Pirie,
Barbara Graham, and Barry (Pyro) Fizer. They were
met by an offshoot of the returning Mexico trip: Steve,
Steve, and Joe. Thanks to Barry's wonderful meals,
the group had enough energy to bounce several pits
and actually spend time in a horizontal cave, Guffey's,
before dispersing for home.
