BY THE SKIN OF My Ass TRIP
BY BRAD ATKINSON
It was a cold, dark, and windy night at the Bat-Ranch,
and many people were tucked tightly into the hot tub
(in that ever so wonderful caver fashion) to the point
of overflow. When someone mentioned that the only
way this could become any better was to have a good
fun cave trip but with a twist, boy did I learn my les-
son: the twist being the lack of clothes. Some people
looked on as so to not catch the gaze of those who
had already decided upon going on this trip. Yet still
there were only two takers (their names will not be
shown in order to protect the innocent and not so in-
nocent) who I knew would have been first in line for
this trip anyway. So with that we began our ordeal of
getting ready. By the way, this is made very easy when
you a) don't have to remove any clothes, and b) you
don't have any wet muddy caving suit to put on.
As we took off towards Links we noticed that the wind
was blowing even harder and snowflakes were falling.
This is a bad thing when you are dressed for naked
caving (that is, if you call it dressed). When we were
at the opening of Links we had forgotten about the
cold or it's just that we were too afraid of the possibil-
ity of losing parts of our bodies underground. So now
the question is brought up, why can't human skin be
like cordura? As we entered the cave we began to note
how much warmer it is with no clothes and that it was
actually comfortable in there. Then came the hard
part, that being the slide down that is a few feet from
the entrance. For any of you nude cavers out there
you know this is something you do not do when you
cave in this way! So it became a climb down. By the
way I would like to take this time to mention that
nude caving will definitely improve one's caving abil-
ities mainly because you can no longer use your ass to
slide along in low ceiling areas, or your knees for that
matter.
Trudging on like real troopers we made it to the first
junction before the Wedding Room and we were very
happy because we still had all our parts. When we
made it to the Wedding Room we found it a great op-
portunity for a portrait so we could have proof we did
Links nude or just so we can have a picture show up
later on in the years after it had long since been de-
stroyed. This just goes to show things will always
show up at the worst possible time. After the photo
shoot we went through the “S” crawl; this still gives
me shivers because of the nicely placed puddle of
COLD water that a part of my body dragged through.
The crawl was not that bad, probably because the
walls had been worn somewhat smooth by the many
trips that have passed through there. The only bad
part was that someone other than myself had decided
to bring along his gas, too. Reaching the 5-9, green
and dazed by asphyxiation, we decided to try the 5-9,
which the other two did and I chickened out because
I found the rock to be a little closer to parts that it
should not be. With this being another fine and op-
portune moment for photos, some took breaks in
their climb in order to have a picture taken. Then it
was back through the S crawl and the trapped gas
back out into the Wedding Room. This is where we
had a splitting of ideas.
The other two wanted to go through the canyon sec-
tion which the thought sort of turned me a very pale
shade. So I then had to follow my instincts and stay
back to fill out the registry and to be able to walk out
of Links with all body parts intact. After a few minutes
they showed back up in what seemed one piece but I
was not going to look to closely for obvious reasons.
We mentioned we had been in there a little longer
than planned and so decided to head on out. By the
way, don't forget there was still the small climb at the
entrance to go up. This in itself could cause a grown
man to cry but we made it through it. While walking
back to the Ranch we noticed other people walking
up the hill from the barn, which turned out they were
checking on us since we had taken a little longer than
planned. I believe I even heard someone say “rescue”,
and if that is so the question is would it have been a
naked rescue?
