FIRST COMES LOVE, THEN COMES....
The club will celebrate two weddings this summer,
both on May 16th. Jean McCarthy and Richard Cobb,
who bought the old signout on Eakin Street, will wed
in the back yard. The party afterwards is sure to be a
blast. Said Jean, "People want to know if we'll be leav-
ing early to go on a honeymoon. What, and miss our
own party?!” That same day, Scott (Hoss) Leifer will
wed Laura Ludeke somewhere in Virginia. (If it isn't
Blacksburg, it's just somewhere else.) Shortly thereaf-
ter, they'll head out to Seattle, where Hoss has been
working in a fancy Italian restaurant. Laura has just
enough time to graduate and pack before she's mar-
ried and whisked away. (Does the word inbred mean
anything to these couples?)
THEN COMES BABY IN THE BABY CARRIAGE
After several years of marriage, Adam Hungerford and
his wife Tracey have reproduced. Jebediah David
Hungerford was born on April 15. The baby had a bit
of trouble getting out (not a promising caver!), but he
and Tracey are doing fine. Adam and family are living
in Pennsylvania.
BEWARE: RAMPANT DOMESTICATION
After an extended stay with Hugh Beard and Karen
Little, Daye Shantz has bought a house in Williams-
burg, Virginia. Dave claims, “I love the new house, but
it's awfully quiet without Hugh around.”
At about the same time, Paul Kirchman and Dabney
Hammer bought a house in Maryland. There's plenty
of back yard for chickens to roam and their dog Zeph-
yr to romp.
Steve Wells is attempting to purchase a true caver
house. If the deal goes through, he'll have eight

STILL GOING....
Hoss isn't the only caver to head out west. Carl Bern
moved to Washington recently, hoping to get a job as
a guide on Mt. Rainier. He's been training for several
weeks, and the guide try-outs are upcoming. Newly-
weds Patty Kitchin and Mark Leach hosted Carl's go-
ing away party, which consisted of cavers, climbers,
and other riffraff. Amy Johnson is hoping to find a job
near Washington when she's completed her Master's
Degree.
OTR?
Due to the problems the club encountered at last
year's OTR, many old farts have reason enough not to
return. There's talk of holding an alternative get-to-
gether on Labor Day Weekend for those who've had
their fill of OTR and its representatives. Possible
camping facilities will be discussed at this year's Pic-
nic.
“... nothing is more inviting than a dazed
and disabled coot idling on flat water."
- New York Times
Plenty of young farts and trainees plan to attend OTR
as usual. For these folks there's a big push for VPI to
kick ass in the vertical contests. Plans are underway to
hold regular rope racing sessions over the summer to
get folks fit and improve their times. If you are inter-
ested, talk to Eileen O'Malley or Ray Sira.
