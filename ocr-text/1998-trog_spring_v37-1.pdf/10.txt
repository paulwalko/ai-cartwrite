Rourke, having done an excellent job as Vice Presi-
dent, defeated Guido Garguilo to hold the position.
Although no one doubts Guido's caving abilities,
many felt that he should have a bit more time and ex-
perience with the club. Conveniently, Guido was im-
mediately voted in as Secretary. Not surprisingly,
Steve LePera was elected club Treasurer for the 4th
year in a row. (Hasn't he graduated yet?) Walt Pirie
was re-affirmed as the Faculty Advisor.
YTR
Sandy is always trying to organize something! This
time it was the Student Grotto Get-together, now
known as Young Timer's Reunion. Students from as
far away as Pennsylvania showed up at the WVACS
field house north of Lewisburg, WV on April 4th. Only
a handful of people didn't cave on Saturday, and that
was due to "excessive fun‚Äù the night before. The
camp-out weekend drew 66 cavers to the area. Of
those, 28 are from VPI. (Hey, someone's gotta show
these students how to party!)
CLUB OFFICERS
An amazing two trainees were voted in as club mem-
bers this semester. Chris (Guido) Garguilo became
member #367, and Judi Wazilewski became member
#368. Congrats to both! Joe Thompson has complet-
ed almost all of his requirements for membership, in-
cluding the exam, but hasn't managed to complete
the most intense, critical requirement of all: the Trog
article.
Election time came around, and this year's competi-
tion was sparse. Sandy Knapp stepped down as Presi-
dent since she'll be graduating in May. (In June she
begins working for VTLS in the Corporate Research
Center. She was replaced by Jessica Dorr, who prom-
ised to start meetings promptly at 7:00 p.m. (Yeah,
right. The very next meeting started late.) Chris
