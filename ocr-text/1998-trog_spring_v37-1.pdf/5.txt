TRIP REPORT: TAWNEY'S
BY JANICE MATHESON
We shall not cease from exploration
And the end of all our exploring
Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time.
-T. S. Eliot
I hesitate to go underground, it takes too much time
and energy to get ready and get organized. The world
above is consuming, devouring my energy and time.
Can I possibly spare the hours it takes to go under-
ground? Is this "wasted” time justifiable? But, I've nev-
er regretted any of my underground diversions.
Never regretted the weeks of soreness, the bruises,
the bleeding of my scraped dry hands, the muddy
torn clothes, and the money spent on equipment.
The time underground is not lost but transformed. I
emerge from the ground renewed, returning from ad-
ventures normal people won't have in a lifetime. Lin-
gering discomforts are fleeting souvenirs. This time
underground is my refreshing asynchronous chord
dropped in center of the monotonous and repetitive
symphony that is my life. This time is different, bold,
and risky.
In the darkness there might as well be nothing else.
For all I know when we turn out our lights, everything
vanishes into nothingness. Cave walls, formations,
bats, crickets, bodies, mud, and everything else
around me might just dissolve or change shape. For
this reason my faith strengthens in the dark. Not nec-
essarily a faith in God, but a faith in the rocks. I BE-
LIEVE they are not getting up and dancing or melting
into lava. In mud we trust.
Sounds grow deafening. Every movement of the peo-
ple around me becomes disturbing, interfering with
my study of the metronome-like tempo of the water
dripping from the ceiling, echoing, dripping, echo-
ing. Trying to adjust my breathing my life functions to
the rhythm of the surrounding environment. Silly
meditation, I am neglecting my social obligation to
entertain the others. New cayers intrigued by the
promise of something, lured underground. What do
they expect to see? What did I expect to see? I don't
remember. I try to go into new experiences without
many expectations or imagined scenarios, at least that
way I can't be disappointed.
I've been disappointed before. Life doesn't always sur-
pass the imagination. We are the misguided travelers
of Voltaire's Candide. “If we do not find anything very
pleasant, at least we shall find something new.”
Searching for happiness at the extremities of the
world, finding only pain and hardship before settling
for the contentment of a tranquil garden. Did they
overlook the joy of the pain and hardship? The bliss
of a painful journey terminates with the disappoint-
ing attainment of the destination.
I've been here many times, but I never realized how
much there is to see. I am impatient, attention-defi-
cient, and suffering from tunnel vision. Focusing my
light on the uneven ground before my feet, not look-
ing up at the glistening walls and ceilings. That has to
stop. Ancient water droplets collecting on the sides of
the cave look like precious diamonds glistening in the
light. Surrounded by droplets frozen in time, but not
really frozen. The deeper we venture into the earth's
crust, the slower the time seems to move. Water sus-
pended in another time dimension, collecting for
centuries before gaining enough mass to fall. Could
the gravity be different here too? The powerful myste-
rious power drawing us further underground, forcing
me to fall on even ground, and pulling me into the
crevices. Like an astronaut exploring the lunar sur-
face, I make adjustments to the gravity, the darkness,
the unheralded beauty of water, and the impact I have
on an environment lacking the turbulent forces of at-
mosphere.
Past the watery jewels there is a wall of fossils. The
rocky wall is covered with the small indentations of
seashells, each about a centimeter across. The under-
water history of the limestone comes to life. Oceanic
creatures die and collect under the pressure of the
deep waters. Their flesh decays, but the calcium of
shells and bones form rock under the immense pres-
sure of the sea. Pangea moves, and the rocks emerge
from the sea to form mountains, and the rainwater
carves a labyrinth of tunnels through the mountains.
I walk through the dead bodies of ancient sea life, an
earthly museum wall covered in their images, proving
their existence. I stare at them in awe, hundreds of
them from another time and place. Cave - porthole to
another world.
