THE TALE OF A CAVER CHANGED FOR LIFE
BY BILL STEIER
It was going to be a prolonged and arduous trip, a
minimum of 10 hours. Nonetheless it was also an im-
portant trip to close off a back section of Starnes cave
beyond P.O.S. Pit. The final lead at this section of cave
was a small hole near the ceiling of a 30' long by 10'
wide room. Steve Wells and a small group of other
cayers were the first people to visit this part of the
cave several weeks earlier, but without the aid of a
scaling pole on that trip they were unable to complete
exploration of the area.
Now some three weeks later Steve had convinced
three others members of the club to join him on a
scaling pole trip back to that far-off room. Steve, being
the monkey he is, graciously volunteered to be the
one to climb the cable ladder when the time came, if
the rest of us would help carry the 25 foot scaling pole
into the cave. Being typical pain-loving cavers Patty
Kitchen, Bryce Bolton, and myself, Bill Steier volun-
teered to carry in a five piece, 25 foot scaling pole
deep into Starnes. We would have to travel through
the Suction Sewer, over the 50 foot P.O.S. Pit and fi-
nally attempt to close off this lead. Little did we know
that this trip was going to be a trip that none of us
would ever forget.
The trip started as usual with a quick stop at Signout
where we left word of where we would be going and
when we were expected back. By 10:30 that morning
we were at the farm and preparing to begin our jour-
ney. It was sunny and warm as we got dressed, the
skies were blue. Just beyond our parking place is the
Price's house, a two story white farm house that looks
a bit like a mansion. Four tall white pillars decorate
the front of the house, stretching from the porch up
to meet the second floor roof. The porch was decorat-
ed with only two old rocking chairs and a few potted
plants.
Mr. Price does not care about cavers visiting Starnes,
but he also prefers not to bothered by cavers asking
for permission to enter the cave. He only requests
that people who visit the cave sign a log book which
he keeps in a mailbox near the caver parking area.
Personally I have never spoken to Mr. Price or his fam-
ily. I have only seen them on occasion working
around the house or in the fields. Today there was no
sign of anyone around; the house stood solemn and
quiet. While I find that most cave owners welcome
company and cayers for a short chat before entering
their cave, I find the mailbox routine a bit impersonal.
Perhaps one day I may get the chance to speak with
him.
As we began our walk to the cave entrance, Bryce was
having a hard time controlling his humorous tenden-
cies. "Hey this is a really big pole,” said Bryce, refer-
ring to one of his 5 foot sections. "It's sorta' like a
penis. The farther we slide it back into the cave, the
bigger it will get." And with that he started to laugh in
his uniquely Bryce fashion. Starting softly, as a deep
throaty sound made while exhaling in short puffs, and
ending in higher pitched tones. Quickly his comment
became more and more funny to himself and he be-
gan to get louder and louder. As we continued on the
laughing spell turned into a sort of laughing orgasm,
finally climaxing with, “It's all good...you know it is!”
It's sometimes hard to argue with Bryce since he
stands at over six feet tall and must weigh close to 200
pounds. Of course I would never consider him fat, or
obese. On the contrary he is very fit, in an extra large
kind of way. One might even say Bryce sized. I could
tell from this out of control beginning that we were in
for a weird trip to say the least.
As for the rest of us Patty and myself were excited
about seeing a new part of the cave that only one or
two previous parties had visited. This was going to be
as close to virgin passage as I had ever been, and if our
high lead went then I would be able to say I had seen
virgin passage. As we walked slowly through pasture
these thoughts of witnessing these unknown places
filled my head. To go where no man had gone before.
I felt like James T. Kirk, well maybe not. Still as we
walked past the old brown barn and I looked into the
distance at the many varied outcrops of limestone
rocks that dotted the field I could only wonder what
waited for us under this beautiful valley floor.
Lastly, I should not forget Steve, the ever confident
climber and cave whore, as he has come to be known.
No one quite knows whether his aptitude for climb-
ing stems from actual skill or just a lack of brains.
Whichever it is Steve was the first person to top out
and cross Piece of Shit Pit (P.O.S. Pit) on an earlier
scaling pole trip. As the story goes, the entire trip was
assembling the scaling pole and preparing for the
climb, while Steve chimneyed up a small canyon on
the near side of the dome and eventually crossed over
the top of the 50 foot pit unaided. For our group the
chimney maneuver required to reach the top of the
pit was easily accomplished, but due to the lack of a
belay position on the near side the first person had to
climb across unaided. Enter our fearless climber Steve
– that was to be his job on this trip as well. "No prob-
lem at all,” Steve said, "there are plenty of good hand
and foot holds up there. You basically just need to
lean forward over the pit, holding yourself with your
arms, and then bring your feet ahead and step over.”
He was right as we would later find out; it was not a
hard maneuver. Still the psychological effect of lean-
ing over this pit without protection of some kind was
a bit more than the rest of us could handle.
After walking up through the pasture and back down
the other side we were standing at the entrance to
Starnes cave. As we all stood near the entrance and
