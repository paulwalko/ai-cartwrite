ORGAN CAVE TRIP REPORT
BY AARON GORDON
This was the first weekend in about three weeks that
I had enough time to go caving, so I was actually very
excited to wake up at 8:00 on a Saturday morning. I
had heard a lot of talk about Organ cave, and this just
added to my anticipation. I quickly got my stuff to-
gether, ate breakfast, got dressed, and headed off to
Smyth to catch a ride.
In the parking lot I met up with Sandy Knapp and
Marc Zahn. We piled into Sandy's van and headed
over to signout. In the process of doing the signout
thing, we got together with Eileen O'Malley and Patri-
cia Feely. All of us got our gear together, and complet-
ed signing out. Then we headed off to Ray Sira's
house.
As we pulled into his driveway over the bridge, I
thought about the scenery and the whole attitude of
the area. This was one nicest areas I have seen.
The van came to a stop, and we all hopped out. As
Sandy went to get Ray, I noticed an old British sports
car sitting not to far from the van and I took a look at
it for a little while. After conversing, all the men left in
Ray's Truck, and all the women left in Sandy's van. I
have no idea how that happened.
Along the two-hour drive into West Virginia I forgot to
buy food to take into the cave. I was caught up in the
excitement and I just forgot. It was one of the stupid-
est things I have ever done. But it was a mistake I will
never make again.
After a short chitchat with the landowner, we parked,
changed, and went underground. It was the first time
I have ever gone totally electric, so I was definitely
anxious to see how it would be. We finally got into the
Lipps entrance around 12:00.
The entrance was rather plain passage, with some wa-
ter running at the bottom. This was the first time I had
noticed, but there were a lot of crickets hanging
around. We ended up going down the wrong passage
for a while, but luckily Ray had his trusty Organ cave
maps, and we were on track again towards the Lipps
maze. On the way there was a neat little crawl where
people had made nifty mud sculptures on a small
ledge. I thought that was very cool because I had nev-
er seen anything like it.
We got to the Lipps maze, which is a little jumble of
passages. After getting lost a few times and again con-
sulting the mighty maps we were on our way further
into the cave through a section called skid row. So far,
the cave had been mostly representative of the typical
cave systems I had seen so far. (For example, New Riv-
er, and James.) When we reached Jones Canyon I was
amazed at the size of the passage. Sometime during
the walk through one of these large passages, Ray
showed me the ceiling. He showed me how you could
trace the path of the original force of water that had
hollowed out the entire room. This was extremely fas-
cinating to me.
After that, our path went through a neat passage
called the breezeway into another huge passage
called the Handley room. This is where the register
was located, so we stopped for a snack and a rest. I
didn't have any food, but the rest of the gang was nice
and gave me something to eat. This room was another
giant room that amazed me.
The next passage of note was the passage to the Flack
room. This passage had a very scary hip crawl over a
tiny ledge. Nobody liked this move. It was my first real
encounter with exposure. During the crawl there is a
small period where you feel very uncomfortable, like
you are going to fall. I got through it very slowly, and
so did Patricia and Mark. Sandy and Ray however, be-
ing more experienced, had a lot less difficulty negoti-
ating it.
After this experience I felt good that I had done it and
this feeling of accomplishment made me like caving
even more. We rested a minute, then headed up
through the Floyd-Collins Highway. In this large pas-
sageway I noticed some rimstone dams formed where
some moving water was flowing through. Rat Alley
was next which was a long muddy crawl that had a
neat mud sculpture of a rat at the end of the passage.
This brought us out into the Bone room.
This was a huge room full of gigantic breakdown. Af-
ter scrambling around on this for a while, we realized
we were lost again, and hit the maps one more time.
By the time we got to the Sarver room we decided that
we had been in the cave long enough and planned the
quickest way back.
We climbed up the back of the Sarver room into a
long walking passage called Octopus Alley (or some-
thing very close to that.) At the beginning of this pas-
sage is where Ray had fallen on a previous trip, so It
was a point of interest and of conversation as we wait-
ed for people to climb up into the passage.
Next on the route was a neat room that had some
kind of knobby formations on the wall called the fun
room. This room led us back into the Flack room and
we once again traversed the terrible hip ledge. This
time, however, it wasn't nearly half as bad. It was
much easier to cross coming from the other direction.
From there on, we trudged back the same path we
came in. I noticed how quick it seemed to go in pro-
portion to the time it took us to come in. I guess not
getting lost, and anticipation made it seem shorter. I
also noticed that the crickets I had forgotten about
had re-appeared near the entrance passageways.
When we finally got out it was about 9:30 and it was
very cold. It didn't seem that long, but my knees told
me it had been a long time.
On the way back we stopped in a small Italian restau-
rant and ate dinner. We were all very tired, but I kept
thinking about how fun and interesting the trip was.
I couldn't wait to go caving in a cave as cool as that
again. I vowed that I would never forget food again,
and that I would buy some knee pads at the first op-
portunity I came across.
