TRIP REPORT: STARNES
BY CHRIS (GUIDO) GARGUILO
"Too bad you won't live; then again who does."
I heard the words echoing though the passages of
Starnes. As we left the Starnes I was familiar with and
headed to the new section I wondered how I ever got
into this.
It was the night before, at the meeting during trip
planning. None of the trips going out would keep me
out of town during the Tech vs. Miami game. Disap-
pointed, and preparing myself for a Tawney's trip, I
heard that Dave Colatosti and Kirk Digby needed a
third surveyor on their trip. Without thinking, I ran
over and volunteered on one condition; I would miss
the Miami game. I later realized that would not be a
problem at all.
Dave C. planned on picking me up at 9 AM. This was
before I was fully acclimated to caver time; Dave came
after 10. We then had to pick up Kirk and get all the
gear. By the time we made it underground it was
around one.
In order to get to the New Section, we had to traverse
several obstacles. Once we had rapelled down a drop
and climbed down few others, we reached the twelve
hundred-foot crawl. We inched along on our stom-
achs with our cave packs strapped to our legs. The
passage varies in size in the crawl. At some areas there
are small rooms and in others I could barely fit with
my pack on. We made it through this crawl in an hour.
When we arrived at the New Section, the passage
opened up into a very large room.
We rested a bit and had a little food. Dave and Kirk
were telling me about the New Section first aid kit.
Ask them about it some time. We then had to climb up
the bolt climb. It goes up next to a beautiful flowstone
formation. I found it moderately difficult to pass the
bolt. At the top was a very beautiful room. There were
several pools that each had rimstone formations and
crystal clear water. Along the walls there were soda
straw formations over a foot long.
We reached a tricky traverse over a small pit. Dave and
Kirk told me the drop was probably not enough to kill
you right away. It would be a few days until you died.
A rescue there would take days. By then any injury
that made a self-rescue impossible would most likely
kill the person. The thought of this made me a little
more cautious.
We soon reached the beginning of the survey point.
The room branched off into three passageways. I was
given the honor of traveling ahead into “Virgin” pas-
sage. Taking the tape, I headed into the unknown.
Stepping into a place where no one has ever been be-
fore is a very unique feeling. I was amazed just look-
ing at the mud floor and seeing nothing: no
footprints, garbage or signs of people. Looking
around a corner became as exciting as Christmas
morning. I never knew what I would find; the passage
could end, branch off or open up to a new room. As
we surveyed and searched around for new passages
this feeling of excitement never left.
We soon ran into a breakdown pile. It was full of
loose rocks and boulders. After moving several rocks,
I was able to make enough space between the pile
and the ceiling to squeeze through. I passed over and
around the breakdown pile to a wall with a small
hole. Shining my light in, I saw it opened up to a small
room. I had to dig a while in the mud to get the hole
large enough to squeeze through. The room didn't go
anywhere and the lead died.
Surveying is very tedious work. I would go ahead with
the tape to find a survey station. The next station had
to be in the line of sight of the previous station. When
I found a station, I would use my carbide lamp to
mark it with a black dot. I then held my light on the
station while Kirk took measurements. Dave recorded
the data and sketched the passage. I found surveying
pretty difficult. I tried to be as accurate as possible, as
quickly as possible. The tape got really muddy and
made it difficult to take measurements. I had to
scrape off the mud with my thumb before I could read
the tape.
We continued to survey other passages and leads.
There was one lead we found that was really nasty. It
was narrow, wet, and full of loose, sharp rocks. One
passage we found looked very promising. It was very
narrow and difficult to access. We had already been
underground for fifteen hours and none of us felt up
to pushing this lead. We decided to save it for next
time and headed back.
We were cold, wet, tired, and weak. Everything
seemed much harder. It took me longer to climb over
the "pit of a slow death”. I was now muddy and there-
fore slippery. The thought of getting hurt on the way
out was even scarier than getting hurt on the way in.
I managed to make it over without dying and we pro-
ceeded to the bolt climb. When we got there, Dave
and Kirk had to re-rig the rope. While I waited, I was
falling asleep standing up. The bolt climb was harder
on the way down because I was so exhausted. I could
barely lift myself up to unhook my ascender.
We were at the entrance to the crawl again. I knew the
way out was on the other side so I tried to go fast. Un-
fortunately, though, I found I could barely go through
it slowly. I was so tired, I would crawl a few feet then
collapse, rest, then crawl again. I did that for 1200
feet. The few small drops we climbed down on the
way in were now very tiring to climb up. We climbed
up the drop we rapelled down the day before as fast
as we could. By then I just wanted to get above
ground as fast as possible. I remember stumbling out
of the cave, dozing off as I walked. We made it above
ground about 20 hours after we went it. It was then
Sunday morning.
