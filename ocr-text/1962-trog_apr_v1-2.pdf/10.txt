left the main passage near where signs adv√ºrtise " Bear's Footh", we
headed back into a long single passage which was not included on the
map and seemed virtually endless. Olosing down to a wiggle it would
soon expand to walking nassages again and again. We eventually passed
a sign, written by someonewho had been impressed about the same as
we, which read, "Laurel Creek I mile". Shortly thereafter a long
vertical line had inscriptions on opnosite sides indicating Laurel
Creek Cave and Greenville Saltoeter Cave, all of which had been added
to by a more realistic individual (his conservation techniques were
not more realisite, however ) who added "ridiculous". Eventually it
did end in a pile of breakdown and a profusion of NSS numbers, estimat-
ed to be well over 1,092 feet off of the mar, published in Davies,
Caverns of West Virginia.
Returning to the main upper level we literally ran do wn sandy
floored passages about five feet high and stretching further than a
person could see. Climbing down to one side we again reached water
and the nearest thing to quicksand I ever hope to see. Court, Bauer,
Lipscomb, and I waded into the muck until, while in six inches of
water, we were half way up our thighs in mud. Grinning nodules on
the ceiling it was possible to raise one leg and move forward, but
as the ceiling became lower we had to turn back. Trying another area
we went until Bauer was chin deep in water and Court was gasping
for breath and screaming something about ice and soggy cigarettes.
As for Lipscomb, well... the bandage didn't quite stay dry.
With the party whittled down to six: drowned rats we headed into
the last remaining major lead, which headeri to the left from the en-
$lance passage, and was a little damn. In knee deep water more often
then not and despite Bonniers muttering about idiots we sola sh ed and
-slid back to a point where water rushing into tire cave entrance hod
deposited tree branches and telephone noles
Coming out we passed a section of a nad bridge which had like-
wi se been carried 'well into the cave by flood waters, and Bonnie, who
had so mehow managed to stay dry above the waist this far, slipped and
fill in. Soaking wet and extremely colc no emerged from the cave with
the feeling that no one has ever been caving who has not been to Lau-
riol Creek. This cave will certainly have to be included in the pre-
convention Caving program for the 1963 NSS national Convention.
After thoroughly cleaning our campground and thanking the farmer
for letting us sl een on his property, we decided to look at the ent-
race to nearby Greenville Saltpeter. Watching the stream rushing
into the immense entrance and disapnearing into the blackness, we
vowed to return in the very near future (before the water level goes
ob wn).
Returning home the inevitable cleaning up and resting up begin.
I understand that at ll: 30 Monday morning Linscombis father just
hanpened to dron by and Lind Bill still in hed. It was a dull lecture
anyhow... they tell me.
An immature salamander, probably Pseudotriton porphyriticus
Piticus and a
an millip ed were collected in Laurel Creek.

SCHOOLHOUSE CAVE AND THIEVERV

The snow was two inches deep when we took off from Vienna, Va.

undaunted. Our party of three consisted of Doug Dolan and Jeff
Pollard, of Vienna, and myself. Wo arrived at the Pittsburg Grotto
