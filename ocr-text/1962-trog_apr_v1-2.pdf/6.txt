THE TECH TROGLODYTE, Vol.I, No.2

PROJECT POOP
ED BAUER
Now that I'm back from my "extended vacation", I hope
to set the wheels into motion and get a few of our projects
closer to completion.
John "Zeke" Fuller has agreed to undertake the enormous task
of writing up a history of the VPI Grotto. While the completion
of this history by the May contest deadline is quite out of the
question, it is hoped that it will be completed before the ond
of the summer. Due to the facts that the VPI Grotto is one of
the society's oldest and that the membership and leadership
are continually changing, it looks as if Zeke has quite a job
on his hands. Any of the founders or older members of the grotto
are asked to send helpful information to Zeke at Box 3695.
Another plea goes out, this time by the group working on the
slide-lecture series on conservation, to anyone who might have
slides depicting good or poor conservation policies. We will
copy the slides and return them as soon as possible. Please
send any slides or inquiries to me at box 2723.
Little work has been done on the Higgenbotham Caves (Virginia)
Project lately other than the correlation of some of the notes
taken on the last survey trip. With the warmer and dryer
weather on its way, it is hoped that a few trips will be going
to that immediate area soon,
A newcomer to the evergrowing list of grotto projects relates
directly to conservation and cave beauty. The National Conven-
tion in 1963, for which we will be host grotto, presents a good
excuse to begin work on the restoration of caves in this area.
Caves to be cleaned first will be those most probably visited
by pre-convention cavers: Tawney's, New River, Pig Hole, and
Giant-Caverns. When work on these is completed, work will begin
on other vandalized caves in the area. Buckets, brushes, and
everything but soap will be carried into the affected caves in
the hope of removing any foreign material. As soon as possible,
cave registers will be placed in these and other caves in the
area.
VA. REGION PROJECT DATE CHANGED
According to a recent announcement by the chairman of the
Virginia Region of the NSS, the date of the Virginia Region Pro-
ject at McClung's Cave, Greenbriar County, West Virginia, has in
been changed to May 12&13. Although originally scheduled for
the preceeding weekend, the weekend of the 12 & 13 seems to be
more convenient to more people.
This trip will formally initiate a long-range study which
has been planned for McClung's and the surrounding area. Ex-
ploration, mapping, and hydro-geological studies will be con-
duoted and will include several nearby caves.
Camping facilities will be available approximately four miles
from the cave, on the Greenbriar River near the town of Anthony.
Participating cavers will assemble at the cave entrance at.
9:00 AM Saturday. All persons are asked to park on the road
near the cave? but not in the driveway or lane of the owner, and
sign a log book which is maintained by the owner, Mr. Freeman.
Notices regarding the project will be sent to all NSS members
in the Virginia Region and details on the aims and organization
thereof will appear in the April Issue of the Doc. Speleagraph.
