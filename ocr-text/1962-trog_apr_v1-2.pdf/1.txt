EDITORIAL
In opening the second issue of the TECH TROGLODYTE We would Iike
to thank the many people from whom we have received lind comrients and
words of encouragment concerning our initial issue. We would also like
to thank those groups who have responded with exchange subscriptions to
their respective publications. These publications will be kept on file
in the editorial offices of the TROGLODYTE (Room 1 28 Femoyer dormitory)
where they will be accessible to members of the Cave Club and other
interested parties.
Believing, as we do, that encouraging better conservation practices
is one of the primary goals of organized cavers, a large portion of the
second issue is being devoted to articles on conservation, both original
and reprints. It is felt that these articles gives a wide, yet fairly
comprehensive view of the neces ity for and principles of cave conser-
vation with which all cavers should be familiar, .In a group such as
ours, where the membership is constantly changing with the graduation
of the experienced and the influx of freshmen, it is felt that a con-
stant educational process on conservation is essential; and in no group
can it be overly stressed. It is hoped that several of the articles
in this issue, along with others of a similar naturc, some on caves
safety, and other pertinent information can be assembled into a boolim
let which will be distributed among and made required reading for in-
coming members, as a part of the "trainee" program,
