NSS POLICY FOR CAVE COI'SERVATICI!
The National Spolcological Society bolicves: That caves havo
unique scientific, rocroational, and sconic values: That these values
are endangered by both carelessness and intėntional vandalism; That
these values once gone, cannct be recovered; and that the responsi-
bility for protecting caves must be assumed by those who study and
enjoy them.
Accordingly, the intention of the Society is to work for the pre-
servation of caves with a realistic policy supportod by effective
programs for: the encouragemont of selfwdiscipline among cavcrsi ed-
ucation and researc!, concerning the causes and prevention ci cave
damage; and special projects, including co-operation with cther groups
similarly dedicated to the conservation of natural areas. Specifically:
All contents of a cavem-formations, life, and loose deposits-
are significant for its enjoyment and interprótětion, Thorcfore, cavo
ing parties should leave a cave as they ſind it. They should provide
means for the removal of waste linit marking to as few, small and
removable signs as aro nuodod for survoys; and, especially, exercise
extrome care not to accidently brcalc or soil formations, disturb Iife-
forms or unnecessarily increaso tac number oi disfiguring paths through
an arca.
Scientific collection is professional, selective and minimal. The
collecting of mineral or biological matorial for display purposes
including previously broken or deed specimens, is never justifieds as
it encourages others to collect and destroys the interest of the cave.
The Society encouragos projects such as: ostablishing cave pre-
sorves; placing entrance-gatos where-appropriates - cpposing the sale
of spelcothems; supporting ciicctivo protective measures; cleaning
and restoring over-used cavos; CC-cperating with private cave owners
by providing knowledge about thcir cavo and assisting thom in protest-
ing their cave and property from dariago during cavo visits; and on-
couraging commiercial cave ovinors to make use of their opportunity to
aid the public in understanding caves and tho iriportance of their con-
servation.
There there is reason to believe that publication of cave loca-
tions will Ioad to vandalism boforo adequate protoction can be estab-
Tished, tho Society will oppose such publication.
It is the duty of overy Society momber to take per:sonal responsi-
bility for spreading a consciousness of the cave conservation probiom
to cach potential user of caves. Without this, the beauty and value
of our Caves will not long romain vith us.

The following article is based, in part, on a similar treatmont

which must continually bo brought to tho public's as wel? as to the
