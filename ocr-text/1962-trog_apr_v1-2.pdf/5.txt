difficult to inspire in non-Cave Club norbers who continuc, as always,
to have a desiro to 11oke known their r12;;culine prowess and leave evi-
dence of having visited such-and-such a pleco
It is my conclusion that if'Cave maps wore not available to the
student body through the library, but rather loopt solely in tiza club
files for access o club members, that incidents of vandalism in near-
by caves vould, if not declino, cort:inly not incrorse. It is also
felt that those individuals in the college who are sincerely interested
in cavins will take advantage of the opportunities offered by the Cave
Club, be properly instructed in the necessity of Crve conservation,
and thereby avoaccess to information on cave locations (thus nonone.
who is consciontiously interested in onving would be doprived of in-
formation on cavos by the omission of that information from tize school
library).
In conclusion, this publication will officially go on rocord as '
opnosing the placing of aditional cave rieps in tho VPI Library. Also,
as it is intended that this publication beloont on filo in the library
in hopes that some non-Cave Club morbors may become acquainted with the
policies advocated herein; whicrever it is felt advisable, Cave lo-
cations will be stric?re from thosc copios filed in the library.
TROGLODYTE ARTIST RECOGNIZED
We have just realized that at no place in our initial issue did
we recognize the creator of the troglodyte which adorns our masthead.
John Danner did the artwork and, as much as we hate to admit it, yourg
truly posed to get the correct proportions. Any resemblance is purely.
coincidental,
Also, our thanks to El Bauer for the aid rendered in all aspects
of the publication of this issue, Our masthead was originally print-
ed in such quantity so as to last for three issues. At that time it
will be changed so as to not include the staff which may then be
changed as necessity requireso
