Now, after you have tied in, you may concentrate on stopping your
leader in case he falls. He is tied to the end of the belay rone which
goes back to you. The rone goes from him, around your seat and under
your tie in, after passing thro'igh a carabiner attached to your waist
coil on the climbers side of you, (the rens on why will be explained
later) and hence into your hand on the on site side of your body from
the carabiner. In the event the climber falls, the rope will pull tight
and run around you very ronidly. It is up to you to stop him sofely -
and dynamically. This is done by using the friction of the rope nn.
your body, not by grinning tightly with your hands. The rone is low
on you seat because when the rope is running, the hent generated by
friction will surely burn you if it is concentrated in one small area.
The rone, then pulled tight, will tend to ride up to the small of the
back. This riding up of the ronë tends to spread the frictional heat-
over a large area and keeps you from betting burned.
The carabiner on the climbers side is to stop the rope from under
you in case the pull is from below. In load climbing, the pull will
normally be from above, hence the rone below the tie in line; but if he
falls below you, in the event his safety niton pulls out, the pull will
first from above and then from below. horeforo you must always be
prepared for a pull from cither direction.
There are rules which must always be obeyed whon beləying.
1. Always tie in,
2. Always expoċt à fall with a resulting pull from either
above or below.
3. 4lways wear glovos.
Always be flert.
5. Never take your breaking hand off of the rope.

He also willingly, or was it unwillingly, George) agreed to act as
coordinator of transport to Conference. Polly Hopkins (MWC) agreed to
make the necessary arrangements for an IOCA-wide fall trip to the
Senaca Rocks area. Charlotte Brunner (MWC) agreed to coordinate trans-

Caves visited over the weekend wore Tawneyis, New River, Craig
County Saltpeter, and a cave near where Craig County Saltpeter Cave
should be, Climbers visiting nearby Dragon's Tooth found that the
wasps were there first that they were very effective in retaining
thier positions. A midnight hike prooved to one G.F, that it would have
been easier to climb over a certain fence than to bust into it at full
tilt. We feel it our duty to mention here (game wardens take note) that
Mike Rosenheimer caught his first trout, 15 minutes before the season
