+2. Rather than a conflict, our own dual role in the N.S.S. and in
120.C.A. ideally serves, the purpose for which we are recognized by each
of these organizations.4
I would appreciate the opnortunity to hear another viewnoint on
this subject.
Editor's Notes:
1.) It was Mr. Rosenheimer who, after attending Rensselaer. Foly-
technic Institute and holding membershin it the outing club there,
originally introduced the 1.0.0.A. program within our club.
2.) It seems that we should remember that we are first an individ-
ual club and the majority of our activities should be for our club mem-
bers without having to invite the rest of the world to join us, or
travel halfway around the globe to join them,
3.) It apnears that Mr. Rosenheimer is saying that the size and
influence of our club is a result of its diversity. He should take
note of the fact that prior to this yeor very few activities other than
caving were engaged in, and even now only a very few of the individuals
are interested in large organized outings other than coving. Most other
activities are on a small scale and within our own membership,
The strength and interest in the club seems to us a direct out-
growth of the fact that the Cave Club offers not only an opnortunity
for socializing, but a chance to learn and accomplish worthwhile
objectives in the fields of exploration and scientific study. If we
were to become, as he suggests, a club which is dancing at Mary Washing-
ton one weekend, rock-climbing in New York the next, and playing host
to an assortment of would-be cavers the next, our worthwhile objectives
would suffer and the club would become merely an expensive social
organization.
It is staying as a separate club, eng ging on occasion in activ-
ities with other groups, that we hnve been able to make worthwhile
contributions to the knowledge of caves and maintain an interested
membership.
40 ) Granted that we should join in activities with both groups,
but the major portion of our activities should be within our own club.
It also seems that within the N.S.S. We ave the opnortunity to learn
while in 1.0.0.A. We spend our time teaching while most of those being
taught do not want to learn, Wo should learn during our encounters
with the A.S.S. and by rending its literature so that we can apnly
this knowledge to our own activities and studies, and on occasion com-
municat, via joint activities and our publication, our knowledge
gained to others.
"Society is commonly too cheap. We meet at very short intervals
not having had time to acruire any new value for Onch other...We live
thick and are in each others way, and stumble over one another... cer-
tainly less frequency would suffice for all important and hearty

1.0.0.A. VS. THE N.S.S.
by George Fairer
(secretary- Blue Ridge -
Region, 1.0.0.A.
Actually the title of this article is misleading. There are no
grounds of any kind for any differences between the IOCA and the NSS;
especially in this region, the BROCA region.
The National Speleological Society is an organization which gath-
ers together and coordinates people who are interested in all aspects
of caving whether it is intended just as asport or as a science,
The people who engage in caving are usually interested in the fields
