THE TECH TROGLODYTE, Vol. I, No. 2.
page 28
It appears to us that Larry in no way asked for credit for work
done by otherg but merely mentioned the accomplishments in the cave in
which he and others well known in this aria played an important role.
He did not take credit for the map but reproduced it as an aid to under-
stading his article,
The comnlaints raised seem to originate from the fact that Larry
continually uses the term "we" and fails to identify "we", This is
regrettable. Also, he probably have mentioned the individuals respon-
sible for the map, but other than this we find little objection to the
article, and no objection whatsoever to its intent or its author. To
take another sentence from Mrs. Corrie's letter, "The article is about
Larry, not about the cave," This is true to a large degree.
on the map sent to us by Mr, Merrill the following credit apneared.

Fossibly publication on this issue should have been restricted to
mentioning those individuals who should have been mentioned in the
original article, but Mr, Griffin is a fine individual and an outstand-
ing caver and we would hate to see this matter widely discussed by
individuals not acquainted with the entire situation, as it apparently
has been,
Also, we will be glad to accept any write-up on this cave by any-
one who feels that he can give a more accurate picture of the cove
without being influenced by personal prejudices.
CAVE CLUP OR OUTING CLUB?
editorial
"Your outing club certainly seems to do a lot of c-ving". With
this statement a boy from the University of Massachusetts who was
attending the 1.0.0.Ai caving program to which we were host brought to
a head a question which has been smoldering within the club for several
months. Weive always been under the impression that we were a member
of the VTI Cave Club but all of a sudden it seems that actually it is
the VFI Outing Club, It seems that a small portion of our membership
has suddenly decided and impressed upon others that we are in reality
an outing olub.
Certainly the club cannot go on as it now exists, the name, consti-
tution, and some of its members a cave club, and the rest of the member-
ship an outing club. i
One of three things must surely hapnen. First, the club could
split into a cave club and an outing club. This would seem to be a
very unwise move for both would lose strength and one would undoubtedly
die within a very few years.
second, the club could change its name to the VPI Outing Club,
write a constitution, etc. to correspond and establish specialized
committees, one of which would be a caving committee. This committee
alone would then function as #grotto of the N.s.s. The membership of
the club could then be expanded to include all of those people in this
school who are interested in other outings, rather than heing restricted
to those interested in caving.
Or third, and far preferred in this quarter, the club could do as
it seemed it was going to do when the 1.0.9.4. business was originally
introduced and rem in a cave club, a grotto of the N.9. S. and establish
a committee which would maintain contact and relations with 1.0.9.A,
