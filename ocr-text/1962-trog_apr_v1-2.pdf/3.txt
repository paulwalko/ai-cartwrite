Among the greatest threats to cavernicolous organisms are the
large number of people who pass through the more accessible caves in
the winter months. The winter season is the time of hiberna tion for
many of our cove-dwelling animols such as insects and bats. Then these
animals are disturbed or airakened from hibernation few, ii any, can
find enough available food for the maintenance of their life processes,
Most of the troglobites have adapted their bodies to the relatively
constant cave temperature. This leads to a delicate balance between
their natabolic rate and the enviroinental teriperature, When this
balance is disturbed by an increase in temperature, a subsequent in-
crease in their rate of metabolism also occurs and as consequence
an upset occurs between the food required by these organisms and the
food available. This is ė very realistic problem when takes into ac-
count the meager food sup::ly that normally exists in a cave 12bitat,
Another menace to cave life is the cereless dumping of carbide in
vet areas, pools, ona cave streams. Colcium carbide produces acetylene
gas and calcium hydroxide when it is combined with water, Calcium
hydroxide can increase the alkalinity of water to such a degree that
the pH value will rise enough to kill any aquatic species present, .
The solid particles of carbide in water con 51so pollute the stream,
notwithstanding the ph factor. licny on the non-acuatic cave forms,
such as insects, feed on decaying organic material en carbide is
mixed with organic material, this material then becomes a poison rather
than a valuable food supply. Then left in a cove, carbide should be
covered or buried in a dry spot well away from runnin water,
The fact that our cove life is rare and unusual ha, made it a
prine target for collectors in the past few years. Hany such collector's
are amateurs ona laynen who nerely desire specimens for "show" rather
than for scientific study. A certain amount of the blanc must also be
borne by the well-1202 ning scientist, who often takes more specimens
than would be absolutely necessary. This situation has unfortunately
caused the decins tion of whole colonios of rare animals and , in sone
instances, practics17y complete extinction of rare species. As several
bio-speloologists have pointed out, it is much more desirable to study
these r re animals in their natural surroundings than to place then in
alcohol on Sorio riuseum shell. Little-inderstood habits of these unique
organismis 311ch cis breeding, larval stages, feeding, reaction to stimuli,
and longevity can be more accurately observed and studied in the native
labítat than in a loboritory. This is not to say that there are not
certain instances wher collection 1. desirable, but such decisions
should be left to a competent cave biologist.
One of the chief sources of the scarce food lipnly in caves is bat
guano. In some instances guano ny he the only available food for
certain covernicolouS spocies. In addition to this, grano may also
serve as to organic nutrient for the growth of various types of fungi.
Fungi, in turn, is an import: nt ford source for insects. Consideration
must be given, then, to the idea of blocking up or serling off a cave
entrance, even if only to proserve the remaining cave life inside,
ihis will obviously lead to moro 127 Ii? than good iſ such animals as
