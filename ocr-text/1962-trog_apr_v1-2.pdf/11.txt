fieldhouse at 1 a.m. Saturday, got a bite to eat, and hit the sack.
Cooking breakfast the next morning was made impossible by the lack
of gas and firewond, so we ate a cold meal. When we had almost finished
this we were interrupted by a lod-sent call from Mrs. Smith, asking if
We wanted breakfast. Naturally we couldn't resist. After our second
breakfast we set ount to gather firewood. We filled most of the car.
At noon we entered Schoolhouse. I was the first to go down the
grand rapnel. I overshot the "Nick-of-Time" slightly but recovered with
very little trouble, and tied in the bottom of the rope. Jeff came next.
As he came over the "Nick-of-Time", he slipned and fell into the North
Well, hitting against the far wall and drop ing his lamp to the bottom
of the well. Instead of yelling tfalling" he merely screamed. Of cour-
se, Doug, who was belaying him, caught him instantly and held him while
I proceeded to pull him to safety with the bottom end of the rope.
After Doug got down, we rigged a rone down the well, and I went
down to get Joffis lamp. It was somewhat damaged but I got it working
again. I then came around under the "Nick-of-Time" and found several
hundred feet of rone and ladder in good condition. I recalled hearing
of such equipment being abandoned there several months ago and decided
to selvage two of the rones, They were water-logged and very heavy, but
we hauled them up to the "Nick', then we continued into the cave,
Since we had lost a lot of time, we did not go all of the way to the
back of the cave this time, but turned around at the top of the Thunder-
bolt Room,
We returned to the big room without incident, but we were storting
to get pretty tired. We ate a can of fruit and rested awhile, Doug
and Jeff prussikked up to the mud Grotto, but couldn't get over the
next breakover, so they waited there. I tied all of the equirment to
the belay rone and staited to prussik up the main rope, unsnagging the
equirment as Doug and Jeff hauled from above. It was very exhausting
to all three of us due to the weight of the rones we had found.
We finally dragged ourselves out of the Grotto to below the Jumning
Off Place, There, due to our fatigue, we decided to leave most of our
equipment, while we returned to the fieldhouse,
We s√≠ent quite lote Sunday morning and Mrs. Smith was kind enough
to fix us breakfast. After thrt, we headed back to the cove, stonping
to look at Hell Hole on the way. When we reached the Jumning Off Place,
we could see immediately thot something was wrong. We had left some of
our equipment all of the way at the ton. This was gone. Looking over
the breakover, we could see that only a coupic of the items were still
there, but most significant was the fact that the rone we had nulled
up but left rigged was down over both breakovers again and that it was
taut as if someone were on it! No one answered our calls and we could
not budge the rope, So we left in a hurry And returned with a West
Virginia st?te trooper. We took him to the jumping Off Place and he.
incidentally, was quite thrilled. Again we could not budge the rope.
Doug and I went down to the second breakover and found the rone
merely snagged. We freed it, but the rone, formerly 200 feet long and
brand new, had had 90 feet out from it. We salvaged what was left of
our equipment and left. Our total loss, shared by Doing and I, amounted
to about $70. Needless to say we are offering a reward for the
apprehension of the thieves. Evidence indicates that the thieves (or
thief) were experienced covers.
We returned to the fieldhouse at 7 p.m. It han just started to
snow. We ate dinner at Mrs. Smith's, cleaned the fieldhouse and left
by 9. Already there was almost two inches of snow and my gas guage -
read empty! The plows had not been through yet and the first mountain
