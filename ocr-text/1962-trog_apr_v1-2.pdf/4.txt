CAVE LOCATIONS:
TO PUBLISH OR NOT TO PUBLI 3H
by Gregg Marland
The questionability of publishing cave locations was again brought
to mind by a recent incident in the VPI library. Upon approaching
the drawer where cave maps are kept, I found two others, who I had not
previously met through Cave Club activities, looking through the maps.
Assuning them to be interested cavers and possible recruits for the
Cave Club, I offered to help them if there was anything in particular
that they were searching for.
I. was informed by one that he was looking for bets and was in
turn asked if I knew where any large numbers of bats could be found.
Questioning him further, I found that he was interested in a particular
bat parasite. Why? "Just Curiosity". Further questioning revealed
that in order to locate this parasite he grabbed bats at random, stuffed
them into a jar of cyanide, and later picked over the dead bats' to find
the parasites. ile informed me that on a previous trip to Tazewell
County he had failed to turn up any of the parasites which he wanted
for "JUST CURIOSITY", but failed to mention how many bats he had des-
troyed in the process. He was presently looking through the maps at
such places as "Bat Room, or "Bat Section for places where he might
be able to find many bats. His definition of many bats, "Oh, more
than a dozen." He apparently just grabbed any bat that he could lay
his hands on.
After learning all of the above details, I imr:edia tely entered
into a discussion of the importance of bats, the need for their con-
servation, and the possibilities of entering into properly conducted
scientific studies through corresponding with those more educited in
the field of bats, if he was really interested in their study.
It turned out that he was "not interested insthe bats" but just
curious about the parasite which he hopod to collect in as large a
quantity as possible, and my pleas fell on deaf ears.
Controlling my emotions marvelously, maybe too well, I left won-
dering what could actually be done, while turning the ideas over in
my mind, I came to the conclusion that it was probably through the
availibility of this file of maps (which numbers about wo) that many
people learned of the existence and location of New River Cave and others
in this area that havo been so cominonly visited and so badly vandalized
by unorganiqed groups of cavers, Now River has felt the brunt of the
attack, but other caves--primarily those that are nearby, easily ac-
cessible, and have their inaps on filo in the library-mheve beon pias-
tered with the initials "VPI", and an abundance of naries of daring
individuals who want the world to know of their heroic efforts in having
visited this place or that. WUVT (the campus radio station) and the
names of various RO TC companies on campus are also frequently found. ?
Although a number of these nanes cre those of Cave Club members,
in fact an alarmingly lrrge number of tiem, these inscriptions are in
a very definite minority and have suffered a tremendous decline in the
last two years. There has been a tremendous and most encouraging
growth in interest in conservation among Cave Club members and it is
felt that incidents of vandalism among grotto mombers are rapidly ap-
proaching non-existence. Flowever, this conservation consciousness is
