notes were on envelopes and scraps of paper, apparently left well be-
fore a notebook was left. While the others were signing in, I searched
through the assembladge of papers, Boy Scout cards, calling cards,
pictures, and other reminiscences. One member of our club was repre-
sented by a calling which, apparently altered by subsequent cavers,
read George "Rocky" Fairer.
On the way out we spent considerable time admiring the profusion
of gypsum flowers which adorn portions of the ceiling and at the same
time, condemning the warped idiots who have damaged numerous specimens.
Nevertheless, specimens up to eight inches in length and of consider-
ablo beauty were found in some of the more remote sections.
We also visited the "wench" which was used by the saltpeter miners
and has been perfectly preserved to this day.
Another notable find was a first aid kit in a plastic bag which
had been left in the cave for the emergency use of visiting cavers,
The kit contained essential first aid supplies along with flashlight
batteries and other items
. Leaving the cave, we headed toward Union and the grocery store,
noticing that courtis car had a hole in the muffler as a result of
the journey. If you have never seen nine people in a small grocery
store, all trying to decide what we were going to eat and picking this
and that, you cannot d'imagine the scene that followed, Believe it or
not, we did eventually come up with a resonable menu and enough gro-
ceries to feed an army; then came the fun of dividing the cost by
nine and fighting it out,
The next stop was an AMOCO gas station whəre court; became quite
embarressed when he bought 9€ worth of gas for Olit? Colman stove and
had to wait for his change from a quarter. Ill. 69 that tha attendant
is still scratching his head, and I'll admit that I've never seen a
facial expression quite like his.
Arriving at the home of the owner of Laurei Creek Cave just after
dark, Dave and I tried to get to the house and fought vifch the gate
latch for several minutes before getting ?? and obtaining permission
to camp near the entrance, Leaving, we reitli zed that we had unlatched
the gate chain from the wrong end and subsequcntly spent five more
minutes getting it back together,
setting up camp on the far side of the creek from the cave mouth,
things were just getting going and the stew sering when the rains
came, Quickly covering everything wuth a tarp, Bauer und Lipscomb went
around by the roaå brloge and, being the only one wear irig Bermuda
shorts, giless wild was elected to ferry the gear across the stream
which was kinee deep a roaring into the 32ve enirano u 70m sleeping
bags to stove with stovi 36iil bubblizi. We soon passe everything
across and set up carp inside the larges Davei'n entrance on the left
bank of the stream and put our chef, Bernie, to work again, After de-
vouring the results of her culinary genius, we set about the task of
pushing aside enough cow piles to roll cut our damp sleeping bags.
After a comparitively sleepless night we enjoyed another excellent
meal prepared jointly by Bonnie ana Daveig and were joined by Jim
Saunders and Chris Schlecko After Tapping Lipsconib!s hand (he had a
row of stitches across the right pa -m) we headed back into the dark
reaches of the caves
When Saunders first jumped knee...deep into water we all shuddered
and followed, not knowing what lay aheaa. Toilowing tremendous sand
floored passeges and marvelling at the va? 11:37. CSsive tunnels, we
soon exhausted the lower level anü tesan a search for the upner level.
