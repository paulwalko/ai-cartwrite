hiking, climbing, and nature in general because of the close correla
ation between these fields. If one enters a cave, he naturally has to
call upon the skills and techniques of these diversified fields to
accomplish the exploration of the cave in an efficient, practical,
and safe manor. True, techniques.-may be modified when carried from
one field to another as in the case of vertical or pit caving and
rock climbing. The aspect is somewhat different, for in caving you
start at the top, go down and then climb up, where as in rock climb-
you start at the bottom, climb up, and then return to the bottem. The
aspects are different but, the techniques are basically the same.
A belay, whether used in the fiald of climbing or caving, is corr-
ect in it's use by the means of only one me chodc I o participate in
both fields safely, the technique must be mastered in the same manor
and must be applied in the same way.
The Inter-Collegiate Outing Cub Association, Like the NSS, is an
organization of coordination, IOCA!S rules are simpler and it has
no constitution. Its purpose is to coordinate the activities of
college clubs which deal with any activity of the great outdoors.
Those activities include; climbing, hiking, skiing, caving, eto, etc,
etc. This list could go on forever
Through diversification and its large size, IOCA has developed
many fields of outing into a series of techniques of proven worth."
These techniques are not stringently, except in the realm of safety,
because IOCA is an organization of fun and not of science.
The N.S.S. on the other hand is a semi-scientific organization
which functions only in the field of caveing. This specialization has
led to proven techniques in this field which pre unsurpassed by any
others. Yes, the N.S.S. is the unquestioned leder in the field of
caveing. It has pioneeret exploration, conservation, and scientific
studies of all kinds, as well as made the sport of crveing into a
relatively safe and very rewarding hobby,
It has been shown that both of these organizations are very worth-
while and pre leaders in their fields. But the fields are not and
cannot be separated. Each organimation has much to offer the other
one. Both are mainly, to student members, a means of enjoying life in
a mannor which they like. Therefore, there is no reason that I can
see that a person cannot belong to both groups or a club, for that
matter, and benefit from the onnortunities offered by erch.
As chairmon of the B.R.0.0.4. region of 1.0.0.A. and the outgoing
president of the VPI Grotto of the N.S.S., I surely hope that all people
in b√ºtz. organizations will get together and mutually gain from 1..
knowledge and enjoyment of the grcot world of nature.
THE CORRECT TIETHOD OF BEL AYING
by George Fairer
4 belay is to a climber as a parachute is to a pilot. Both are to
be used in the event of an emergency and both must be usedcorrectly to
be effective.
To function properly you, as a belayer, must first be tied into
the rock or cave wall. There is a very good reason for this. You will
do the climber absolutely no good by rapidly following him down the
cliff or pit. Nothing is accomplished by both of you climbing together..
Therefore, you must be anchored to be effective,
The best method of tying in is to tie a bowline on a coil of at
least three turns around your waist, the free end of the coil is then
tied to a piton, bolt , or handy tree. This keeps you in place in spite
of any forces which you may be subjected to.
