we hit stopned us dead, but after much sliding and pushing we finally
made the crest. Two other cars didn't make thot hill. an hour and aia
half later we dragood the cor into Putersburg, thirty miles from the
fieldhouse, and found our first gas station, where all of that extra
gas came from, I don't know. We arrived home at 5.4.m., Monday, havi ng
averaged twenty miles per hour for the trip. I would say that it WAS
a weekend to remember.
Editoris Note: The theft of Coving equipment mentioned above is cert-
ainly a doplorable situation. Individuals who art. capable of such acts
are certainly not the tyne we want to have particinating in a sport where
the safety and frecrom of movement of all depends on the behavior of
each individual. It is staggering to think of the inossible consequences
of one sicup tampering with the equipment of others(e.g. if Mr. Dayis
party had still been in the cave when their ropes were tampered with.)
. It is honed that, for the good of every individual who ever joun-
neys into a cove, the individduals responsible for this theft can be
apprehended...
LET'S TAKE THE BABY BOTTLES 41\Y FROM TIIE BABIES
(CARRY OUT THAT SPENT CARRIDEÃ“b).
' By Gregg Marland."
and Ed Bauer
The problem of disposing of disposing of snent carbide in a cave
has become an ever incrensing one. It had previously been urged that
an effort be made to bury carbide in inconspicuous areas well away from
flowing water. However, this has proved quite inadequrte as this is
not always possible and in many cases sheer la ziness will result in
carbide being dumned most anywhere,
Everyone who has ever been caving can testify to the quantities of
spent Carbide which mar the walls and foors in nearly all Caves, and
can visulize how much more attractive a cave would appear if this mess
were eliminated. Carbide deposits can also prove fatal to cave organisms
Recently many conservationists have suggested that cavers remove
their spent carbide from the cave with them, but no omnletely satis-
factpry has as yet been discovered for transnorting this spent carbide.
After several experiments and extensive usage for a period of -
over six months, we offer what seems to be a completely adequate method
for carrying snent Carbide from a cave.
4 plastic baby bottle which can be purchased in any five and ten
for about thirty cents makes removing carbide a minimum of effort and
the only ad 'ition to the cover's burden is a third container joining the
ones in which carbide and water are carried. (The BALTIMOPE GROTTO
NEWS claims that most Virginia cavers already carry three flasks, so
for those people we recommend a fourth).
This plastic baby bottle has a mouth which is almost identical in
si ze to that of the carbide containing hrlf of a carbide lamn, making
the transfer a simple task. These bottles are indestructible and the
transfer of spent c-rbide can be accomnlished in any situation.
4 Warning against the use of glass bottles seems aprropriate at
this time. Under no circumstance is the use of glass containers in
caves to be advocated as the great nossibility of breakage is ever
present.
Because, spent carbide is usually still reacting to so me degree,
tests using fresh carbide and water were conducted to find the best
way of relieving the pressure.
It was found that the nipple alone will not allow the escone of
sufficient pressure. Horrever, merely leaving the top partially loosened
does allow enough gas to escape. This is imnortont, for the cap should
