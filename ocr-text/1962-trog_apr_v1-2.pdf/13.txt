NEVER BE TIGHTENED, and if it is, we offer our condolences to the caver
who was carrying this in his back pocket, : 'It has been shown that one
half turn short of fully tightenid is sufficient, but it is suggested
that each person should periodically check his bottle to make sure that
pressure is not building up, for the first time that he tries this met-

... In use by several.members of the VPI Cave Club for over six months
this procedure has yet to prove inadequate for any situation in over
300 hours of apnlic.tion:
· In conclusion; we feel that this is a proven and effective way for
removing spent carbide, that it would help preserve the natural beauty
of all caves if strictly adhered to, and that it should be advocated in

THE NSS NEWS AND MORE
By Ed Bauer
:
.
'I recently heard, while accompanying a' group of neophytes through
a cave, one of them ask one of my fellow grotto members what the NSS
was and what it had to offer. Not being a society member himself, my
friend could come up with no good answer other than the NSS put out
a monthly puplication called the NEWS. The neophyte could not believe
that for $5 or $7 per year he would receive only twelve issues of a
thin journal, But how could he think differently? My friend certainly
knew of no other benefits of the NSS and probably for this reason is
not a member himself. It is regrettable that so many cavers are not
acquainted with the benefits of a : NSS membership,
The other day, having nothing better to do in English class than to
take noteson the life cf Shakespeare, I jotted down the following
items which I think that membership in the NSS has provided and will
continue to provide to its members
Publications: The NSS NEWS.. a monthly puplicätion appealing mainly
to society members and containing articles of general caving interest,
The Bulletin - more appealing to the speleologist but yery educational
to the spelunker; semi-yearly.
Organization; Without national, regional, and grotto organization,
cavers from one area would have very little opportunity to become aca
quainted with the activities of others. Grottoes are set up and a sta-
ble area program is insured for the years to come.
Regional Activities: projects and conferences are held where .items
of regional interest are discussed and carried out,
National Convention: a vacation holiday in good cave country;
lectures, demonstrations, photo salon, caving, Congress of Grottoes,
banquet, etc,
Cave Files: information from all locations stored systematically
in one central location,
Cave Library: contains almost all of the literature ever published
on spelunking, speleology, and other related subjects; literature lent
out at a very minimal fee,
Sadety Practices are stimulated by Safety Chairman and his commit-
tee, Cave search and rescue programs set upa
Organized intelligent group:A group of this size and containing
such a variety of educated people is taken as an authority on many
cave related subjects by governments and other large groups. Only a.
well informed organized group can expect to be recognized in such
matters as cave conservation and commercial exploitation, Exploration,
such as in National Parks and on government is usually available only
to organized groups such as the NSS.
