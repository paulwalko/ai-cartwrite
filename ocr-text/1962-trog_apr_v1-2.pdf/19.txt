and coordinate trips other than caying for the cavers who wanted an
occasional diversification. In this case the club would rema in exclu-
sively for cavers but would offer a diversity of activities for those
who were interested,
In the third cose the club's primary affiliation whould be with
the N.c.5., which seems to us to be a more profitable relationship,
offering something beyond the college level, mature and educated leader-
ship, an opportunity to learn and narticipate in scientific studies,
and nationwide followship, (see "THE N.S.S. ŅEWS 1N? MORE" in this
issue)
In brief, we should either rem in primarily a cave club and hold
the 1.0.9.4. Activities as secondary, or change to an outing club and
make our activities available to those on camnus who are interested in
gome outings but not coving.
It is up to the membership what will be done, but it is evident
that something must be done. (it is honed that the results of the
election held since this article was written and read have been indicat-
ive of the desires of the membership on this matter.)

OUR ROLE IN 1.0.0.A.
by Mike Rosenheimer
A recent rhubarb concerning the role of VPI in 1.0.0.Ay needs some
clarification. The following one will be extremely biaseda?
In this remote corner of the world, the clubs that VPI will be most
able to work with are those within no more than six or eight hours
drive. This does not mean that we cannot gain from the friendship of
those who are more distant, but rother that we are able to do our cave.
ing and climbing, etc., chiefly with those within our own neighborhood,
At the last Virginia region (N.S.S.) conference held at Charlot-
tesville last November, we, the student grottoes, were expressly
charged (by Bill Stephenson) with the "spreading of the pursuit of
Caving" (not a dire E quote) to college-ged people. Two student grottoes
were present-- U.Va, and VPI. The contrast between the tw?, both in
outlook and in individual success, was extreme. The U.Va. Cave Club,
host of the affair, turned out two or three neonle. I am told that
their club numbers less than a dozen cavers. In competition is a
similarly anemic outing Club. VFI was represented by annroximately 15
people, The club cou?d then renort that it was definately growing.
Not mentioned, but still true was the fact that we included under one-
banner all the outing activities desired by the membership. Still
true and still growing.
An examination of the 1.0.0.4. Southern Region is similarly revel-
ing. Of the seven clubs in the region (American, Mary Washington, U.
Va, outing (117?, VPI, U.T.C., Duke, N.c.state), two (American and N.C.
state) may be insidered of only minor size. This is no insult to them;
it just ta pnens to be true. According to its own members, U.Va. 0.0.
is getting yet weaker.
Duke rarely gets far enough out of their shell to be of much in-
fluence, though I am told that their potential is large. This leaves
three strong clubs whose total membershin is about 120 people. Two of
the three clubs have shown that while they intend to remain diversified,
their main interest is underground. The girls from Mary Washington
are quite frankly, willing to try it too.
In combination, those two analyses appear to demonstrate that
