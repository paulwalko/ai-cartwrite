Hello cave,
you old hole in the ground i
To explore you I crave,
to look around i .**.*** .........
Away from the woild,
youire down there alone.
Because your beautyis unspoiled,
itis into your dopths I'm goan. .
I've got my hardhat, .'
and I've got my light.
With the agility of a cat,
I'll search with all my might
for cave yet unexplored, .
where all the formations are stored.
Illl. search for portions to vandals unknown,
where the seeds of destruction have not yet been sown.
And when at last I find this freak.
it will be my turn destruction to wrca,
I'll clash and I'll batter,
the formations to shatter,
They'll conic down with a bang,
and at last 1'll be one of the cause
I hope this little poem
has really hit hoem.
And to all those that say "AW E W22",
If the shoe fits, put it one

TRIP REPORT:
THE CROTTO
Ea Bauor
At first I hesitate to write up a trip report on this particular
cave for fear that I will be criticized for violating a basic rule of
cave safety: a minimum of threc cavers shall explore together. To make
matters worse, the neophyte who was accompanying me was not dressed
in the proper caver's attire; that is to say she was wearing a
straight skirt and heels.
