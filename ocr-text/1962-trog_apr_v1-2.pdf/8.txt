The reason that I was originally attracted to, this particular i
was that I saw it. advertised somewhere as "New York City's only cave
restaurant". About the only feature of this place which at all re-
minded me of a natural cave was the chill in the air. (New York was
experiencing a cold spell at the time and the furnace was on the blink):
Once seated I had the feeling that I was eating an Italian dinner
while sitting in the middle of a coal mine. The black walls, and we'il-
ing were indeed interesting, geologically speaking, as were the num-
erous chianti bottles which seemed to grow from them. As I paid the
tab, I came to the realization that the "Grotto" was actually a high
priced after theatre restaurant, using the cavern novelty, and
certainly not the type of eating establishment in which cavers are
usually found. While I can not recommend the. "Grotto" , its-locating
coordinates follow for all those interested: 224. West 46th Sto;
Now York City, New York.

Alter becoming one of those rare trips that actually gets off at
the standard departure time of 1:00 PM(.We were scheduled to leave at
12:30) our group of nine headed for Monroe County, West Virginia to
spend the March 31 - April 1 weekend seeing some of those big hor- .
izontal caves we had heard 'so much abouta letrlie Bladen, Dave Rice,
Bonnie Stephenson and myself rode with Court Warfield while Ed Bauer,
B:31 Lipscomb, and Iob Mallis risked their lives in Ed Day's yellow
bomba
Heading first for Haynes Cave, which none of us knew quite.how to
find, with yours cruely handling the mars, we twice iissed our turn
and had to turn around, but eventuall-y-arrived-on-ene of those roads
that just wasn't built for Valiants with five passengers and camping
gear. Finally it got to the point where out noblo pilot, Mr. Warfield,
announced that whether or not the map creou, we were there, Briefly
eyeing the country sido knowladgably, as soineone is lost but won't
admit it, I soon headed toward the nealest house with Dave and Charlie,
Silco none of the ghosts there knew the cave is location, we headed for
tne next house, which, as is usually the case, was two hills away.
The woman there did know about the cave and turned out to be one o:f ...
those rare individuals who is able to give directions that can actual-
ly be followed, Haynes Cave does, it seems, have another name by
which it is known to the local people. So, following her directions,
we headed for Nickell Cave.
Heading down behind the first house where Bauer took time to admirÃ«
the lightning rods and comment on the advantages of owning such
items while telling certain types of jokes, we followed the fence
along the back of the house, through thn orchard, and soon found the
entrance. Descending the wooden stairs we by-stepped a dead fox amid
a flurry of cracks about rabies and automobile ornaments.
The first portion of the cave was very Wet and we soon passed a
wooden trough which had been covered with dripstone, Soon afterward
we passed into dry dusty cave and like this it remained for the rest
of the tripo
Extensive and elaborate wooden bridges span shallow pits, and
troughs and other relics which have been marvolously preserved for
these one hundred years since the cave was mined for saltpeter are
everywhere in evidence, Inscriptions on the walls, both scratched and
burned, were seen dating back into the twenties and a guest register
at the back of the cave contained equally old notations. The earliest
