of our knowledge of the cave were not mentioned. Others, whose contri-
butions have been slight, were mentioned in detail. A part of this
can be explained by the natural desire to mention VPI and other cavers
known to his readers. For examnle, Bill Cuddingtonis contribution on
that one trip, while im rescivo in the face of the difficulties he en-
countered, did little to aid the overall project, Bill would be the
first to admit this. The entrance to cuddington Canyon that he first
forced, is in fact, so difficult and potentially dangerois, that an
alternative, still quite difficult entrance was blasted onen.
The third entrance was constructed by a combination of digging
and blasting from the surface by Mr, Cutliff (based on surveys), and
from below by Koy, Sonnott and Merrill. The total expenditure of
dynamite, surface and subsurface was 75 stic's, of which the 36 were
subsurface,
Soveral of the features so dramatically described have and to be
redone (Ten Second Canyon, VPI Traverse etc.) simply because of the
refusal of the initial party to add these valuable areas to the map.
While the accomplishment of the VPI team in crossing the Traverse
(which, thank God abounds in hand-holas), was impressive, many other
equally difficult and challenging technical nroblems were not inentioned.
Some of these might include: jennott's crossing of torty-athom Fit,
crossing the Virgin fit, the descent of Moe Domepit and the crossing
of Mud Domenit,
Many of Larry's facts and figures are "removed" from our corres-
pondence, in fact several features shown on the mop reflect this to
ä high degree- to my knowledge Larry has not soen several of them. It
is in regard to this map however that my most severe protest lies. I
began the James napning project in barly 1959, and it has been largely
through ny efforts th2at the project has been kept alive. Although a
great many peonle have made valuable contributions, large and small
to the map, at no time was Larry one of thom, on one occasion he
assisted me for about 400 feet of taping, his only contribution to the
map, at all other times he categorically refused to give any assist-
ance. The map which he reproduced is a tracing of the crude, scale
sketch that I prepared tw.) years ago, with the addition of suplemen-
tary information on new surveys that I sent him as they were completed.
A certain amount of twisting and compression was necessary to get the
map to "fit" an eight by ton page,
Larry and I have had frequent disagreements on matters of nolicy
and ethics. This lotest tactic, trking the work of others and publish-
ing it under his name without nermission, and with, at best the infer-
ence that it is l-rgely his, is certainly a case of very por jưdze-
ment indeed. In some circles 4 far less comnlimentary term is annlied
to such poor judgement.
This letter did not stem from any great desire to see iny name in
print. quite the contrary, I would rather not have seen James Cave
mentioned at all, and especiəlly not in this rather distorted licht.
Representing the people to whom this work rightfully belongs, I must
protest this treatment of our cave and use

Editor's Note: A letter adressed to Goorge Fairer from Saro Corrie
expressed similer but somewhat less detailed criticism of this same
article, Mrs. Corriers comments were extremely harsh and indicated
that Mr, Griffin had intentionally attempted to discredit others who
were significant in the exploration of James Cave. She said in part
