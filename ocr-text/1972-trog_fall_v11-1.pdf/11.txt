THE TECY TROGLODYTE

These early months are most critical for the bat, Upon
waking it is thin and wealt. Indeed, many niscalculato". their
fcservo and never do waken' In their weakness, they often fail to
the ground unable to fly where they perish helplessly and are often
devoured by cave beetles. The first spring nights are also unpre-
dictable, In their desperate search for food it is often that bats
are caught off guard only to die of exposure.
For as long as twenty yoars bats nust proceed through the
complexities and dangers of hibernation. With the pain of flight
and therefore the increased body surface area, they forfeit most of
their lives to hanging dormantly in dead dow position in clark
and moist chambers.
The problem of thermal control and dohydration governs the batis
entire life. It can even be argued that their nocturnal existance
is solely the product of the needs of their small bodies. At night
the temperatures cool and humidity is relatively higher than during
the day. Flying insects are also more abundant during the evening.
but not so much as to be the entire cause of their night flights.
After all, not all bats eat insects.
It is because of the aspects of hibernation as a primitive
intermediate trait, the extrenities of thethernal problems and
the complex adaptions made as a result that keep growing interest
in bat hibernation. To date study has been difficult, but with
new advances in field equipment and techniques more light is being
shed on the internal workings of this strange mechanism.
