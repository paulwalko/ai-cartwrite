performance. Tom Roehr was also a winner by his tying of a bowline
(backed off with two half hitches) in a little over three seconds.
Incredible! I suppose this kind of thing could be really useful if
you wanted to escape the clutches of a threatening cave monster, the
Mafia, the fuzz or some malevolent companion.
... Believe it or not, there is a paper published called "A Pre-
liminary Checklist of Cave Monsters" compiled by David N. Brison.
The introduction reads as follows: "This is the first known attempt
at a systematic classification of cave monsters, both inorganic and
organic. The list includes only the most commonly known cave monsters
which have been described and exhibited in science fiction and horror
motion pictures from the turn of the century to the present." Such
organisms as slobbus soapus, Lagoonus patheticus, Bubbleheadis
humpibackis are just an example of those identified. You're weird
David N. Brison, really weird.
... A complimentary pamphlet entitled "A Guide to Safe Caving -
Rules and Courtesies was picked up at Atlas Sport Store in D.C.
this summer. Put out in 1967 by the Speleological Society of America,
this particular pamphlet is #1 in the "Cavers Training Series". If
anyone could get ahold of the entire series, it would be an inter-
esting addition to the Grotto files.
... Most people who frequent the outdoors find that goose down
clothing and bags are a must. After much use the article gets filthy
and romains that way or is cleaned. How does one clean a down bag
or jacket? Handwashing in warm water with Woolite or Ivory Flakes
(not a detergent containing 'down-damaging alkalai) will clean the
nylon and also the down. The article should be gently -kneaded so the
suds are worked through. Rinsing should be in clear water until all
the soap is gone. Bo very careful handling a sleeping bag that is
heavy with water, for the down will avalanche" like snow through
the baffling and is nearly impossible to repair. For drying, after
the water has been pushed out, the article may be tumble dried at
Low temperature. Weather permitting, a bag should be hung outside
to finish the drying. Fluff well afterwards to restore the loft.
Drying should be as soon as possible after washing, because wet
down will bunch up permanently. Down clothing can be dry-cleaned,
but only by a dry cleaners who know about various cleaning fluids
that will not harm natural protein substances. Sounds like a lot of
work, but enough dirt particles can accura late after about 30 to 45
nights of use to reduce the quality of loft in your down bag.
...It has been rumored that a publication called The Tech
Proctoscope will be coming out soon. Seems that we've been hearing
that one for the last eight months. When the Ass. Editor was asked
about the nature of the publication, all he replied was, â€œFilth,
pure filth.6
...Did you know that there is an Ed Loud Memorial Toilet in
Bangkok, Thailand ?
