THE TECH TROGLODYTE
CAVING IN THE CANADIAN ROCKIES
There we sat, almost 1130 feet below the entrance of
Yorkshire Pot, Canada. Three cavers grinned at each other over
the successful decent. Vow we had to start thinking about the
long haul out to daylight.
Our situation actually was the fruit of some very wishful
thinking over a year before. iy long time caving companion, Bob
Vocke, was visiting Blacksburg for the 1971 NSS Convention.
Here we first learned of the fantastic caving activities in the
Canadian Rockies, Dr. Derek Ford had given a fine presentation
of caving activities there during the convention. But The Real
eye-catcher was an issue of the Canadian Caver that Bob and I saw
in publications sales. Crowsnest Pass, 1ocated on the Pricish-
Columbia-ilberta border is the site of one of Canada's premier
caving areas.
The main attraction thore, at least to us, was the Yorkshire
Pot. Located at about 8,000 feet elevation, the cave descends 1130
feet to a sump. The deepness and location of the cave contributed
to the thouglıts of a visit to the area. The opportunity material-
ized sooner than we had hoped, for the following sumner I found
myself at Bob's place in Seattle, iy summer long visit was to
coincide with the 1972 SS Convention in white Salmon as well as
see some Lava Tubes, do some backpacking, and conquer sone of those
majestic mountains. Put certainly the planned caving adventure to
Crowsnest Pass loomed bis to us.
Dave tischke, also of Seattle, joined us, and by the time I
had arrived in Seattle in June, Dave had already been in touch
with Canadian cavers and had secured detailed directions to tie area
and Yorkshire Pot. In addition, Dave attended the northwost Region
meeting held in Vanccuver, 7.C. cver the Fourth of July 2 nd and
received topo raps of the area. We had directions; we ::..:;-power
(but bera ); we had enough tackle; we needed transporiaci06. The
selection was simple. Trogil say 4 by 4 Nissan Patrol was a landslide
winner over Dave's Cortina and Bob's Corolla, e set ugust 1 as

Three hours later. We pulled on the road to a roadside rest
near the col::ria Ricer and sackeü cut. An early start the next
morning onabled us to reach Crowsnest Pass. After a bit of difficulty
ve found the old seismic road which follows Ptolemy Creek upstream.
