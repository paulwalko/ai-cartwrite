Where do we go from horo?
I'vo hoard a lot of talk lately that one of the reasons that the
Virginia Region is like one big grotto is because, as far as cavo
mapping is concerned in the state, there's just not that much more
left to do. Consequently, Region activities, according to this hy-
pothesis, have becoin imore socially and if politically oriented. It
is true that the Region seems more closely knit than I can ever remem-
ber. Fantastic - for the fellowship of caving is part of what makes
it so great, We're now lucky to be living in an era of Region unity.
I'd like to add that we can, by the way, boast of one of the most out-
standing caving publications in the country.
But don't give up hope. on unexplored areas in caving either.
Why can't wo have things doubly good? Jaybe essentially all of the
huge known caves in the area have been mapped, but there are still
many unopened doors yet to be discovered right under our noses.
Virgin passage was just found in Sick e Hole a few weeks ago, who
knows just how long that cave really is? Log Holo turned out to have
much more passage than was previously reported/and Mark Slusarski and
Till Douty have recently found several new caves in the Yewport area.
Farther in the Southwest, a few years ago Perkin's Cave was thought
to be a thousand foot, vandalized'cave. Today, it is second largest
in the state with some of the finest formations, all because Tom
Roehr and John Katon decided to push a proviously untouched crawl.way.
And look at the club's Fall Project, Several cavos were mapped and
many new caves were discovered in Smyth County, just an hour and a
half drive away.
The cavers of the 1500s should be given ilot of credit for
all the caves they mapped, but they just didn't have the time to
check all the loads thoroughly. If you want to find virgin passage
to explore or to map, just look up some of the "small"unvisited caves
in the files or in Caves of Virginia. Go out and check all leads and
you should find some that probably never been explored. Also,
there's no reason why one shouldn't map some of the small but inter-
osting caves around here, especially if you're not an old hand at
mapping. A short cave would not be time consuming, yet good experience,
There are also othor areas of interest other than surveying, such
as geology, biology, anthropology, paleontology and many others.
You don't have to want to add anything more academic to your college
lifo nor must you be well-versed ospecially in any of the above areas.
Rather, you may just enjoy discovering some prehistoric mastodon skel-
oton, or Indian burial place or new species of something, and than
turn the discovery over to a moro qualified person to work on.
Don't forget UVACS,eithor. Lewisburg is only an hour and a half
drive from here and they still need people to help them. And, of course,
if you're new to caving, the known and well-traveled caves in the area
are still exciting to explore.
