12ARE PEACE WITH GOD" (OR ELSE)
Outside of Hell Hole Cave in Pendelton County, West Virginia,
is a weather worn sign that has a humorous or prophetic message,
depending on the caver, or perhaps the day, on this occasion the
message, read so many times before, sooned humorous at first but
perhaps a hint of warning vas implied - the message: make Peace
with God. Thus the Hell Hole trip of October 21 seemed humorous,
but perhaps there is a hint...
This Hell sole trip began as a planned combined attack to see
how many people could enter the cave at one time. The preparation
was fantastic. Anybody that was anybody was there. There was Gold
line, Elue jater, phone cable, Anything that could be rigged was
rigged. Unfortunately, there are only three holes at Hell Hole so
only six ropes could be tied in at one time. So that no one would
get stuck, no knots were put in the ends of any of the ropes,
There were all types of fantastic rappels. One fellow did a mar-
velous singles rappel without the help of any gloves, another did
a leg wrap with the rope that he wasn't clipped into and still
another rappeled on a rack with only one bralce bar on - all with-
out belay. The effect from belou was magnificent, There were bodies
dropping everywhere and the falling rocks made an impressive sound in
the open entrance.
After the multitude of bodies finished the entrance. (in a record
time of two hours) the groups split up. Two parties were mapping,
one party gating, and another party just visiting. The gating party
was to gate the ew Section to save the beautiful formations, and to
protect the dying bat population. So it was that the two mapping
parties, and the visiting party tromped past the soon-to-be gate
and headed for the fragile back section. With close comradship
that cavers often show, the trips split up only to end up hours
later in the same room where the brunton reader of one survey party
was given the narvelous selection of sixteen different lights-on-
station. After a few games of catch me - I forgot how to rappel"
and how do you get out of here in the groups (save the two brave cavers
who were still exploring) made their ways back to the entrance to
admire the six ropes.
The variey of ascending gear used vas as fabulous as the meth-
ods of descent. There were cans, jumars, knots and all asortnents
of slings, wraps, clips , buckles and snaps. Anything that has ever
been conceived of touching a rope was there, Some people climbed
fast, Somo people barely climbed, some hung way back and others hung
upside down. Finally after everybody got a chance to play with a
rope, except the two brave cavers (the trip leader and a friend) the
clind was completed in a record three hours.
A memorable trip, an exciting excursion - a good time was had by
all, even the bats who awoke from hibernation to participate in the
fun and festivities.
