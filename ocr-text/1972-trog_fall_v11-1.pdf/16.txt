TALL
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1972-*
On long trips, drinking water and lots of goodies should be around,
Fint cakes, mincemeat, sardines, tropical chocolate, dried fruit
and homemade istrail foods' to mention a few, perk up any.- caving
trip. Candy that contains nostly dextrose supposedly converts to
quick energy faster than most sugars.
I suppose this article makes winter caving sound dreadful and
to be avoided at all costs, but if you use some common sense and a
little preparation then forgo the much more dangerous sport of skiing
and go caving instead,
