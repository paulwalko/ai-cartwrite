Bats successfully brought into hibernation in the laboratory have
been placed in temperatures as low as twentyeight degrees Fahrenheit
with the body temperature of the bat being only two degrees higher ,
The bats recovered with no ill effects. (Allen, 1967:273) At this
temperature the moisture within the wing membrane begins to crys-
tallize and at any lower temperature the lungs will also be affected,
resulting in death in about twenty minutes.
Although it is true that during hibernation bats are cold,
stiff and unresponsive, they are at the sane time extremely sensi-
tive to changes in the outside environment. Any disturbance (such
as clumsy cavers) will quickly cause irreversible awakening and the
loss of ten equivalent hibernating days worth of fat reserve. Al-
though once again able to return into hibernation after awakening,
too many disturbances can have a detrimental effect on the bat.
Rats do not, however, remain totally stationary during their periods
of sleep. It has been shown that with such species as the social
bat, movement takes place as often as once a week. It is thought
that these movement patterns are in response mainly to thirst, for
much water is lost through the ear and wing membranes, Expansion of
the urinary bladder could also have effect. These movements be-
come increasingly frequent as fat reserves continue to shrink at a
stepped up rate, (noore, 1964:278)
A bat, during the winter, may lose as much as one third of its
original body weight. In November, fat reserves make up as much
as nineteen and a half percent of the bat's total weight. PÅ‚y Feb-
ruary this has dropped to fifteen percent, mid March to'tan percent,
and by lato April a. little over five percent. (Allen, 1967:278)
The complete awakening period usually begins in March, but is
very gradual and is not final until early June, Arousal from sleep,
however, takes only ten to fifteen minutes and is accomplished in
four generalized and continuous stages. (Allen, 1967,279) The first
is the stage of complete dormancy where the bat is rigid and unres-
ponsive. From here very slight reflexes are observed as the body
temperature increases at a rate of two degrees per minute. Each leg
is extended slowly, one at a time and the bat begins to shiver,
This stage is directed mainly by the medulla oblongata area of the
brain. The third stage is marked by the functioning of the fore.
brain, Shivering is more intense, Sounds are muttered and more
active responses in general are observed. The fourch and final stage
is that when the bat is fully awake, The body teraperature has risen
above eighty five degrees Fahrerheit and the bat is able to fly.
In iarch, when fully aroused, the bats drink ravenously. They
then begin to frequent the cave entrance and on warmer nights fly
out in search of early spring insects. The bats will return, hove
ever, and continue to hibernate for short periods between the test-
ing of outside conditions, until they can safely leave toward early
June,
