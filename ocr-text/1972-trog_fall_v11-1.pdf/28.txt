that rat hole was enough. Cleft Cave , whose entrance is located
high on the northeast wall of the cirque containing Ptolemy Creek
Flateau, was our next objective. A quick rescent from the col
brought us to Ptolemy Plateau where we began the arduous ascent to
the cave, The 60 foot high by 10 foot wide entrance is easily
visible from the valley floor. The 700 foot climb from the plateau
is all in loose scree with a small cliff half way up, The climb,
followed by a traverse along scree-covered top of another cliff
directly beneath the cirque headvall, brought us to the spectacular
entrance. By this time ny electronic flash had lost all its juice,
This was unfortunate because beautiful hoar frost ice crystals
adorned the passageways. The cave, located near a syncline, has a
second entrance, e soon came to this lofty perch overlooking the
north cirque of Ptolemy Creek, and about 900 feet above the valley
floor. Retracing our steps back through the mountain brought us
out. Deciding to climb the cirque headwall and short cut over the
mountain brought us skidding through scree to camp and Dave just
before nightfall. The Bleuet lantern again proved its worth as
we cooked supper after dark.
The seventh day of August brought our stay to a close as we
packed up. Grossly unwieldy loads made for three sore bodies when
we reached Trog, on the way down the stopped on Ptolemy Plateau and
explored Ptolemy Cavo, a multi-entrance-skylight cave of little con-
sequence, to also met a group of Canadians on their way up to
study the karst features, Included in the group was a former
member of the VFI Cave Club, Jim Quinlan, its president in 1959,
We then four-wheeled out and headed south to Idaho for the ISS pre-
convention field trips to Papoose: Cave.
The Ptolemy Creek area proved to be all wo had anticipated
and more. The exquisite alpine scenery offers a spectacular stee ing,
and the cavos are most interesting. hat a.pleasant change fron New
River Cavo!
