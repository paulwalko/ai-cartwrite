Most research on bat hibernation in the past has been done by
naturalists and physiologists using traditional European field ob-
servat cry procedure. This is mainly for reasons of great limitations
imposed on actual laboratory work. As two examples it is found
that bats do not respond well to captivity and it is extremely dif-
ficult to duplicate the correct environment necessary for hibernation.
It is for such reasons that not much is known about the deep phys-
iological aspects of hibernation but, in any case, 'many interesting
points have been noted.
Throughout the warm summer nights bats must gradually gorge
themselves with insects in preparation for the coming six month
hibernation period. This appoars to be a very systematic process,
for a last ininute feast will not suffice, Dats in some innate
manner must calculate the needed fat reserve and rate of depletion
for the dormant period. It is estimated that bats eat an average
of half their weight nightly. As a startling example of this (although
of a non-hibernating species) it has been calculated that the mexican
free-tailed bat population of the southwestern United States eats
about 100,000 tons of insects each year, (loore, 1964:82)
Although it is not fully understood how bats begin to hiber-
nate, the process is known to be gradual. It comes with the absence
of food in late autumn when the temperature does not rise above
fifty to fifty-four degrees Fahrenheit. (Allen, 1967:273) Also
noteworthy is the fact that mating occurs during this period. It
has only been recently found that in some species fertilization
takes place immediately while embryonic developinent is slowed during
hibernation. In others fertilization is delayed until spring as
the sperm are stored within the female during hibernation: Birth
of the young takes place in late Juna.
As the temperature reaches the mid-forties bats must seek
shelter. In finding a suitable location for hibernation, the dif-
ferent species of bats are particularly selective. It seems that
in this task each species searches out the coldest environment
which it can tolerate. This cf course is not the only factor in.
volved. Huinidity, darkness and amount of draft also play a great
role,
Although some such species as the red bat(Lasiurus borealis)
find quarters on the outside, little sheltered from the extremities
of winter, most are seen to prefer caves. Humidity is constantly
high along with a constant temperature, darkness and relatively
little draft. Here, many species distribute themselves as to their
particular needs. In Table 1 a few common eastern species of bats
are compared as to their individual peculiarities in location of
hibernation within caves.
