FALL
THE TECH TROGLODYTI
1972
,
... Over the years The Tech Troglodyte has met with considerable
foul-ups and resulting confusion in the numbering system of the vol-
umes. It's quite confusing to us, so heaven help others, cover
misprintings, mistakes passed on and failure to even print are the
contributing factors. The following is a carefully researched list
of what actually exists. The period between 1966 and 1970 is where
the mistakes lie, and other issues preceeding and following this
period are accurate. First is listed the volume and number as it
appears on the cover and then, in parentheses, is what the correct
volume and number should be. (F=Fall, W=Winter, S=Spring)

Notice that the volumes are numbered according to the school year
and not the calender year. Hopefully in the future no quarter will
be Trog-less (simply because it's easier and less confusing). In the
event that a summer-school issue comes out, it will be designated as
#4. We hope that this has made things more clear and we apologize
for the inconviences.
