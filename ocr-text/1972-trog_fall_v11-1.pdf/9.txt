It is seen that there is a direct correlation between the size
of the bat and that particular environment which it chooses. Vhy
only some bats have chosen social quarters and others not, is poorly
understood. It is probably for reasons of heat conservation and water
loss that some species cluster, thus limiting the surface area ex-
posed, However, many others such as the eastern pipistrelle are ex-
tremcmely solitary. In any case, the microclimate that the bat finally
chooses must nect that individual's exact requirements. If it should
change during hibernation the bat will awaken and move to better
surroundings. This microclimate is so exact that one can often pra-
dict the environnental faciors of the area simply by oeserving the
bats which inhabit it, (mohr, 1966:52)
Cnce having found a suitable location it takes, on the average,
one to two hours for the bat to enter a state of hibernation,
During this process metabolism slows down to an alarmingly slow
rate, Digestion ceases as the bat begins living off of fat accun-
ulation. Heart rate becomes almost imperceivable and breathing
slows to as low a rate as one breath every three minutes. This is
as low as one percent of normal breathing rate. (noore, 1964:82)
During hibernation a bat can live more than an hour iſ totally de-
prived of Oxygen. An interesting mechanism controlling this seemingly
automatic reduction of respiration is found at the onset of hiberna-
tion when a thick lining of mucus is seen to almost totally restrict
air passage through the larynx and windpipe. (Allen, 1967:277)
This also serves to help lessen the rate of dehydration through
breath vapors. Along with the general metabolic decline there is
a great reduction in body temperature from about one hundred and four
degrees Fahrenheit when active, to almost that of the cave itself,
