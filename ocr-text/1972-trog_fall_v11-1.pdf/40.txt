THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1972
... Last Spring an article entitled "Everything You Always Wanted
to Know About Plastic Carbide Lamps" appeared in the Troglodyte (V.X#3)
as well as the Potomac Caver and the NSS News. A copy of it was
sent to the Justrite company by the author and received a reply not
long after. The following is essentially the company's position
and their efforts to solve the problem(s).
1. Justrite is very much interested in re taining their carbide
lamp market.
2. They have made several modifications to the original plastic
design in attempts to improve it:
a. Bumps on water dropper (good)
b. Smooth water plug (poor)
c. Wad of felt in gas tube (poor)
d. Finer sponge filter (good)
e. Stronger filter clip (good)
f. Round tip instead of hex-tip (absurd ! )
8. Stronger nylon bracket (good)
h. No wind protector included (copping out on melt-out problem)
1. Bottom made of apparently higher temerature plastic (good)
They retain though:
a. The fundamentally unsound water-tank-inside-base design,
b. The awkward hex-nut reflector retainer.
C. The untethered water plug.
d. And the too loose water valve adjustment.
4. Research and modification are continuing.
The company sent the author a couple of sample models, but he
said that he hasn't gone into any dinky enough caves lately to try
them out. He feels that Jus trite should be encouraged to redesign
the lamp for greater effectiveness and reliability..
3.
no. The Pittsburgh Grotto is making a big to-do about how the
Virginia Region (the . Avant.- Garde Region) doesn't want to extend its
geographical boundries to dmit then. They cave in West Virginia (but
so do a lot of others), but will they be willing to be represented
at Region meetings and projects, some as far as Tennessee, and fork
out bread for Region affiliations? Besides, how do we know what
kind of streakers they are?
... If you haven't subscribed to the Region Record yet, then
you ought to soon, before you miss another fantastic issue. It's the
opinion of most and the concession of some that it's the best caving
publication in the country, $3 yearly sent to Box 3585 CRS,
Johnson City, Tennessee 37601 will get a positive response.
... This summer every grotto received a letter from Paul Broughton
requesting samples, small, but nonetheless samples, of cave formations
for a "legitimate scientific research project. This was met with
a degree of protest from the NSS. Well, Paul's done it now, because
he sent the request to a magazine called Mineralogical Record (V.3,
#3, Sept.-Oct, 1972), which is not a scientific journal, but is de-
signed for mineral collectors, And as we all know, mineral collectors
are the greatest scourge of efforts of cave conservation. Cavers are
encouraged to voice their opinions to Mr. Broughton at the following
address: Subsurface Geological Laboratory, 201 Dewdney Ave., E.,
Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada.
