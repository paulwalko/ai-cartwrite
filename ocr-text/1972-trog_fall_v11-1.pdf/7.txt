THE HIBERNATION OF BATS
Animal life and low temperatures have never proven to coincide
in great harmony. The survival of animals demands heat in order for
vital bio-chemical reactions to take place. It is because of this
that evolution has continually selected for those better adapted for
meeting this problem of countering the cold. Perhaps the greatest
advances thus made are seen with the birds and mammals, which include
the evolution of insulating hair, feathers and fatty tissues, of
thermo controlling capillaries and of that general state known
as homiothermy, or warm bloodedness. These characteristics, how-
ever, do not totally solve the homiotherms heat problem. As an ex-
ample, the first evolving group of namals were quite small, some
leading the way to the somewhat more primitive small mannmalian groups
of today. Although truly homoj.othermic, these mammals share a
common problem which larger mammals do not. Their body.volume to
surface ratio is extremely small, making it quite difficult for them
to maintain the constant high temperature necessary during cold
weather. Not only does the metabolic rate have to increase exponont-
ially, but food is usually lou during these periods. To demonstrate
the seriousness of this problem, it is seen that some shrews which
weigh as little as four ! grams ' will die within a few hours if
deprived of food,
In adapting to the situation the smaller homoiothers have taken
two main courses of action; that of migration to a warmer climate
and that of hibernation. (vohr, 1966:52) The birds seem to have
taken migration as their sole means of escape, although a type of
hibernation is known to occur in a few species of humming birds.
In mammals, however, specifically bats, it seems that migration was
later to evolve since these hibernating mammals are also known to
migrate in search of food throughout their active periods, Banding
procedures have shown some species to migrate as far as eight
hundred miles during the summer, only to return always to the same
location in the fall to hibernate, (mohr, 1955:226)
of the entire mammalian class there are only three orders in
which true hibernation is known to occur. These include the Rodentia
(rodents), Insectivora (moles and shrews) and Chiroptera (bats).
It is this last order, in particular the family of Vespertillionidea,
that has initiated special interest. Many of these bats not only
hibernate in winter months but, in addition, everyday between active
periods. It is calculated that these sinail creatures spend as much
as five-sixths of their life span of up to twenty years hanging by
their feet in a state of suspended animation. (Allen, 1967:269)
Also of interest is the fact that these animals are especially sus-
coptible to temperature and hunidity changes, Not only are they
small, but in the evolution of naked wings and, in some species,
large ears, their total surface area is multiplied along with the
problems of thermo regulation and dehydration,
