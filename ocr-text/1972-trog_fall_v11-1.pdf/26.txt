THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1972
with a few clouds drifting below and a distant city's lights
twinkling in the distance were a most unforgettable sight in the
mountains of limestone.
The fourth of August arrived with Dave feeling much better.
We concentrated our efforts at the dig. It was a frustrating
experience but we seened to be making some progress since the snow
was getting softer as we dug deeper. Soon the trench had gotten so
deep that we could not fling snow above it: a tunnel vas started.
Then at 2:30 p.m. Bob scrambled excitedly out of the snow. He had
broken through to a cave. Yorkshire Pot, of course. He went back
to camp to dry off while Dave and I enlarged his crawlway to a five
foot high tunnel leading downward into blackness. Our trench-
tunnel complex was over-all about thirty feet long and twenty feet
deep. We sure hoped the cave to be worthy of our digging efforts.
After constructing 12 steps in the snow to ease our egress, I found
myself at the edge of a small drop. We decided to take in a few
ropes and rig some of the pitches.
Yorkshire Pot and the other caves of the area are a direct
result of the Lewis thrust Fault. The main cave bearing limestone
is the highly fossiliferous Livingstone formation, which is over-
thrust to about 1200 feet thick, Caves on the lindy Good Plateau
typically descend almost vertically via structural weakness caused
by this tect√≤nic activity, Yorkshire Pot is one of the few caves
there that has remained unblocked by debris at constictions,
The overall bedrock dipuis at about 30 degrees, but a major fold
occurs near Yorkshire Pot with the cave developed near the axis of
the anticline. All invasion streams flow down dip.*
We finally entered the cave. After descending from the
tricky snow lip, we found ourselves in a vertical sho'ver from snow
melt leaking through the ceiling. The problem is a 12 foot climb
down in the midst of a shower, we all got quite damp! After a bit
of poking into dead ends, we located the right passage and chimneyed
down 30 feet to a narrow canyon. He finally found our selves at the
top of the first pitch that necessitated rigging. We rigged its
56 feet with two cable ladders. This pitch was the wettest as it
was a waterfall. But by rigging carefully at the top, the water was
largely avoided until the bottom 15 feet, A short scramble lead to
the third pitch of 37 feet where we managed to S-t--@-c-h our last
cable ladder. Pob went down and assured us that another pitch
followed directly. The left our remaining ropes at the top of the 37
foot pitch and headed out as we were quite wet and tired even
though we had been in the cave less than four hours. The cold air
and water at about 35-40 degrees 7. called for extra clothing; I
wore fishnet, wool shirt, w001. sweater, wool pants, and coveralls,
Bob and Dave wore similar outfits, Dave wore his ilgupersavers",
a homemade coverall suit of waterproofed nylon. His light source
was handicapped somewhat because he krad forgotten the reflector to
his land. However, he had managed to fashion one out of a tin can.
