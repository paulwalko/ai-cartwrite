...From our Additions and corrections Department, the chords to
the song "Boss Man" from the Songbook on page 6.
D
Boss man, boss man, what do you say,
I gotta get you alone in the mine someday.
Boss man, boss man turn it around,
If you don't look away how can I sit down?

Look at this load upon my back,
Gotta get this wheel back on the track.

I can't hold on but I can't let go,
I can't say yes, I can't say no.

... Last summer more Songbooks were run off and many were sold
at the White Salmon Convention. There are still some around and are
still 75 postpaid. If for some reason you've ordered one and haven't
received it, please let us know, cause we'll make good immediately.
... Hopefully, next quarter we'll get around to putting together
the first Supplement to the Songbook. We're collecting songs and
chords now and anyone sending innovating contributions to the world
of Cavers Singing, will be met with a complimentary copy. They will
be included with the regular issue of the Troglodyte for Winter quar-
ter. The cost for additional Supplements will probably be around
.01 per page + postage,
... Still on the subject of songs - for those of you that don't
know it, there really is a Jack O'Meara, sung of in "The Falcon".
The original fellow who got filled full of lead and wimpered as his
head came off was named Jock O'Leary. After many wild song mests, the
name became corrupted to what we now know it as. For all you squeal-
ing teeny-boppers, Jack shows up at Region functions now and then, but
it would be questionable whether he'd autograph your Songbooks.
... The VPI Grotto has always liked to brag about itself and while
researching the number of man-hours underground for Fall 072, it was
found to be nothing to brag about especially. Someone thence remark-
ed, "Too bad we didn't sign out and write up man-hours spent drinking
at the Pizza Hut, prɔbably twice the caving hours. Wouldn't doubt it,
wouldn't doubt it at all,
..."Stolen: a day-glow caving poster from the decorations of the
dance at Old Timers'. Of a very ferocious cave monster with blazing
eyes and sharp teeth. The possessor of said poster should be warned
that many such cave monsters display an uncanny sense of justice,
of ten with much vigor. de should be cautioned to take care where
and with whom he caves and might do well to carry a BIG stick.at
