WEY RIVER CAVE: REVISITED AGAI
Puey Dale, it has been decided that this is a Ladies Luxilary
trip and we'll let you come . "
Gee, thanks,
So, on a fine warn, beautiful day of November 4, 1972, much
too pretty a day to go underground, Cathy Dancy, Jette Teduska, Jean
McCarthy, Janet Queisser, and Dale Parrott did just that. Dale had
fine and lofty plans for this particular trip. Finish up all
the little things, like complete all the small leads off the Forest
Room and maybe even go on to the Waterfall, if we feel like it.
En route to the cave, discussions of the absolutely remarkable
warm weather we're having and weighing the merits of partying versus
caving as being good for the soul pointed to the prediction that
this would be one of those really harddriving mapping trips.

Finding a place to park was tricky. It seened that a great
portion of the Va tech student body decided to forego the football
game to romp arounc eu River Cave, Preceding the Survey Team was
à troop of Flashlight Cavers looking dressed for a nature walk in the
National Park. The only confrontations occured when the team was met
by a shower of rocks and debris shoved down the steep hillside, for
some unknown reason, by the Junday Cayers. As the members of the VPI
Grotto readied to assult the cave, the other group appeared from the
rocks above and were somewhat apologetic for nearly killing the sur-
veyers.
"Gee, you all are sure prepared, aren't you?'
sYou kinda have to be if you're going to do something other
than throw rocks down a mountain.''
The survey Team headed quickly on to the innards of the cave,
leaving the Flashlight Cavers to their own demise.
Fast the Fallen Hatchet and on up to the Forest Room they went..
If anyone has ever wondered what a beautifully decorated room looks
like after several decades of dedicated vandalism,--he should stop
wondering and visit the Forest Room of Pew River Cave. It makes you
angry, and at the samo time, very sad.
orking their way through the stubby stalagmites, Jette swooned,
is Phalluses, tons of then ! Taking through them! Crawling over them!
Eeek: 9
After Dale finally got everyone calmned down, they began to
survey one of the small leads that had been checked but never mapped.
Jean set stations and scouted ahead, Cathy was load' tape while Jette
called the reading, Janet read Brunton and Dale took notes and
