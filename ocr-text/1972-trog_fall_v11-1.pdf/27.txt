THE TECH TROGLODYTE
25
The last glimner of daylight saw us back to camp, dinner, and then
to a hard earned nights sleep.
ke decided to lay off Yorkshire for a day since we needed
additional rope and supplies, Bob volunteered to ferry up another
load. But first we visited another cave. The entrances to Gar-
zantua Cave are at about 2,200 feet on a craz face overlooking the
lower benches of the Ancly Good Flateau. The entrance was reached
by climbing two benches above the col and traversing across steep
snow fields. Tie zained the upper entrance and soon found ourselves in
Poggle Alley with daylight filtering in from the lower entrance,
Boggle Alley as well as the many other large passages give rise to
the name of the cave. We found the 56 foot pitch and rappelled on
in. After much climbing and poking around, we emerged into the Inter-
provincial vay, a large trunk channel. At the beginning of the
passage was an area roped off; the center attraction was a neat
cluster of cave pearls- as fine as I've ever seen. The passage ends
in a T-intersection at Two Day Junction, Here we turned back at
over 60 feet coun. Little did we know at the time that the lowest
level just 200 feet was close at hand. Some photography accompanied
our exit after only 4 hours in Garzantua Cave. After a quick lunch
Bob descended to Trog with a load of trash and unnecessary gear and
brought up more gear and a reflector for Dave's lamp, le sacked out
early in eager anticipation of our big push in Yorkshire Fot in the
morning. La intended to get an early start and hoped for a freeze
that would slow the snart melt run-off into the cave.
An early start on August 6. propelled us quickly to our last
rigging point. Arnect with additional tackle, we picked up the cached
ropes at the top of the 30 foot ladder pitch and scrambled down.
The next pitch was a 93 foot rift, The rappel was quite confined in
places- a good thing since our rope was short, but we chimneyed the
last 10 feet. (i tight, awkward squeeze overlooking a difficult
friction chimney led to the next pitch, a 130 foot free fall drop.
This made for a spectacular rappel. One more pitch of 50 feet put
us at the -600 foot level and the beginning of the horizontalis
section of the cave, A short crawl led to the Chocolate Chamber
unere a 140 foot dit is located. ypassing it we entered the Roller
Coaster Run, A phreatic tube incised several times by vadose canyons.
Extremely slippery muc provided excitement in the traverse of these
areas. Taking Alberta Avenue from Second Look Junction, we skidded
downward at dip of 20 degrees to a point where two streams converge
and form the water iieeting. A narrow,sinuous passage led off via
several small drops to a sump at a depth of 11.30 feet. High water
and a unanimous reluctance to get completely immersed prevented us
from pushing the last 20 feet or so, but ve were happy to have reached
that point in only 3 hours. After a few hero photographs, we started
out. The drudgery began with the rope ascents since the 6 rigged
pitches occur within a horizontal span of about 50 feet after each
ascent the amount of tackle to be carried out increased. After less
than 10 hours underground no energed weary but happy from Yorkshire
Pot's snowy entrance.
While Dave decided he was due a good rest, Bob and I scrambled
down below camp to check out a cave known as "F20". Ten ninutes in
