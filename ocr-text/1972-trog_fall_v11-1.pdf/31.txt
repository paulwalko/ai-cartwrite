sketched. They made fine progress for about half an hour, most of
which was spent struggling through really niserable passage. Dale
decided, after a couple of readings, that it could be sketched in
after all (curses to you, Dale Parrott).
Backtracking to a room, the party fanned out to look for more
survey work, Hardly missing Dale, who disappeared down some hole,
the ladies assembled and proceeded to carry on a very enlighening

hole down here. But, alas, despite his outstretched efforts, the
flailing fingers fell short of the pack,
