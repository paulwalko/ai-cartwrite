VISITING A FOX
It started as a rather nice November day at six A .ll. A perfect
day for a leisurely stroll or a cool picnic. Put the four of us,
Bill Park, Susy Arnold, Steve Snelling, and myself, had elected to
spend it in the cold bowels cf the earth, napping Fox Cave of Smyth
County, our contribution to the renciined VPI Grotto Fall Project.
Deing ny part to keep Steve awake, I slept all the way to Hungry
i Other State Park, where we found the rest of the Project personnel
just eating breakfast. After wandering arcund for awhile socializing,
we found out where our chosen target was located and headed off as
one united mapping party,
After going over what should have been an impossible mountain,
we came to the area of the cave and okayod our invasion of Fox with
the landowner. While preparing to find and enter the cave, we met
Darrel immer, a former VPI caver who had started his own grotto
in Smyth. After discussing old times and new, he graciously took
us to the entrance of Fox which was cleverly placed and disguised
by nature sc. only a search and destroy party could find it,
Parting company with Darrel, we entered the cave and started
mapping, our assigned parts being: Bill - Brunton, Steve - setting
stations, Susy - taking notes, ancy - reading tape, although Susy
and I traded jobs about halfway through the trip.
Fox Cave itself is a very nice little cave, for visiting. It
has a countless number of little loops that are interconnected
and a pain tc map. Just as we finished mapping one loop we found
another loop off of the first one. Actually, we only mapped
around four or five of the loops and set the rest aside for another
inapping so we could continue criward and map the upper level of the
cave. The stream section is yet to be surveyed also,
A fifteen or twenty foot climb and some helpful suggestions brought
us to the upper level. From that point we mapped fairly steadily
since there were no major side leads to be explored. Yriggling .
through one rather tight crawl, we came to a "T" junction where we
paused for an eating break. With true mapping fervor we were re-
lieved to find that the left lead after fcrty feet. Finishing that
lead with two quick shots, we tramped down the right lead...mapping,
always mapping. We had been underground around eight hours and were
beginning to feel like part of the cave. -
Then came the mud! ud everywhere, just waiting to trap us!
Yet we continued. Steve and Bill sloughed ahead taking compass and
tape readings while Susy and I stayed behind. Then they had finished,
I went through to skotch it all in one blow. Looking at all that
mud I could imagine sinking into it and never getting out.
