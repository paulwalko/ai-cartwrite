Into account with conditioris on the outside, Going wet caving in
the sunner time isn't too bad if you can look forward to flopping
your tired, wet body on a grassy hillside in the warm sunshine.
Even coming out after dark, it still will be no colder, if not warmer,
than cave temperature. Fater flowing into a cave during the winter
is obviously colder than in the summer and there also may be more
of it, depending on the local climate. A sudden warning spell in
the early spring should be watched with apprehension - runoff from
molting snow is danned cold, any caves, especially those of breath-
ing' fame, can make drastic changes in their rate of airflow because
of a steep gradient between the temperature of the cave and the out-
side. Exhaustion is a great factor contributing to hypothermia and
many a tired person who is cold and wet has been the cause of a grim
situation. In the case of a long trip it should be remembered that
the weakest member of the party is the one who sets the pace for
the rest. One should also consider that a cave, especially a vert-
ical one, takes on a different set of risks when a bunch of inexper-
ienced trainees are taken through than when a couple of super cavers
zipped through just for grins the week before. As a final word
about caves in cold weather, various ascending knots and mechanical
rigs often cease to function on wet and icy ropes. ** If you insist on
caving in such conditions, then you ought to at least find out which
works best at getting you out before you get in.
Every caver has his own preference of caving apparel, whether it
be coveralls, deninz, army surplus, short sleeves, half a dozen sweat-
shirts on what ever he happens to be wearing. Cottons, including
denim, and most synthetics wear well, but lose nearly all their good
as insulators when we to. Pool works better, it holds in some body
heat even when sopping. Rubber or waterproofed boots are fine as
long as you don't step in a pool deeper than your boot tops. The
best way to keep feet reasonably warm in a wet cave is to wear a
couple of pairs of wool socks and jungle boots, The water will pour
in, but it goes out, too. It seems that the best outfit for staying
comfortable, outside of a full wet suit, would be fishnet underwear
(to trap a dead air space) topped off by a wool sweater and wool
pants, Better still, if you know that you're going to get wet, have
a dry change of clothes available, You'll also find that it's well
worth the extra trouble to lug your gear to the entrance to change
clothes, especially if it's a long way back to the car and a foot
of snow has been forecast,
Generally speaking, creatures with an extra layer of fat have
a better chance of survival in extreme cold. This works very well
for Icelandic ponies and polar bears but not necessarily for cavers.
Caving domands that a person be in reasonably good physical shape
and much too often, a person carrying a surplus of natural insu-
lating material is unabie to qualify.
lany a froezing expedition has been brought back to life by
the foresight of bringing a sinall stove or even a catalytic heater
to warm the spirits of cavers preparing to assault the outside world,
