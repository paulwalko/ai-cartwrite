... Last summer our life size likeness of A.I. Cartwright dis-
appeared from the storage room of Shanks Hall where he was residing
for the quarter. Although no one actually saw the crime, it was
conjectured from witnesses that some fratmen thought it would be cool
"to show the guys back at the house. A couple of cavers, incognito,
attended a few frat parties but were unable to locate the missing
A. I. Time passed and there was not a clue as to his whereabouts.
Then, quite unexpectedly, a lead was discovered: some stranger
made a comment about Our Founder to Jan Davis, noticing her Club
T-shirt. Casually inquiring further, she received the info. The
underground forces of the Master of the Virginia Underground were
sent into working. Intricate plans of sabotage and surprise attack
were suggested involving Douty's van installed with submachine guns
and Hixson's truck, Henry, equiped with heavy artillery. But as it
turned out, the rescue was a very simple incident. Saturday morning
Mike Conefry, 'Steve Hall and Don Davison casually walked into the
frat house and took t. I. into safe custody. The only resistance was
a solitary brother who watched dumbly through a hang-over as the
Cavers thanked them for stealing our property. Somewhat worse the
wear, A.I. was taken to the Pig Hole Plantation for safer keeping
and some R and R.

Mammoth and Flint Ridge were officially connected. So, let's get
out there and start digging!
... The Fifth Annual VPI Grotto Halloween Party, sponsored by the
Ladies' Auxilliary was a terrific success this year. The cavers
must have been good this year, for they were visited by Alfred the
Great Pumpkin, bringing gifts in the form of kegs of beer. A bat-
shaped pinata called Beatrice bestowed goodies upon the party also.
There were many celebraties attending - Kim Smith came as a radio
announcer, many wizards, neocramancers and assorted other evil crea-
tures. A yeti even showed up disguised as Rick Keener. A dragon
consisting of Whitt & Annie & Lynn & Wes & Jette took the prize for
the scariest, Randy Wood as that grinning Man from Glad was the most
original and the well-endowed Ed Richardson was certainly (tho hardly )
the least. And last of all, Tuna Johnson got the Booby prize for
being such a fish. Such a fine speleo-seminar it was, that much
inginuity and preparation will be needed to top it next year.
... This year at the Old Timers' Reunion Ed Buckwheat" Rich-
ardson, after one bad start due to technical difficulties, literally
hauled ass with his cam rig to take the 100 foot rope climb with a
time of 41.5 seconds. He may have to shave a couple of seconds to top
the national record, but nonetheless it's fantastic to watch such a
