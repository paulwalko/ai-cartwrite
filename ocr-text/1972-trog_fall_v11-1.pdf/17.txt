TRIP LEADING
Every caver who does not cave solo has either led or has been
led on a caving trip. There are certain aspects of trip leading that
perhaps may be worthy of mentioning for new cavers who may lead
trips in the near future. This article is by no means an exact
check list of good cave leadership, nor are all the points to be
mentioned of .oqual importance (if so at all). But it does intend
to orient new cavers toward thinking about trip leading so that they
may become more aware of the good and bad points of people leading
then. There are no formal definitions and no set rules that may
be applied to all situations, regardless of circumstances; but
there are certain hélpful guidelines that may channel the individ-
ual's thinking toward being a safe and competent leader.
The trip leader :
- should be a competent caver, capable of doing what the
particular trip requires and he should be knowledgeable (if at all
possible) of the cave to be visited.
- should know the individuals on his trip and should have the
final decision as to whether a member is qualified to join the
trip. The leader should make an effort to know the limitations or
peculiarities of the members. The leader should not allow persons
on the trip whom he feels would not respect his decisions.
e should treat all members equally and allow no personal ·
prejudice to enter the cave. Personal problems botueen members
should constitute refusing one or both individuals to come on the
trip.
- should see that all members of the trip are aware of the
difficulty, approximate duration and what kind of trip it will be.
is responsible for the equipment required to see the cave
safely. He should know the condition of the equipment and arrange.
for it to be properly taken care of. Each member should be adequate.
ly equipped and if not, should not go in.
- is responsible for the overall safety of the trip and dis-
courage unsafe practices. He should also provide a belay for any-
one who wants or needs one.
should insist on proper cave conservation practices,
Trips should not be split up unless there are adequate leaders
and all those affected are in agreement, !o one should be left alone,
Vertical Caves
On a vertical trip, or on a trip with many inexperienced: cavers
a leader should be sure to have at least one other competent and ex-
perienced caver along.
