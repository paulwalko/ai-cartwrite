THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1972
All rigging of ropes and gear should be inspected before use
by a competent caverio
Competent vertical cavers should descend the ... rope first
and last so that all others may be checked before they rappel to
insure their being properly clipped to the rope and ready to go,
รก knot should be tied in the end of the rope and the first man
down should be prepared to ascend while on rope if this becomes nec-
essary, Tho leader should offer a belay to all and insist that new
cavers receive one, Proper calls should be taught and used.
Ascending the rope should follow the same order as rappeling:
competant vertical cavers first and last to check rigs, and to also
help out on top.
A belay should be available for all cable ladder climbs, es-
pecially for novice cavers, Factors of lengths of climbs and fatigue
should be taken into consideration in belaying of cable ladders.
Preparation for belaying the first man up should be made ( a sepa
arate ropo prepared for a belay from below or a rigged rope to ascend).
After the Trip
The leader is responsible for the trip to be signed in and
out properly if caving through a club, If not, soneone with a know-
ledge of rescue procedures should know of his plans.
The leader is responsible for the safety of the members to and
from the cave unless they meet at the cave site. Prparations for
staying overnight should be made, if the trip is a long and hard one
and it's a long way home.
The leader should see that all equipment is properly cared for
and all borrowed equipnont returned.
If an emergency arises the leader should handle the situation
and should have the final word on decisions concerning the emer-
gency situation. He must decide when outside help is needed and
must see that this help is safely obtained.
