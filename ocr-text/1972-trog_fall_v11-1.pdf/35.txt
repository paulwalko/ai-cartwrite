FALL
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1972
33
After the mud room we only mapped a few hundred more feat.
It was getting to be a long trip and we agreed at the next room we
would bag it until our next trip, when we reached our goal we put
away our mapping gear and did some more exploring. There were sev-
eral pits on the left of the room which dropped down to a second
stream and seened to be connected. The main passage itself ended
in a couple hundred feet though there is a possibility of unchecked
leads.
Eleven and a half hours and nine hundred feet of surveyed pas-
sage brought us into the cold night air. As for what is left, we
still need to do the downstream and upstream sections. From what
we saw and previous descriptions, it will probably take only one more
trip to complete Fox, something I am looking forward to.
