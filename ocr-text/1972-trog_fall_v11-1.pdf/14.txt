COLD. IS JUST A FOUR LETTER VORD
inter is, especially around this part of the country, the most
dangerous time of the year for caving. The underestimation of con.
ditions and a lack of understanding of hypothermia is said to be
the number one killer of outdoor recreationists. Most cave rescues
are caused, or at least greatly complicated, by foul conditions
of cold and wet. jora cavers have succumbed to exposure than of
falls, hangups or other caving accidents. Being cold is unpleasant,
but when exposure sets in, it can be very serious.
Hypothermia is caused by exposure to cold, aggravated by wind,
water and exhaustion. When your body begins to lose heat faster
than it generates it, you are undergoing exposure, When clothes
are wet, they lose approximately ninety percent of their insulating
value. Some materials hoia heat and protect you better than others,
but regardless of what you're wearing, if it's wot, you'll get cold,
Wind complicatos things by driving cold air through wet clothes and
robbing your body of what heat it is producing. The first sign
of hypothermia is uncontrolled and sometinos violent shivering.
Hands and feet can take a certain anount of cold, but loss of only
a few degrees of body temperature in the head or trunk areas will
cause death. Involuntary shivering is your body's way of desper-
ately trying to generate heat, but unfortunately this doesn't work
too well. If the situation worsens then one begins to stumble or
have difficulty porfcoming tasks and sometimes suffer a loss in men-
ory. If thy person loses the desire to move, or worse yet, falls to
sleep, then he and you are in big trouble. Even if the victim
insists he's alright, especially if oxhaustion is a contributing
factor, the situation can deteriorate very quickly without much
warning.
Of course, the best thing to do when you start shivering is
to get moving. Under most circunstancos, climbing, crawling or just
walking will make a cold caver generate enough heat to stay warm. If
the situation becomes quite serious, anything that will raise the
body temperaturo should be used. Protection from water and wind,
hot 'drinks, changing into dry clothes and even heat from a carbide
lamp will usually help considerably. For maximum offectiveness
in warming a cold person fast, one source recommends skin to skin
contact in a slooping bag,
This kind of information is available in any first aid manual
or hiking book, but what are the specific dangers that present then-
selves in winter caving? First of all, many people don't realize
that the temperaturo doesn't have to be sub-freezing for exposure
to happen. Fost cases of hypothermia occur when the temperature
is between 30 and 50 degrees and any casual caver could tell you
that this is the temperature range of caves, Understimating of
cave air and water temperatures, air currents, length and depth of
passage can be serious, especially if these conditions are not taken
