Dear Cavers,
mot too long ago I emerged from Clover Hollou to pay a visit to
the world topside. It gets lonely down there sometimes, not too
much traffic these days. Since it was a Friday, I thoucht that I
would drop into the VPI Grotto get-together, incognito of course,
since it can be such a nuisance to be a celebrity. There were a
fer old faces, but mostly ner and it has a good party, indeed. But,
something was odd, everyone seemed to be having a good time and I
couldn't quite put my finger on it at the time.
It must have been my aching head the next morning, but then it
came to me, Thinking back at the party I recollected that when I
first got there I wasn't positive where I was. But then, over in the
corner, I heard someone mention something about Rewberry-Banes, and
then I was assured I was at the right party. Although people rere
enjoying themselves, there was something missing. Bobody was cele-
brating anything. ivo long survey was just completed, no nev cave
discovered. There is some thing that grows between cavers when they share
the thrill of a hairy climb, the excitement of virgin passage, the ex-
haustion of a long trip or the joy of just getting out of some god-awful.
hole alive. People who grin at the smell of spent carbide, are excited
by the sensation of cave air and dream of that hole that keeps going,
have some thing in common, something we call "fellotiship. It's not just
being friends, but knowing that you can depend on and trust someone.
I began to wonder, just ho? long has it been since those people at the
party have lingered in a small room and just listened to the silence
interupted only by fragile drips of water? When was the last time
you really craved to go caving? tiow many of you have mud in your blood ?
Then I began to think, what about ner! people, those not acquainted with
caving? Usually the first thing one notices is the remarkable bond
between cavers, one that just isn't found in frats or sororities. Could
it be that there is a ritual Githout the belief behind it? Maybe some of
you are going to church and not beleiving in God. Seeing that kind of
hypocracy turns people away from organized religion. If the spirit of
caving has been misplaced, then look for it. If you've never had it,
find it, it's there. If you don't want to bother, then go your way,
but don't call yourself a caver.
I hope that you'll see that the greatest way to worship life is to
appreciate nature and I personally feel that the best way to do that.
is to go caving! See ya'll soon.
Yours in Peace,
A, I. Cartwright
