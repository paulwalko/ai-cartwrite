BLACK IS BLACK, OR IS IT?
most people think that liars belong entirely to the hunting and
fishing circles, yet few realize that caving is another field in
which these"truth strechers abound. Although cavers don't use
the same form of exaggerations as the one that got awayil, they have
their own style which shines at its best in conversing with people
who know little or nothing about caving, especially girl friends.
Yep, you can bet that in their stories it was only through super-
human efforts that they managed to save themselves and the rest of
the party from complete annihilation in the hardest and most dan-
gerous cave in the world.
It has been my observation that the best liars are those who
have been caving for a few years. I don't mean this derogatorily,
for it takes all this time to develop this skill with true finesse,
Following are two trip reports on a short conservation trip
to the Queen's Path in Pig Hole Cave, a very easy part of the cave,
The first one is a typical one written by a trainee with little
caving experience. The second is representative of a grizzled
veteran of at least two years! caving,
Trainee's Report:.
we entered Pig Hole by the back entrance, a man-made section
of square tile piping about seven feet long extending straight down
to retard filling in by the soil around the entrance. After slid-
ing on our backs for a matter of a couple of feet, we entered a
large passage with silt type dirt covering the floor,
The passage remained fai√°ly constant in size for some distance
although the silt floor changed co some large blocks of breakdown.
The passage stayed much like this until we had to climb up a
large block and crawl along a mud. ledge for about twenty feet until
we came to a passage which varied between a large crawlway and a
stoop-over passage for a short distance. At the end of this passage
was the the Queen's Bath, the object of our conservation trip,
He began cleaning the names from the wal1 by rubbing them with
our gloves and mud. This task tool a short time, so on our way
back we stopped at the mud Bridge viich traverses an 80 ft. pit,
Since time was short we didn't go across, re then returned to the
lower entrance and letto
The Veteran's Report:
e arrived at the murderous cave and at once argued about
which entrance to enter by. I wanted to go down the sinkhole, but
the others said they were afraid to rappel without a rope. I then
decided that it would be better to see that they got safely into the
treacherous cave, so I accompanied then to the lower entrance which
is less impressive, but nonetheless dangerous.
