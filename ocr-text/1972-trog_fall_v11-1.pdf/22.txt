FALL
THE TECH TRCGLODYTE
1972
We slid down the vertical shaft which was so smooth and slick
that it made travel extremely hazardous. After passing this obstacle,
we entered a large passage, the floor of which was covered with sil.c.
Atthough it looked like easy walking, we were wary, for how could we
be certain that we weren't standing on a thin false floor that could
crumble at any minute and send us hurtling down into a pit thausands
of feet deep?
Things got worse, for we soon were walking on huge hunks of
breakdown as large as cars, which could toppie at a touch and
crush us in an instant. After this we climbed to the top of the rub-
ble and crawled precariously on a mud ledge above a deep canyon,
I managed to make it past this great challenge only with tho ability
of a natural born leader who can direct others,
He then came to the Queen's Bath area, another highly dangerous
spot because one slip could send you crashing helplessly into a vast
subterranean pool. The proceeded to scrape the names from the walls
with our own hands protected only by flimsy leather heavy duty work
gloves.
After completing this physically grueling task , we went to the
Mud Bridge, I wanted to go across the fifteen foot wide pit which
is probably thousands of feet deep. But the others said that they
didn't want to junp it with me, but would prefer to cross the bridge,
I became rather indignant and told them that unless they jump across
with me, then nobody would cross,
De finally macle our way over the same treacherous ground
back to the entrance. Climbing out of the cave presented so much
difficulty to the others, that I was required to provide physical
assistance to each and every one, Being last to exit, and exhausted
in my duties, I was made to accept the then feeble efforts of the
others on my party.
The Kave Kreep
"Yup,...once threw a dead cow down thar... Fell for
ages and when it finally hit, one whole cave up and
beltched. Why, the wind narely blew me down ma hill,
