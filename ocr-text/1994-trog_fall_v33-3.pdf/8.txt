A Trip Report (original, no?)
by Steve LePera
.
Well, it was early in the morning, cold, dark, and I was too tired to move. I was
sure happy that it was the weekend so I could get up 2 hours earlier than usual and
go spend 12 hours in an icy wet and slimy hole in the ground.
Containing my excitement, I calculated the absolute minimum amount of time it
would require to carry the gear from my closet out to my car. I knew that, since |
hadn't touched anything since the last trip, it would all be stuck efficiently together. No
chance of leaving any important stuff behind (Caving tip #1).
I watched the clock tick another minute closer to 8 am. In two more minutes |
would have to get up.
In reality, you should have your license suspended if you operate your motor
vehicle too early in the morning. If the government really had our well being in mind
that would be the case. Amazingly I left my bed and appeared in the back seat of
Lawrence Britt's truck with my gear. I think I may have even spoken before Lawrence,
Steve Wells, and I arrived at Murder Hole.
Don't you hate it when you are ready to get underground and someone is
piddling around trying to get their act together? I do. That's why I always pack my
stuff at the cave. It gives me a good chance to go over my equipment and be sure
everything is ready to go, and you never need to wait on the other cavers (Tip #2,
valid only when not caving with me).
Murder Hole is very nice. I don't think I thought that the first time I went there,
but it is true. You are usually greeted by the rotting corpse of some dead critter at the
bottom of the drop. They inevitably drag their mangled bodies in front of the small
entrance slot before cashing it in. If you are lucky you can see the maggots crawling
around inside them as you pass by into the cave.
If you like to straddle spread eagle over deep pits, this is the cave for you. The
nice thing about all these pits are their similarity to TV violence. After following Steve
Wells for a little while, you become desensitized and they just don't seem that bad
anymore.
On this particular trip, our goal was to survey a 90 ft pit just past Double Wells
and finish surveying the man-eating, ascender cam-tooth-polishing area called 7
Second pit. I suspect this name originated when someone tossed a loose rock (read:
previous handhold) down the drop and never heard it hit the bottom. "Wow, what a
deep pit," they must have exclaimed. Of course, there is no 800 ft pit in Murder Hole,
or anywhere else in this area either. What really happened was that the mud at the
bottom reached up and silently swallowed the rock. Seven seconds, really, is the time
it takes to free your foot from the mud there after you've been standing in one place
too long.
On our way back to 7 Second, we passed several noteworthy places. We
passed the Elevator, where on my very first survey trip into the cave I lost my carbide
lamb down the drop and into a stream. The base, of course, was destroyed.
Fortunately Lawrence had his trusty backup lamp in his pack...
We passed near Atlantis. I have been to Atlantis. It really is the most beautiful
piece of this cave I've seen so far. Everyone should check it out. A must see.
We crossed the Butt Ledge. The first few times I crossed the butt ledge, I
crawled. The great thing about this is how your gear hangs out over the drop and
