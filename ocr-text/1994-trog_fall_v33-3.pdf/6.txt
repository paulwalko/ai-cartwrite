1/06/95 Convention Planning Meeting
by Carol Tiderman
At this meeting several significant commitments were made by VPI. We will be
camping at the South Athletic Field, using all of the Donaldson Brown, Auditorium in
Squires, and Burrus. Shower Access will be the visiting team locker room in the gym
(men), the visiting team locker room in the coliseum (women), lockers in the War
Memorial Gym, and in the dorm we are assigned. We have the Duck Pond area for
the Howdy Party with a rain substitute area at the Stadium. The gymnastics room in
the War Memorial Gym will be available for Vertical Contest. The Wesley Center can
be used for session. We have authorization to place professional look directional
signs on campus. This, in addition to several other promising locations, have put us in
a good posture.
