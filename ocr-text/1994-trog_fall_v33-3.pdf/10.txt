performance.
Nevertheless, as you must know since I've written this, I made it up the rope
and out of 7 Second. Another efficient 40 ft/hour survey trip completed, we headed
back towards the entrance. We felt pretty proud since we had actually finished the
part of the cave we came to work on. A rare event.
At the entrance we found a torrential rainstorm. Well, maybe it wasn't that bad,
but once I was on rope, my lamp went dead, the rain seemed to double in intensity,
and to make things even less convenient I couldn't see anything because my glasses
were quickly coated with mud splashing down from my arms and ascender, I knew I
had nearly reached the top when I crashed my head into the lip. "I must be at the
top," were my cheerful words. Ask anyone. The only good thing I can say about that
climb was that the hood in my suit worked Wunderfully.
Naturally, the rain subsided once we were all out of the pit. We didn't care
because we knew the other great thing about caving with Lawrence was waiting for us
in his truck.
The post-survey beverage is the best beverage you will ever drink. And sitting
there in the light drizzle getting changed, I felt great. I felt great because Murder Hole
really is a great cave.
Murder Hole wants me, so I'm going back. Want to come along? :)
