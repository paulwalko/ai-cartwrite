Most Indiana Bat hibernacula are in Kentucky, Indiana, and Missouri. Two have been
located and studied here in Illinois. The Blackball Mine (abandoned) in north-central Illinois is
along side the Illinois river and Cave Springs Cave in southeastern Illinois is near the Ohio
River. Recently, a third hibernaculum at Fogelpole Cave has been discovered in Monroe
County, Illinois near the Mississippi River (Garner and Gardner, 1992):
The major Indiana Bat hibernacula in the entire United States (or world for that matter)
are located in only seven caves or mines in the Midwest which contain 85% of the total
population. Two of these contain almost 50% (Richteret al., 1993). Hibernating colonies have
been reported with up to 100,000 individuals (discussed later). No wonder that the Indiana
Bat is endangered since it clusters in so few locations and in very dense clusters of
thousands, closely packed at about 300 individuals per square foot.

SUMMER HABITAT:
Female Indiana Bats begin leaving their winter hibernacula in March and early April to
migrate to their summer maternal roosts. They then ovulate and become pregnant with the
sperm stored in their bodies throughout the winter. Males are in less of a rush to return to an
active life and may stay dormant until
May or some into early June (Walley,
1970).
'Female Indiana Bats fly to their
maternal colony roosts under the loose
bark of dead trees alongside waterways
at which they will start feeding to
replenish the weight and energy lost
throughout the long winter. A typical
female Indiana Bat enters hibernation
weighing 8.8 grams and awakens
weighing 7.2 grams. The summer roosts
are often a considerable distance from
the hibernacula (100 miles and more).
The long flights, which usually follow
waterways such as the Mississippi,
Ohio, Illinois Rivers, etc., must be very
straining on a bat in this famished

condition and many fatalities probably
result. Summer roosts are less well known than are the hibernacula, but most are know to
exist in the regions of dense woods near major or minor waterways (usually within one to
three kilometers range from the roost). Flood plain regions seem to be a favorite location
(although an increasingly scarce one). Here food is abundant and roosts can be found in
dead trees shielded by the canopy from direct sunlight. Temperatures of 25 to 35C (77 to
95F) are preferred. If it gets much hotter, the bat may overheat and die. The adult female
bats remain in their roosts from dawn
to dusk (more than 15 hours) and emerge at night to feed. Maternal colonies are generally
smaller than hibernating colonies and consist of 50 to 100 adults. Many summer roost are in
Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, and Michigan. Some have been reported in Illinois.
Suitable forested areas next to waterways is the key factor (Clark et al., 1987)(Garner and
Gardner, 1992)(Kurta, Kath, et al., 1993)(Kurta, King, et al., 1993)(Walley, 1970).
The summer roosts of the male and juvenile Indiana Bats are less well known. Some
have been found to move to different areas of the same mine or cave in which they
hibernated. These roosts are evidently different since the floor will now be covered with guano
since they now travel outdoors to feed and therefore defecate. Recall that the hibernacula of
the Indiana Bats do not have guano piles. Males are likewise starved when they emerge from
