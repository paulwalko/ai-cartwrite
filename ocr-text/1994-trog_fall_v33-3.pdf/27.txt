dormancy. Typically a male hibernates weighing 8.0 grams and awakens weighing just 6.3
grams (very hungry indeed - bye bye mosquito).
MATERNITY:
Birth of a single pup per adult female occurs in June and early July. The pups are
born as big babies when compared to their small mothers. They often weigh 25% to 35% of
their mother's weight at birth. The pups nurse on the milk of their own mother for the first
three weeks. By sight, smell, and maybe sound, the mother bat can identify her own pup
among a hundred other hungry babies. The babies mature quickly and by week-three start
eating insects bought to them along with the mother's milk. By week-four they can fly and
start on a life of their own (Fenton, 1992).
ENDANGERED SPECIES:
Some horror stories and some hopeful ones tell the story of an endangered animal that
is in its eleventh hour. It may survive. If so, we must change our own ways of destruction into
ways of help. First, I will tell some of the tragedies, natural and man-made that put this once
abundant species on the Federal Endangered Species List. After that, I will describe some
good moves already underway and some still needed.

HORROR STORIES:
Let's start in Virginia in 1968 (Tuttle, 1991). A bunch of cavers routinely visited a cave
that was a hibernaculum for about 100,000 Indiana Bats. When told about it, Merlin Tuttle
(now head of Bat Conservation International, BCI) wanted to see it during the next winter and
was shown the cave in 1969. Only 1,200 Indiana Bats remained. Where were the other
bats? Gone elsewhere, run off by constant disturbance by cavers? Tuttle thinks not. A
single disturbance from the sleep of hibernation means that the bat must raise its body
temperature from slightly above freezing to active body temperature of 35C (95F) at a cost of
10 to 30 days reserve of body fat. Tuttle thinks that the disturbances cost the bats their lives
(100,000 destroyed in one winter by well meaning cavers)! The Indiana Bat is now seldom
seen at all in the eastern United States. Remember the Passenger Pigeon!
. You can read Merlin Tuttle's excellent account of this occurrence and others in "How .
North American's Bats Survive the Winter" in Bats, Vol. 9, No.3. Fall 1991. Bats is the
quarterly magazine of Bat Conservation International (BCI) (Tuttle, 1991). Basic membership
is $25 per year (seniors/students $20). The address is Bat Conservation International, P.O.
Box 162603, Austin, TX 78716. I have no affiliation with BCI, except for being a member for a
number of years and the firm conviction that BCl is doing excellent and necessary work to
educate people and to save the bats of the world. End of commercial.
In 1993, Andreas Richter, et. al. wrote about the danger to bats of modified cave
entrances. This article in Conservation Biology (Richter et al., 1993) contains more horror
stories. In the 1960s the world wide population of Indiana Bats (wholly in the United States)
was estimated to be more than 640,000 (probably a million or more). In 1981, it was 550,000
and in 1991352,000. That is a loss of about 65% in 30 years and accelerating.
In Dome (Coach) Cave, Edmunson County, KY a hibernaculum contained 100,000
Indiana Bats in the 1960s. In 1975, a heavy steel gate was installed on the main entrance to
"protect the cave." Bats could still enter and leave through smaller holes. The population of
Indiana Bats almost instantly dropped to 4,500 and continued to drop to only 50 in 1991.
Why? They could still enter and leave. The reason was that the gate had altered the
temperature in the hibernaculum from the desirable 4 to 6C (39 to 43F) to an unacceptable
10.5 to 11.40 (51 to 53F). The Indiana Bat has a lifelong attachment to the same
hibernaculum and probably just came back and died. Good intentions - bad results. The gate
has since been modified to allow temperatures to return to normal, but the bats have never
come back.
