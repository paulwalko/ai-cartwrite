"stupid caver tricks" happening all around the world. The entrance to the cemetery is marked by a small
wooden bell tower.
We did not get to visit Castle Cave of Buda which lies in the heart of the Castle district (a major tourist area).
Instead, we spent what time we had left talking with Dr. Kosa about caving in Hungary and about Hungarian
life and times.
Our study abroad trip next provided us with short stays in Vienna and Graz, Austria. Although I had
information about several commercial caves near Vienna and Graz, we had no time to visit them. We had
a longer stay in Maribor, Slovenia formerly part of Yugoslovia.
Here is where reading tour books really paid off. There is limited tour book information on Slovenia but I was
able to find an old Yugoslovian tour book. The 1960-era glossy pictures describing Postojnska jama made
it a cave trip we had to make. To get to the cave Bob and I took a 4 hour train ride (one way), getting off
at a train station smaller than Petticoat Junction's station. Fortunately there was a tourist office inside the
train station that provided us with a map of the town and how to get to the cave. An easy walk down
through town and to the cave took 30 minutes.
The tour book states a 10,000 people visit the cave each day during prime tourist season (May-September).
We were skeptical at first but became believers after walking through the gauntlet of gift shops and gift
kiosks to get to the entrance. Since we were visiting right before prime season, the cave only offered trips
every hour. We requested an English speaking tour and was told the Noon trip would be in English. We also
overheard the ticket taker tell others that it would be in Italian, French, and German. Hmmm....
At the entrance, there was a concession stand that rented hooded coats for a $1.00. Wisely I rented one.
The doors opened at noon and we were funneled to a train. Actually, it was more like a roller coaster, given
the size of the car and gauge of the track. The tour starts with a 10 minute train ride going about 30
kilometers per hour. Each train holds 120 visitors and was first used in 1872.
A little bit of information about the cave: the cave system lies in the Pivka River Basin on a plateau 300-600
meters above the river in the Alpine-Dinaric Mountains. The Postojna cave system is over 23 kilometers long
and consists of several caves. These include Postojna, Pivka, Tartarus, Lekinka, Otok, Magdalena, and Black
Cave. Pivka and Black Caves are also commercialized. Unfortunately we didn't have time to visit them.
Postojna Cave contained evidence that prehistoric man used the cave. The first documentable evidence of
visitation into the cave comes from a signature on wall of the Gallery of Old Signatures, dated 1213. The
cave was seriously commercialized in 1818.
The train ride takes you through several highly decorated rooms and stops at The Great Mountain. Here it
becomes evident why the ticket takers said the tour would be English, Italian, French, German,.... At various
locations up the path of the Great Mountain were lighted signs for various languages (9 total). Our "English"
tour consisted of 5 people. One British woman brought 2 Russian friends who spoke English (the tour is not
offered in Russian) and the 2 of us. The 1.5 km walking tour starts by winding up and around the Great
Mountain. From there you make your way to the Nice Gallery and Russian Gallery. Both are immense rooms
filled from floor to ceiling with a variety of speleothems. The passages between the galleries are also highly
decorated. It is difficult to explain how beautiful this cave is. "Pretties" for as far as the eye can see. Just
when you think you have seen the most stunning set of formations around the next corner were more (5
rolls of 36 exposures more!). Besides the wonderful formations, the cave is home to the Proteus Anguinus.
The salamander is kept in a large holding tank for the visitors to ohh and ahh over. Also, its likeness is sold
on t-shirts, pot holders, novelties, and is even carved into the concrete pillars of the shops and buildings.
The hour and a half tour ends in the Concert Hall which is 40 meters high and can hold 10,000 visitors in
chairs. The train ride out takes you through a room where the Germans in World War II had a fuel dump.
The dump was blown up by saboteurs leaving the room black but otherwise unscathed. You exit the cave
along side the huge river, complete with dam, that runs 18.5 meters below the tourist trail.
