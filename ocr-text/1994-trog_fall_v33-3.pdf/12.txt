COMMERCIAL CAVING IN EUROPE
by Jackie Hoell
Bob and I had the opportunity to visit Europe through a Study Abroad program the Department of
Management at VA Tech offered, during May & June of 1994. I prepared for the trip by reading several travel
books for each city/country we were to visit. Naturally, I would search the index of each travel book for
possible commercial caves to visit. In addition, I was able to download quite a bit of information about
commercial caves in the various countires from America On-Line (Check in the travel section). I was quite
surprised at how many opportunities we would have.
I must admit the research I did ahead of time paid off. Knowing the opening and closing times and general
locations (or actual directions) enabled us to plan cave trips that fit into our busy study abroad schedule.
I also wrote to the NSS members listed in the membership directory living in the European cities we visited.
What a tremendous help they were (details to follow).
Our trip started in Amsterdam. Being a low lying country with land reclaimed from the sea, I initially didn't
check for caves to visit in the Netherlands. Fortunately, the book I purchased had information about caves
in the city of Maastricht in the southeast corner of the Netherlands. The day our study abroad group was
to travle from Amsterdam to Frankfurt, Germany, we used our Eurail pass to take an out-of-the-way side trip
to Maastricht. We knew we could get directions and tickets at Maastricht's Visitors and Convention Bureau.
We had 2 choices. A boat trip down the river Meuse to visit the Zonneberg System or taking the local bus
to the Northern Gallery System. Our schedule dictated that we visit the Northern Gallery System only.
The city bus dropped us off at the base of Mount St. Peter. A steep hike up to the check-in trailer took 15
minutes. Our tour guide led us down the path to the cave entrance carrying one 4 D cell flashlight and 2
Coleman lanterns. This was the tour's only light sources. Our guide carried the flashlight to point things out
with and 1 of the lanterns. She asked a gentleman to carry the other lantern and bring up the rear. Being
a good caver I did carry my own 3 sources of light into the cave, my mini-mag flashlight, flash on my
camera, and a pack of matches I had just picked up. The following geological and historical descriptions
of the cave are from the Maastricht Visitor Bureau's brochure on the cave.
"Mount St. Peter is formed out of a marl table-land by erosion of the valleys of the rivers
Meuse and Jeker. This table-land was formed 80 million years ago during the Cretaceous
Era, by the accumulation of the remains of shellfish. Marl, a kind of sandstone, was found
to be particularly suitable for building houses and has been cut into blocks for a very long
time. Most of the caves 20,000 passages have been enlarged by the removal of the blocks
of Marl. At various places all kinds of fossils are to be found in the walls and ceilings; shells,
sea hedgehogs, sharks' teeth and pieces of petrified reptile bones. In 1770 the head of a
reptile was found called the Mosasaurus, purported to be 20 meters long. A giant turtle
fossil was also found.
In the military history of Maastricht, Mount St. Peter and its caves have been of great
importance. Subterranean fights between the French and the Dutch took place in 1794.
During the second World War the galleries were prepared for sheltering people in case of
air-raids including ovens, a well and a hospital. Many of the Dutch museum pieces were
stored here during the war."
The cave had very few formations due to the excavation of the sandstone blocks. The limestone underneath
the sandstone layer had also been mined. The cave was filled with charcoal paintings and sculptures that
provided a unique underground experience. The cave had an average temperature of 10Â° C and only goes
to a depth of 35 meters. The tour took about one hour and was given in English and Dutch. I forgot to write
down the cost of the tour but I am sure it was less than $10. We definitely want to return and visit the larger
system, Zonneberg, but we will need at least 5 hours because of the boat trip required to get to the
entrance.
