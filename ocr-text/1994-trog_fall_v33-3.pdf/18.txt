Grotto Grapevine
by A.I. Cartwright
So here we are, at the beginning of another semester. Time to start up, buckle down,
and gossip! Let's start from the beginning.
Let's see, who's new in the club this year? Will and Zenah Orndorf introduced T.J..
their new little girl. Ed and Linda Devine now have Jeremy, and Brian and Kathi
Emery added Ed to their collection. Matt Seigler and Erica Freiberger have recently
announced their engagement; perhaps they'll be adding to the trainee population?!
Two others that have decided to tie the knot: Gary Moss and Barbara Bradshaw (and
she did the asking).
Now let's see who's old in the club. Walt Pirie springs to mind, celebrating his
birthday in late December. Craig Ferguson was feeling blue when he realized that just
a week before, he had turned half of Walt's age. He immediately quit smoking and
started eating broccoli. Carol Zokaites will soon hit a milestone year, but got rid of the
excess baggage of a gallstone.
Speaking of injuries, Jen Savage discovered that Dominos Pizza is bad for your health
when she wound up in the hospital with an ulcer. Sandy Knapp proved her psychic
abilities when she exited from a car that was soon to burn down -- unfortunately, the
car was still moving at 70 mph at the time of her departure (there ought to be a rule
against her using modes of transportation that go above 5 mph).
VPI found a new club tarp at OTR this year. It seems the newly opened West Virginia
Brewing Company set up shop, offering $5 mugs and unlimited refills all weekend. If
you didn't see your friends at their campsite, you knew where to find them .... It was
a first for many -- actually taking beer home from OTR.
Mark Eisenbees wanted to be mentioned in the Grapevine.
The Halloween party brought out its usual crowd of partiers: Lt. Worf, King and Mrs.
Tut, Minnie Mouse, and the occasional bum off the street (sorry, the Devil with the
Blue Dress was unable to attend).
Paul Kirchman has recently been running around with an art student. Until he brought
her to the New Years Party, everyone had assumed he'd gotten another date from the
Acme Inflatable Doll Company.
Ed and Lynn Richardson hosted the aforementioned New Years Party again. The
folks gathered there finished off 3 kegs of beer with only a minimal number of
keg/automobile collisions. Afternoon entertainment consisted of watching men push
large vans through the mud in attempts to get them unstuck.
