If you are ever within a day's train ride of Postojna Cave you need to find a way there. You can get there
from Trieste, Italy, rather easily. Words cannot express the grandeur this cave possesses. We are definitely
going back and plan to stay either in the 1000 bed hotel next to the cave entrance or in the campground.
Please note: Outside the cave there are numerous signs indicating that you cannot take pictures inside the
cave. But I did take 5 rolls of film with no problems or hassles. The reason for the no photo signs is because
the tour will not wait for you. To move the volume of people they have visiting the cave through the cave,
the tour guides move at a steady pace. There is no time to set up a tripod shot. When we visit again we
hope to make arrangements for a "photo" trip.
Our next caving opportunity would come while we were in Prague. I had written NSS member Dr. Pavel
Bosak ahead of time. Dr. Bosak indicated that about 40 km outside of Prague there was a commercial cave
that he recommended visiting. I was to call when I arrived in Prague for further information. Unfortunately,
I was unable to meet up with Dr. Bosak and did not get to go caving. I did notice that the American Express
office on St. Wencelas Square in Prague offered an all-day trip to the cave Dr. Bosak recommended. The
American Express tour also included visits to several castles. Maybe next time..
From Prague, the study abroad group went to Munich. The group did a day trip to Neuschwanstein Castle.
Mad Ludwig's castle includes its own "grotto". King Ludwig had a room built that simulated a cave with
stalactites and stalagmites. As with all of the rooms in the castle there was a secret passage entrance in the
Grotto Room. It took some looking but we found it. Photographs of any of the rooms in Neuschwanstein
were forbidden. We had been assured that the gift shop had pictures and slides. The gift shop had 100's
of pictures and slides, but none of the Grotto Room. Phooey! Next time I think I will risk a picture or two.
Bob and I took a 6 day layover in Paris while the rest of the study abroad group flew home from Munich.
Yes, we even visited caves and pseudo-caves while in Paris. The caves we visited were all manmade caves
at Euro Disney. The most impressive was the Dragon's Lair under Cinderella's Castle. We also visited
Keehaul Cave, Pirates of the Caribbean Cave, and Big Thunder Mountain Cave.
A little more realistic, but not truly cave trips, were visits to the Crypt at Notre Dame and the Sewer Museum.
The Crypt at Notre Dame was discovered recently when a new subway station was being excavated. Pre-
Roman ruins were found. A self guided tour of the ruins is a nice way to get out the Parisian heat and get
underground. Our most unique underground visit of the entire trip was to the Sewer Museum. An absolute
must if you ever visit Paris. Seriously! The self guided walking tour has displays in English of the history,
geography, science, and technology of the Paris sewer system. The English translations were the best we
had seen in any museum. I enjoyed looking at the 2 dozen carbide lamps displayed. A caver could really
feel at home in a Paris sewer...
We were surprised at how easy it was to go commercial caving while on our trip. The research we did and
the letters we wrote really paid off. It will be at least 2 years before we can travel overseas again, but I am
already making plans to go caving when we do.
