kind of pulls you slowly down the sloping shelf behind it. Very safe. I recently got
double dog dared into doing the butt ledge (who would have thought, who could have
imagined) on my butt. There are doubters among you, but listen to me: You are all
silly people to crawl across the butt ledge. Butting the butt ledge is so much easier
than crawling I will never crawl across again (Tip #3, valid if you promise not to fall off
the ledge while following my advice).
We went past Double Wells. I've heard Leroy throwing rocks in from an
adjacent pit but never dropped down there myself. Hopefully I'll get the chance (on
rope of course) sometime soon.
We reached the 90 ft pit. All the rocks in this area were sharpened hundreds of
years ago by Native American cavers for use as arrowheads, so lots of padding was
required. We dropped in, padding all the way down, and swamped through 50 ft of
passage at the bottom to a sump at the end. We killed an hour swimming around
there and trying to connect over the sump through channels in the ceiling. Lawrence
made a pretty impressive climb up one of the walls by cutting footholds out of the
mud. I followed him and destroyed the footholds. Neither of us could fit through either.
of the two leads so we gave up. Both looking like the Swamp Thing, we returned to
the pit and got ready to climb. I don't want to talk about the knife-like lips the rope
was riding on as we climbed out.
: . There are at least two great things about surveying with Lawrence. One is the
camp stove, and the other is...oh I won't spoil it yet. The camp stove heats up your
Spaghetti-O's and warms your fingers. Despite being slimed, after eating our warm
meal we agreed to go on to 7 Second.
We twisted and turned our way towards 7 Second. For the sake of brevity I'm
leaving out the part about all the "ceiling leads" we stepped over on the previous trip.
We'll get them sooner or later....
.7 Second has at least two obvious holes to drop into. We had surveyed the left
drop previously, so when we arrived Steve rigged the rope and lowered it down the
other side. Bob will be pleased to hear that we used a different rig point than on the
first trip. Statistically, though, since neither one followed us down the pit, they both
were equally nice.
From a surveying point of view, the right side was much nicer than the left.
After some early confusion about where the points from the previous trip were located,
we managed to get a long plumb down to where I'd rappelled, about 15 ft or so from
the bottom. We wanted to verify that the sumps at the bottom of the left side of 7
Second, where we'd been on the last trip, connected to the sumps I was standing
above.
Steve and Lawrence dropped down, and then tossed me off the side of the
ledge we were on to find out what was what. I found cave art I'd left on the floor from
the previous trip, confirming the connection (a standard NSS approved survey
technique). I crawled through a hole and checked to be sure the sump was closed. I
was so hoping it would be open so I could swim some more, but it wasn't.
Since no part of my body had less than an eighth inch of greased mud coating
it, climbing out of the crack was a real blast. My knots, usually a rad-hip super-cool
neon green, were mud. They really didn't even feel like nylon anymore. Something
more like a cross between jello and refried beans. The beauty of knots, though, is
that no matter how uncomfortable they may feel, they don't slip. My mechanical
ascender, which prior to this trip had teeth on it, was not particularly impressive in its
