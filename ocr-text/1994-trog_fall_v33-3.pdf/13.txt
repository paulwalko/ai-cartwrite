Our schedule while in Frankfurt allowed very little free time. Alas, no cave trips. Taking an overnight train,
we arrived next in Budapest. We had written NSS member Dr. Kosa with the dates of our visit to Budapest.
Dr. Kosa wrote back with his phone number and said to call him when we got in and that he would make
arrangements to take us caving. When I called Dr. Kosa, he said that he had arranged his schedule so that
he could take us caving on Friday and would pick us up in his Russian-made car.
There are 3 commercial caves within the city limits of Budapest. Dr. Kosa first took us to Cave of Pal-Volgy.
The advantage of going with Dr. Kosa is that we did not have to pay to see the cave, since Dr. Kosa knew
the owners and was allowed to lead us on our own private tour. In fact, we were let into the cave ahead of
a group of school children, while cries of "American Cavers" filled the air (In Hungarian, of course!) Again
referring to literature from the cave:
"The cave was discovered in 1904 in a former quarry. It was opened to visitors in 1919 and
electric lighting was installed in 1927. The cave was thoroughly mapped in the 1980's and
comes to 6.5 kilometers, third longest among caves in Hungary. The tour covers 500 meters
of the cave which includes steps and ladders through narrow and high passages
characteristic of thermal caves. The tour takes you to a depth of 30 meters. The passages
are decorated by dissolvations, spherical cavities, spherical niches, and dripstone
formations."
We had great fun with Dr. Kosa in the cave, including trying to locate the light switches that turn on the next
section of lights. The lights are on a timer and we would occasionally get caught in the dark when we had
been talking about an unusual formation. Dr. Kosa is a geologist and has worked in some interesting places.
like Russia, Libya, Iraq, Cuba, and Colombia. Needless to say, we didn't ask too many details about his
work.
Â· The Cave of Pal-volgy has an entrance most cavers dream of. A concession stand sits on one side of the
entrance selling tickets, postcards, posters, books.... On the other side of the entrance is a bar. Dr. Kosa
bought us each a half-liter bottle of beer (about 30 cents a piece) to enjoy while we "rested up" for our next
trip. You know you are in good caver company when you can go caving for 45 minutes, come out and drink
inexpensive beer, all before 10am. You should realize that Hungarians (and most Europeans) consider beer
a food group. My kind of country!
Since Hungary has no drinking and driving laws, Dr. Kosa drove us 2-3 kilometers around the ridge to the
Cave of Szemlo-Hegy. Again we got a free individual guided tour of the cave. The Hungarian literature does
a far better job of describing this cave than I could.
"Experts qualify Cave of Szemlo-Hegy as one of the most beautiful examples of thermal-
water caves. Its high and narrow passages are richly covered by botryoidal "popcorns"
which were created by the thermal-waters. Although discovered in 1930, it has only recently
(1986) become a commercial cave. The total length of the cave is 2 kilometers.
Unfortunately the tour covers only a small but beautifully decorated section which can been
seen in 30-40 minutes."
The Cave of Szemlo-Hegy has several professional displays in their entrance foyer which describe the
geology, hydrology, and biology of the cave and other caves in Hungary, maps of several caves, and
descriptions of why caves need to be environmentally protected. The gift shop here is much larger and I
was able to obtain several books and posters.
Dr. Kosa showed us an unusual caver attraction that lay above the entrance to Cave of Szemlo-Hegy, the
Hungarian Caver Cemetery. It is a memorial to those who have died while caving. Each deceased caver is
represented by a piece of limestone inscribed with their name, date of birth and date of death. Dr. Kosa told
us several stories about how these deaths occurred. After listening, I came to the conclusion that there are
