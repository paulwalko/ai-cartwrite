In Kentucky constructive work is going on by protecting previously unprotected
hibernacula with bat-friendly gates and replacing bad-unfriendly ones on many caves,
including Dome (Coach) Cave which lost its once huge population of 100,000 Indiana Bats to
poor management. As of 1993 only 27 remained. Whether they bats will return to an again
friendly environment is yet to be seen.
In "Part II - State-by-State Trends" of this article [not yet available, but will be in the
next Trog if there's interest --Eds], I will discuss this and other current developments, some
good and some not so good, and put together the information concerning populations of the
Indiana Bat.
Nationally, even the military is taking heed of the plight of the bats and is converting
abandoned ammunition bunkers into useful bat habitat. These bunkers are "war hardened
structures" and much more stable than the collapsing mines.
On a world-wide scale, thanks largely to BCI, bats are now viewed by many as friends
and not "demons of the dark." Unfortunately, to many people, the old superstitions persist.
Recently, bats have been slaughtered in Arizona by ignorant hunters firing into a maternal
colony of "hateful vermin". In Mexico ranchers randomly destroying any bat confusing it for a
vampire bat that feeds on the blood of their cattle. The slaughter continues everywhere.
Even if we love bats (and cavers usually claim to), we can injure them out of carelessness
and ignorance. Bats need friends and in fact bats are our friends...
