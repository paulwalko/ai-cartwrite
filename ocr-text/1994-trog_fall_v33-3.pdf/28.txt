Wyandotte Cave, Crawford County, IN is a complex cave having over 10 km of
mapped passage. Still only 0.5 km served as usable hibernacula (all near the entrance). In
the 1950s, 15,000 Indiana Bats wintered here before a stone wall was installed at the
entrance. Again temperatures in the cave rose and the bat population declined to 1,460 by
1974. In 1977, the stone wall was removed, but the bat population has, at best, remained
constant.
Missouri's third largest hibernaculum, Pilot Knob Mine (an abandoned iron mine),
collapsed by natural causes. In 1960, the Indiana Bat counted at 71,800 and in 1980 33,000.
The largest known hibernaculum in Missouri is a mine which is in imminent danger of
subsidence threatening the largest population in the state (U.S. Fish and Wildlife, 1983).
In Kentucky (as of the 1983 Fish and Wildlife report) (U.S. Fish and Wildlife, 1983), the
state has the greatest decline of population of Indiana Bats since the 1960s (75%) due to
poorly designed cave gates which effect the microclimate of the cave. This 1983 report says
that Kentucky is doing the least to levitate the problems. I expect to be submitting a second
part to this article soon in which I will report on recent work being undertaken in Kentucky and
other states to help alleviate some of the problems.
In Illinois, most land has been "civilized" and converted to towns, industrial complexes,
agricultural land, and mining. Of the original coverage of forested areas (38%), little still
remains (12%) and most of that consists of replanted, secondary forest (Garner and Gardner,
1992). Streams and rivers have been channelized to eliminate the flood plains (remember the
floods of the summer, 1993 that taught us that the rivers can overcome our meager human
barriers?). The flood plains are gone (except for such exceptional flooding). Where will the
female Indiana Bats have their summer material colonies? Not many places.
Nationally we continue to deforest, build roads and towns, strip mine, and destroy the
habitat of all animals (except the human ones). We pollute with all kinds of toxins such as
insect and plant killing pesticides and herbicides (which endanger other animals and
ourselves, as well). Mother Earth has been an adaptable habitat for life, but can it take all
this indefinitely? Probably not!
HOPE:
In 1972, a joint symposium sponsored by the American Association for the
Advancement of Science (AAAS), the National Speleological Society (NSS), and the American
Society of Zoologists (ASZ) held a symposium entitled "Symposiumon Cave Bats: Their
Ecology, Physiology, Behavior, and Future Survival" (see NSS Bulletin 34, April 1972) (AAAS,
1972). The call-to-arms had been made to save the bats. Much work was and still is ahead
to understand the problem and to cure it.
Specifically to the survival of the endangered Indiana Bat are federally sponsored
plans by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service entitled "Recovery Plan for the Indiana Bat" dated
1976 (U.S. Fish and Wildlife, 1976) and revised in 1983 (U.S. Fish and Wildlife, 1983). Again,
action is underway, but its success depends upon all of us (especially on us cavers).
Missouri is doing more to preserve bat populations than elsewhere. Hopefully the
natural disasters that have occurred recently there and are expected in the near future may be
offset Ã¾y alternative plans (U.S. Fish and Wildlife, 1983). In Indiana, the population of Indiana
Bats seems to be holding its own (U.S. Fish and Wildlife, 1983).
In Illinois, the Illinois Department of Conservation, with which my grotto (Near Normal
Grotto, Bloomington-Normal, IL) and I am collaborating and assisting, has actively taken to
heart the survival of the endangered Indiana Bat. Happily, we can report that population
counts within hibernacula in north-central Illinois which had dropped to a third between 1956
and 1960 (350 to 120) have now climbed back up to 655 in 1993. While Illinois is not the
principal state for the Indiana Bat, we seem to be doing something right. Mainly correctly
protecting our hibernacula from intrusion during winter.
