Editors Plea
by Eileen & Laine (who else?)
Welcome to another exciting Trog. Thanks to all those who submitted stuff to fatten it
up and provide some education and/or amusement.
Hey, folks, don't be shy about submitting articles to the Trog. You don't need to be a
trainee to turn in a trip report, and if you have some opinions (and we're sure you do!)
on some good caver techniques, let everyone know. Who knows, someone may bind
it useful.
We were a bit low on trainees this semester, hence only a few trip reports. What this
cave club (and newsletter) needs is some fresh meat. Maybe we can make this new
semester an exciting one.
If you have any pictures, ideas, articles, or whatever for the Trog, you know who to
contact!
