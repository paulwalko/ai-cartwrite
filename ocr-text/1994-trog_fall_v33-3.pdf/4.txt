On Camera, Underground
by Carl Bern
As a person I am always attempting to experience and try new things (what about the
rest of us dogs? --Eds). This is why I decided to join the Smokehole trip going out on
October 21. Not only would this be my first time in Smokehole, but the purpose of the
trip was to attempt to videotape underground. Prior to this my main connection to
underground filming had been through the Disney Channel.
It was sometime in the afternoon when we finally assembled the entire group,
complete with videotaping equipment, at the Bat Ranch. The group consisted of Mike
Newsome, Big John Fulmer, Ray Sira, Eric Owen, Greg Frohn, and myself. The
equipment consisted of Mike's camera complete with a water-proof bag that can be
filmed through, two high powered electric lights belonging to Ray, and a large, foam-
lined plastic case for carrying the camera when we were not filming. The lights would
be the greatest limitation on the amount of filming we could do. Their batteries would
run out after roughly twenty minutes, long before the camera batteries would die.
We donned our cave clothes and were dropping into Smokehole not too long after.
We made our way to the place where you meet the stream for the first time and
decided to begin videotaping there. Mike stood with the camera at the bottom of the
slope that drops into the stream and the two high powered lights were held by people
positioned on either side of the slope. Mike then filmed myself and Greg making our
way down the slope. We then set up a number of other shots as we moved slowly
upstream. Each time we tried something different, changing the lighting, the
adjustments on the camera, the angle of the shot, etc. Finally, we packed up the
camera with the hopes of filming more when we got to the Big Room.
The only problem was that we could not find the Big Room. We scrambled around the
large breakdown pile and surrounding passages for about an hour pondering aloud
such subjects as how to get sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll into a caving movie. During
this time we sent Mike, as the only person wearing a wetsuit, into a partially
submerged passage in a section of the cave below the breakdown pile. After the trip
we found out that this was the passage to the Big Room, but when Mike has not found
the way after about five minutes we headed back up to search the breakdown pile for
another twenty minutes. After deciding that the cave gods did not want the Big Room
to be filmed on this particular day we chose to do the next best thing: film the water
exit.

After making our way to the start of the water exit we got out the camera and lights
one more time. Mike held the camera while Greg and Ray held the lights and we all
waded into the water. As usual the water was cold enough to take your breath away.
Then, as the floor sloped away beneath my feet I realized that this was the first time I
had ever been swimming underground. It's really nice to watch your cave pack
bobbing next to your head as you move downstream with the current. If I had still had
any feeling in my body at the time I probably would have floated there awhile and
enjoyed it longer. As it was I kept moving. I guess we were lucky that the water was
low on this particular day because no one had to duck under water to make it through
