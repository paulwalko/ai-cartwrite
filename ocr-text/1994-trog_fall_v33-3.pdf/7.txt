Caving Etiquette, or "Pardon me, may I use
your teeth as a foothold?"
by Mrs. Cartwright (A.I.'s mom)
While trying to relax at home, I've had many occasions to overhear you cavers
grumble and argue with each other. Oh, such language you use! Really, you need to
learn how to get along with one another. While underground it's absolutely essential
to keep the lines of communication open (and I need a decent night's sleep!). In order
to foster smooth relations, I've put together a few rules of etiquette which I think may
be helpful.
1. If you are hungry or need a rest, the proper thing to say is, "Could we please stop
a moment so I can catch my breath?" Please do not resort to having your last
word be, "Aaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh ...." because your limbs gave out over a
straddle pit. This tends to put a damper on the enjoyment of the other cavers on
the trip.
2. If a fellow caver uses the proper phrase in tip number one, the appropriate
response is, "Sure. Can you make it to the room just around this bend? It's a:
nice place to stop." An unacceptable reply: "Sure. I know a great place to stop.
We just have to climb this breakdown, cross a stream passage, chimney ten feet
up the wall, ease over a ledge, and crawl a few yards."
3. Knocking rocks onto a caver's head is generally frowned upon. However, we all
know there are times when one is left with no good alternatives. In this case, be
sure to use the appropriate call, "ROCK!", if not before the impact, then at least
some time before the victim loses consciousness.
4.
If you must kick someone in the face, please do so with the utmost care. It is
always polite to thank him/her afterwards, as in, "Thanks very much; pushing off
your teeth gave me just the extra boost I needed."
5. The human body does, occasionally, need to expel excess gas. There are times
when this is acceptable. Leading another through a tight crawl is not one of those
times.
6. Be sure to carry your own gear while caving. If you have another person haul
your supplies, the temptation for them to "accidentally" hand you a bottle of cave
water to drink may be too great. Most cavers have enough evil on their souls; . it is
not for you to add more.
7. If you plan to stumble over a ledge and mortally wound yourself, do so in a way
that makes for easy body removal. Falling in a hard to reach place is rather rude,
as it takes much longer for the other members to get to a beer.
Please keep these pointers in mind while you are underground with friends. Perhaps
they will remain that way. Happy caving!
