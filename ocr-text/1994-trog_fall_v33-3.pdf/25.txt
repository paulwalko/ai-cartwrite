PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS:
Typical adult Indiana Bats average about as follows (Fenton, 1992)(Hall, 1960)(x13):
Weight: 6.5 grams (males) & 7.2 grams (females)
Forearm Length: 35 to 41 mm.
Head & Body Length: 41 to 49 mm.
Wingspan: 220 to 320 mm. (note, the huge wing surface area to body size means that
they readily exchange heat with the surroundings and quickly heat up or cool
down to surrounding temperatures)
Lifespan: up to 20 years or more
Body Temperature: 35C (95F) when active; 4 to 8C (39 to 46F) when hibernating (can
hibernate up to 10C (50F)].
Heartbeat: about 400 beats per minute (active); 25 beats per minute (hibernating)
Food Supply: eat insects (a colony of 500 can consume about 250,000 mosquitoes
per hour when feeding (dusk to dawn).
Mating: Mating occurs in the late fall, but sperm remains dormant within the female
until she ovulates in the spring. Mating is not by mutual consent, but rather is physically
forced upon the female by the male (Fenton, 1992)(Hall, 1960). Last fall, Don Coons and I
witnessed a mating and Don called it "date rape." The male holds the female with his teeth
and wings while she tries to escape. Upon insertion, she finally settles down and submits to
the act which takes from 5 to 20 minutes.

WINTER HABITAT:
In late fall, Indiana Bats cluster (or "swarm") around hiberancula caves and mines
(never buildings) to fly in and out and feed voraciously on insects in preparation for their
hibernation. Mating often takes place at this time. To survive the winter months (often 6
months) they must gain about 25% of their body weight in fat reserves (a 7 gram bat must
gain weight to 8.8 grams). For some unexplained reason, some Indiana Bats, both male and
female, do not gain the needed body fat to hibernate and have been found to remain active ..
late into the winter. Many dead bats are found on the floor of the hiberating mines or caves
and are thought to be those that did not gain necessary fat reserves to. last out the long winter.
with no food (often up to six months) (Fenton, 1992)(Richter et al., 1993)(Tuttle, 1991).
A few Indiana Bats have settled down to a hiberatory life for the winter as early as.
September, but most wait until October and November. During hibernation, body temperature
falls to a few tenths of a degree of the surface rock on which they hang. The temperature
must be very low so that their metabolic rates are slowed enough to last through the winter.
Temperatures of 4 to 8C (39 to 46F) are ideal, but they can withstand temperatures up to
10C(50F). Humidity must be high to replenish water lost in respiration (usually 75% relative
humidity or higher). They do awaken periodically (every few weeks) to drink water (often
condensed on their fur), urinate, groom, and sometimes move to better temperature zones in
the cave or mine. They do not eat or defecate during hibernation and therefore there is never
a guano pile in the hibernaculum of an Indiana Bat (Barclay, 1983)(Hall, 1960).
Suitable hibernacula are infrequently found, since the temperature must be below the ..
usual cave or mine temperature which remain at the mean annual temperature of the region.
In the U.S., mean annual temperatures range from 12 to 20C (54 to 69F). In the Midwest,
caves and mines average 13C (56F) year round, which is too warm for hibernation. Only
caves and mines which cool off more than that in winter are suitable ("cold traps").
Hibernacula must have a way for cold winter air to flow in from outdoors, displacing ambient
air during the winter. Most such mines and caves have multilevel entrances so that warmer
air can exit an upper level while cold air enters a lower one (chimney effect) (Barclay,
1983)(Belwood and Waugh, 1991).
