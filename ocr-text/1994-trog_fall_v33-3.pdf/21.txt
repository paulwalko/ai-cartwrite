Practice Rescue from a Slightly Different Perspective
by Alison Williams
Who knows what made me do it that Friday night at the meeting, but I had to ask the.
question of who was going to be the victim (patient, sorry) for practice rescue. I know,
I know, I did volunteer so I really shouldn't whine; I just thought it would be interesting
to see practice rescue from a different perspective. I was getting a little apprehensive
as it got closer to rescue time on Saturday morning and wondering if I would regret
volunteering the night before. Amazingly enough, it was actually a very good
experience and my fears definitely lessened as the rescue proceeded.
As Capt. Ed, Leroy, and I went through Tawney's to get to the salt-petre room, I
noticed things in that cave that I had never really seen before. Every little obstacle
made me wonder how the rescuers were going to maneuver the stokes and just how
uncomfortable and/or anxious I would be while they were trying to get me around the
obstacle. But after getting to the accident spot, we had plenty of time to lounge
around for a while and discuss our most frightening caving accidents and near misses.
Anyway, after all the rescuers (cavers, friends, whatever...) got there, they did an
excellent job of tying me in the stokes from what I could tell. I definitely didn't think
that I was going to fall out. It was a different feeling only being able to see the cave
ceiling and bright lights that kept shining in my face. Not to mention that the rescue
goggles refracted the light of the lamps into a zillion different colors, which I am sure
would have been even neater with a little chemical enhancement. The ride in the
stokes was very smooth, which says a lot about the people who were carrying it..
could imagine how uncomfortable a ride in the stokes would be with an injury or with
people who weren't very careful.
.
There were only a couple of places were I held my breath, but I know it was a lot
more uncomfortable for other people to get me up through those tight spots (thanks to
everyone who donated their bodies :) ). My biggest fear was when I was eating food .
that people were feeding me and wondering what would happen if I choked.(those
little drink boxes definitely squirt when you squeeze them). In general, practice rescue
was great and except for the webbing constantly landing on my face, I have no
complaints. I know that in future years I will definitely be more considerate and gentle
with the stokes since I understand what it's like to ride in one. And, if I ever get
injured in a cave I will know what to do....... Walk or crawl out by myself.
