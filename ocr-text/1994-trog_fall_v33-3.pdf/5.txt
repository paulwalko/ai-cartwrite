the sump. From what I have heard that is the leap of faith one makes when leaving
Smokehole through the water exit. Soon we could smell the overpowering odor of
vegetation that marks the end of every summer cave trip (especially those summer
trips that occur in October --Eds). Before my feet had even ceased to be numb we
were back at the Bat Ranch critiquing the video we had made.
For anyone else trying to film underground here are some of the things we learned
from this experience.
- When in a cave your camera will be subject to damage from dust, water, mud,
bumps, and falls; think well on the precautions you must take to prevent such damage.
- Keep battery life in mind. The high-powered lights needed for filming underground
can drain batteries fast.
- Unless you have a tremendous amount of light, your subjects are going to need
their own personal light sources. The solution for preventing light trails on the film
would probably be to have the subjects use a directional electric light (such as a
Petzel Zoom) that can be angled downward, away from the camera. Â·
- When filming with the camera inside a waterproof filming bag, autofocus is your
enemy. As soon as some dirt or water gets on the outside of this additional lens the
camera will automatically focus on that instead of your subject.
- We seemed to have our best results with close-up shots; these also require less
lighting.
- A camera-mounted light would be an idea worth trying. We did not try it on this trip,
but it seems (in theory) that it would eliminate a lot of the excess shadows that result
from light hitting the subject at an angle to the camera's viewpoint.
