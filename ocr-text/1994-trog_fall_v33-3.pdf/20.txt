Well, the semester has come and gone again a little too quickly. Despite the lack of
lots of new trainees and old members doing things other than caving, the semester
has turned out pretty well. Meetings have been starting reasonably on time all
semester. Cave trips have not been as plentiful as I like to see. Hopefully we will be
getting a few new members from our trainee crop this year. There are not a whole lot
of them, but those few that are around will make good cavers.
Congrats to our one new member this semester, Carl Bern (#350). Hopefully there
will be a few more people getting their memberships. so we can have officers next
year.
Training people on vertical work has been difficult as always this semester without the
bridge. There never seems to be enough time to get two people out to the quarry to
play on rope. All three times that I made it out to the quarry there were never more
than four people out there. If anybody has any ideas where we can practice vertical
work in town, please let me know.
The club gear is worse for wear as always; we need to fix a few lamps up if anyone
has time to play with them.
Convention is coming up this summer and is keeping everybody busy doing various
tasks. There are still lots of things that need to be done if anybody has any extra
time.
On to better things, though. Thanks to Spotty Dog for taking care of Halloween; it was
a great party (yep, you know what's coming --Eds) as always. Much thanks to Hoss
for taking on Banquet. It will be a great banquet this year even if it is dry with the
post-banquet party at the Bat Ranch. Dave C., you did a great job pulling off the
Practice Rescue; thanks to Alison Williams for being the patient. The road out by the
Bat Ranch looked clean for awhile; thanks Steve. I am sure Amy will do just as good
a job with it next year.
