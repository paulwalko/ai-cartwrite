The Indiana Bat (Myotis sodalis) is found throughout the northeastern and central
United States. However, its population has shown an alarming decrease since population
surveys were first made in the 1960s. This species of bat was among the first mammals to
be recognized as endangered on the first Federal Endangered Species List of 1967 (U.S. Fish
and Wildlife, 1976, 1983, 1988). Since then, action has been taken to save this species from
extinction, sometimes successfully and sometimes not.
We should be reminded of what happened when we ignored the plight of an
endangered species in the past. In the 1800s, the Passenger Pigeon was very abundant in
the United States and it seemed unimaginable that we humans could significantly affect that
abundance (especially considering the limited population of humans in the U.S. at that time).
In 1815, a flight of about a billion Passenger Pigeons took three full days to fly across a
region of Kentucky. People shot them right and left and continued to destroy their habitat,
such that by 1900, they were rarely seen. By 1914, they were totally extinct (AAAS, 1972).
It is said that the Passenger Pigeon became extinct partly due to its low birthrate. An
adult female produced two young per year. Most bats, including the Indiana Bat, have only
one young per year. Danger of extinction? You bet!
In the following article, I will try to summarize the life-style of the Indiana Bat
(Myotis sodalis) and where it stands in respect to becoming "history."
ORDER, SUBORDER, GENUS, AND SPECIES:
Bats fall under the mammalian order of Chiroptera (meaning "hand wing"). They
are the only truly flying mammals. Others, like the flying squirrel, simply glide. There are
about 900 living species of Chiroptera in the world which accounts for almost a quarter of all
mammals on Earth (Fenton,1992)(Tuttle, 1988).
This order is subdivided into two suborders: Megachiroptera (large ones) and
Microchiroptera (small ones). Bats found in the United States are Microchiroptera.
The Indiana Bat falls under the genus Myotis meaning "mouse-eared" because of its
appearance. There are almost 100 species within this genus.
Bats are warm-blooded mammals and therefore northern bats must either migrate to
warmer climates or hibernate in winter. The Indiana Bat hibernates. Bats are one of few
mammals that "truly hibernate". Body temperatures fall to a few tenths of a degree above the
surroundings. A few bats can withstand freezing, but the Indiana Bat can't. They must
hibernate at a few degrees above freezing. Bears, squirrels, and such don't actually
hibernate. They just sleep for long times while maintaining their body temperatures at near
normal.
Finally, the Indiana Bat is classified under the species Myotis sodalis, or "mouse-eared
social bat." The term "social", no doubt, stems from their habit of hibernating in huge clusters,
making them extremely vulnerable to attack and extinction.
Many Myotis bats look alike. The Little Brown Bat (Myotis lucifugus) is the most
common here in the mid-west. It is easily mistaken for the Indiana Bat (Myotis sodalis), but
has entirely different roosting habits. The Little Brown Bat likes to roost in buildings near
water. As we shall see, the Indiana Bat doesn't live in houses. If you have bats in you attic
(or belfry), they aren't Indiana Bats (Garner and Gardner, 1992),
