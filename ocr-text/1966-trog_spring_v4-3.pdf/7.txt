HANK'S FOLLY

After participating in surveying some portions of the extensive
Greenbrier System, I became aware of the great need for dependable com-
munications between separated survey groups. At first, the problem of
designing a device which would allow voice communication over a mile
underground seemed impractical. The diverse structure of the cave would
tend to absorb and scatter almost any type of electromagnetic propa-
gation. Other problems like size, mobility, and ease of operation,
certainly would not aid in the design of the device.
A few prominent cavers expressed their interest in a cave walkie-
talkie to the extent that my enthusiasm got the best of me. I first
read some short articles on perfected cave radios in the "Baltimore
Grotto News!. The articles were entirely devoted to hi-intensity D.C.
field communication that was used for surveying primarily surface to
sub-surface topography. The equipment seemed heavy and awkward and did
not allow for voico communication; therefore, the material was not much
help to me.
The operating frequency of the walkie-talkie would be the most
important feature. The success of the transceiver would depend pri-
marily on the lowest frequency that could be practically used. I chose
one megacycle which would put the walkie-talkie in the middle of the
broadcast band. This particular choice has its definite advantages. Al-
most everyone has a transistor B.C. receiver and could use it when sur-
veying. Also, the F.C.C. would not frown on radiating in the middle of
the broadcast band since the law provides for the use of low power
transmitters in this band.

After establishing the most economical, practical, cperating
frequency for the walkie-tall-ic, it was not long before I had a proto-
żype in operation. It weighed approximately four pounds, measured
811x51*3", and transmitted with a power input of three watts for one hour
and received for seventy-two hours continuously. The device could be
held in one hand, or could be strapped to a person's arm. It was com-
pletely self-contained, including batteries. The device that was built
was just right for the lost caver, except for one item; the antenna.
The shortest antenna for ceasonable efficiency is one-fourth
the wave length of the operating frequency. At ono megacycle, the an-
tenna would then have to be about two-hundred and thirty feet long.
For obvious reasons, no matter how small and mobile the walkie-talkie
was, it would be vory impractical for caving. I spent some time trying
various configurations of antennae and the best I could do was a nine-
foot whip that was conter loaded with a loading coil twice the size and
weight of the walkie-talkie. My project was therefore abandoned but I
would like to inform the reader before I close, that the radio did per-
form very well when tested in.cave conditions with the large antenna.
Therefore, if some energetic, resourceful individual can come up with a
short, short radiator for one megacycle, I would be very interested in
· using it for the cave radio.
