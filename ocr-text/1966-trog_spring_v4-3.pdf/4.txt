with projects underway in Cauliflower, Fallen Rock, Chimney, and Higgen-
botham's #2 Caves. In Pulaski County 50-Foot Hell Cave has been mapped
with a project underway in James Cave which has now topped a mile.
Pulaski County projects are in conjunction with the New River Valley
Cave Club, which have included the discovery and exploration of many
new caves in that area. In Bland County, more precisely in the New-
berry-Bane's system, three projects are presently underway: Coon
Cave is being mapped; the lower section of Penley's is being mapped with
about 1,500 new feet of passage surveyed; and Bane's Spring is being
surveyed with 5,000 new feet mapped and another 1,000 known to exist in
addition to the "old": 1,750 feet. In Roanoke County, Miller's Cove Cave
has finally been completed with 2.5 total miles surveyed. In West
Virginia, no careful record has been kept of what VPI people have done
in conjunction with WV√ÅCS and others, but they have played an impor-
tnat part in not only exploring and mapping, but in scientific work as
well. Walt Allen Cave in Pocahontas County was mapped during Winter
quarter.
Aside from mapping and exploration, VPI has practiced rescue
techniques and various individuals have made improvements in equipment
design, led cleanup projects to local caves, and worked on a club journal.
How does VPI manage all this? There must be clubs with as many
members and as many cars. There must be clubs as close to the caves
as VPI. How can VPI claim the undisputed title of "World's Most Active
Caving Organization"? In my personal opinion it all boils down to one
thing: individual enthusiasm. There are those caving organizations
that pride themselves in being organized on a team effort. For example,
this recent appalling statement was found in an Eastern newsletter:
"In the Grotto everyone receives a measure of responsi-
bility and learns the true meaning of teamwork as a vital part of a
disciplined, well-functioning group. The Grotto is never a group of
individuals but a single body in which each part must rely on the others
for its safety.!!
In the VPI Grotto, one learns quickly to be an independent,
self-sufficient individual. Members initiate and coordinate their own
projects and trips. Our safety code is nominal, as members are usually
intelligent enough to realize that basic safety does not spring from
subjective rules, and that, just as they are individuals, so is each
situation. VPI cavers commonly know enougin to view each of these si-
tuations objectively and deal with it according to his own capabilities.
Just as enthusiasm drives the VPI caver, .common sense makes him safe.
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Let us hope that this
journal never has to print anything such as this:
"At the November meeting a motion was passed stating that
all Grotto members would be required to wear a hard hat of anspecified
design to better the appearance of the Grotto uniform...!!
I personally hope that this journal will be as great as the
VPI Grotto.
