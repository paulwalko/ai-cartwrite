If there is any caving organization around that likes to blow its
own horn, it's the VPI Grotto. Into the Editor's Column of the Tech Trog-
lodyte many boasts and harangues find their way, and this one is no ex-
ception.
As most years have been for the VPI Grotto, this one has been
very successful. The signs of success are upon the Grotto, not the least
of these being the fact that for the last three months the Club treasury
has been too depleted to support another issue of this august journal.
Where has all our money gone? Carbide uses up a lot of it since the club
consumes it at the rate of more than 100 pounds per quarter. Under nor-
mal conditions this amount of carbide would represent from 2000 to 3000
hours underground.
What kind of caving do we do to burn up all that carbide? Many
weekends see droves of VPI cavers head for the Greenbrier area where they
meet with WVACS and others to explore and survey large cave systems.
Other groups migrate to some of the untouched areas in Southwestern Vir-
ginia to find new caves and map the larger ones. There are groups who
are active in the Butler-Sinking Creek System and other areas through-
out Virginia and West Virginia. Then, of course, there are many short
trips to local caves for photography, training new members, rigging prac-
tice, or just for fun. It all adds up to a staggering amount of man-
hours spent underground every weekend. Some idea of this can be obtained
by standing behind the SAB at 1:00 Olclock" and watching the Grand Central
Station situation develop. as cavers begin to congregate, go to the
storeroom for carbide, test ropes, stow equipment into car trunks, ex-
amine vertical gear, talk, throw snowballs, etc. A few stragglers come
puffing up from the Lower Quad toting laundry bags and helmets, cars
start and leave, "Let's get going", "Wonder where so-and-so is?", "Here
he comes", and so it goes. After a while one begins to marvel at how
VPI can stretch a hundred pounds of carbide so that it will last three
months.
Of course, the new brunton was a big expense also. A number of
years ago, the club owned one brunton. But few people ever used it.
Now we own two of them, and it is a good idea to "sign up" for one
several weeks in advance if you want to get any surveying done.
Individual members have made great financial outlays, also.
Last spring, members purchased a total of 3,600 feet of goldline. It
seems that this would saturate the market in this area, but this spring
another 2,400 feet was purchased. Among other equipment purchased by
individuals were five sets of jumars.
So, VPI does a lot of caving. What have they to show for it?
Have they produced any results? The answer is an emphatic "yes". The
results are strongest in cave mapping. In the past year maps have
been completed of Steelo's Cave and Ward Cove Cave in Tazewell County,
