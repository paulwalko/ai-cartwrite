SPRING PROJECT - TAZEWELL COUNTY, VIRGINIA
April 30, 1966.
Water, water everywhere, especially in the caves. This was the
theme of theVPI Grotto Spring Project in Tazewell County. This project,
whose main objective was to nap Higginbotham's No. 2, was planned for
Winter quarter but was postponed because of lack of transportation.
This quarter transportation was not a problem with three cars going this
time. However, we did have one small, insignificant problem - Water.
As of the Sunday before the project, the weather had been perfect for
caving. The last significant rainfall had been in the last part of
February. However, on Monday it rained. On Tuesday it rained. On
Wednesday it rained. On Thursday it rained. On Friday morning it
rained. For those who have not been to Higgenbothan's No. 2, it is
not a good idea to go into the cave when it is raining or if there is
a possiblility of a hard rain. Therefore, there was considerable doubt
when the three cars left about noon Saturday as to what we would be
doing.
Thusly, with 120 feet of ladders, 600 feet of nylon rope, a lot
of hope, and no sense, we headed to No. 2. Just as we arrived it started
raining, and raining, and raining. As a result we decided to pass up
Higginbotham's No.:2. The Armstrong and Marshall cars went to Ward Cove
Cave to deposit camping gear and the Thorne car headed for Chimney Rock
Cave with 2000+ feet needing exploration and mapping. They found and
explored 1000 feet of new cave. In the process they got wet and did
not do any mapping. They returned to Blacksburg after leaving the cave.
The Armstrong and Marshall cars went to Cauliflower Cave and mapped
1000 feet before running out of dry passage. They then returned to
Ward Cove Cave where they spent the night. At that time it was still
raining. On Sunday Tazewell County was returned to the Rain Gods, and
the group went to Dead Air Cave in Smyth County.
Thus the only accomplishments of the project were the finding of
1000 feet of new cave in Chimney Rock Cave and the mapping of 1000 feet
in Cauliflower Cave.
We had several problems, but by far the biggest one was the
rain. This was one problem about which we could do nothing. Not only
did it limit the extent of our caving, but more importantly it had a
demoralizing affect on the participants. Another problem was the
planned meeting of the two groups. The original purpose of the meeting
was for the Armstrong-Marshall group to help the Thorne group finish
mapping Chimney Rock and to pick up the other brunton for use on Sun-
day. However, the Thorne group got wet finding the new section and,
because they were wet and cold, decided not to wait for the Armstrong-
Marshall group. Again, if it had not been raining this connection
would have been made.
So be thinking about a spot for the Fall Project and plan to
attend. (Also hope for nicer weather)
