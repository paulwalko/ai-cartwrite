THE VPI SPOTLIGHT
: Ever notice how your trusty carbide lamp chooses to betray you
when there is neither time nor place to discipline it? Like dangling
above 200 feet of solid air? Don't throw it away! Just build the VPI
Epotlight for a quick, bright, no-funbling substitute!
With the Spotlight, you have the advantages of both types of
light: steady, economical flame or sharp, instant beam. It is much
brighter than a penlight and less bulky than a miner's lamp. A shock
mount protects The Spotlight from all but the worst, and brim mounting
leaves the hands free. The weight increase is quite small.
(See Hardhat Detail)
Four manganese (alkaline) penlight batteries supply the power,
selected for their longer output per unit weight and size, as well as
economy, over the zinc-carbon battery. A series-parallel configuation
'yields three volts for more than twice as long as just two batteries.
Use of a low current, three volt bulb, such as the PR-6, lengthens the
time, also.. A PR-4 may be substituted at a sacrifice in time and the
PR-2 drains too quickly.

Construction: The Spotlight itself is made from the flashlight head.
Remove the lens and reflector. Drill small holes for the 1/16 inch
connection screws in the metal shield and the bulb retainer. Insert
the screws and tighten with the nuts. Drill a hole for the support
screw just behind the lens and reflector positions. Insert the sup-
port screw and a washer and tighten with a nut and washer. Reinsert
the lens and relector, trimming their edges if necessary. Seal the
head by filling the cavity in the head with filling compound, smoothing
it over, . Observe curing time.
(See Bulb Retainer Clip)
Cut the small loop off the curtain hook and bend the ends about
3/811 in. Drill two holes laterally opposite in the head, behind the
reflector. Spring the curtain hook clip to fit. It should secure the
bulb retainer by fitting in a small carved notch.
(See Brim Support Detail)
Drill a hole in the hat brim, larger than the support screw, to
allow flexing. Put a grommet above and below and mount the Spotlight
with a large washer and two nuts locked against each other so as to
hold firmly while permitting the Spotlight to push back against the hat.
