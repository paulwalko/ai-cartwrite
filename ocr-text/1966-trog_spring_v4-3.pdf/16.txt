FIFTY FOOT HELL CAVE
59. Foot Hell Cave is located just north of Route 11 between
Radford and Dublin in Pulaski County, Virginia (Radford quadrangle,
C 4/3/5, Lat. 37008'07", Long. 8003813511). It was discovered on
October 29, 1965 by Ed Morgan, Bob Lewis, and Dan Lewis while looking
for some other leads.
The entrance, which is quite tight, is located in a small sink
in a ravine 200 yards ENE of Mr. C.W. Nye's house. The cave, basically
one passage trending ENE, roughly parallels Route 11. The cave is
quite muddy in spots. The name of the cave comes from a very tight
50-foot crawl at the end. The crawl averages 13 feet wide and 2 feet
high. The sides are very rough and there are numerous pools in ito
(In other words, pure Hell!) At the end of the crawl it narrows down
slightly. More cave can be seen but it is impossible to get by this
spot without the use of Inčtant Cave. A very slight breeze was de-
tected at this spot.
The cave was mapped on November 6, 1965 by Ed Morgan (VPI,
New River Valley Cave Club), Bob Lewis (NRVCC), Dan Lewis (NRVCC) and
Harry Johnson. The entire cave was mapped with a total length of
1360 feet, making it the third largest cave in Pulaski County. It
ranks behind James Cave (Ferrall's Cave) with 6000 feet and Southern's
Cave with 1400 feet.
