PROGRESS REPORT OF THE VIRGINIA CAVE SURVEY
By John R. Holsinger, Director, Va. Cave Survey -- Dept. of Biology
East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, Tennessee,
37601.
(Editor's Note: This report has been revised and updated
by the editors of this journal since its first appearance
in the D.C. Speleograph.)
The following report is a brief summary of all new data collected
on Virginia caves since the summer of 1962 (cut-off point for material
published in the Caves of Virginia). The caves listed in my last pro-
gress report ("A resume of the information collected on Virginia caves
since 1962" -- published in several regional newsletters in 1965) are
included herein in order that all supplementary data can be brought to-
gether in one place. The present report has been prepared for three
reasons: (1) to up-date all recent, pertinent data on Virginia caves,
(2) to serve as a guide to those persons working on the Survey, and (3)
to prevent duplication of work which has been comp) sted or is in pro-
gress.
A reorganizational meeting of the Virginia Cave Survey was
held in conjunction with the 1965 Virginia Region Meeting in
Blacksburg, and at that time a number of areas needing survey work
were assigned to volunteers. Another meeting of those interested
in assisting with the Survey was held in conjunction with the
Region meeting this year (fall of 1966) in Charlottsville,
Since the summer of 1962, new data have been compiled on caves
in 19 counties of Virginia. A number of major caves have been
mapped cr are in the process of being mapped, and a total of 135
new caves have been recorded. All caves for wliich any new information
is available are included in the following list. Those caves denoted
by an asterisk are now to the Survey. No attempt has been made to
present lengthy or detailed descriptions in this report. Detailed
data and maps will be published in the proposed "Supplement to the
Caves of Virginiall which is tentatively scheduled for publication
in 1970. Anyone interested in working on the Virginia Cave Survey
should contact me directly.
