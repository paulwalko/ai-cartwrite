her own. We were all very cold and wet and the blankets provided
by the rescue squad were appreciated.
Fortununatey no one was hurt, no one caught pneumonia, and
I haven't even heard of any colds. It makes the rescue look like
a false alarm and is embarrassing at least to myself. It happened
to be, however, better to be embarrassed that nothing happened,
than to be sorry that something did and no help was available.
The lesson to be learned involves decisions made before we
got out of the car. It seems apparent now that we should have:
1) had someone who knew the cave well, who would
have advised against going down the lower drop with the cold water,
2) known better than to go to a new cave on such
a lousy day,
3) in short, used better judgement.

VPI CAVE CLUB FALL PROJECT
or
HOW WE FAILED TO COLLAPSE NEWBERRY - BANES
Personnell :Mallory Hightower, John Smith, Richard Beck
We entered the cave at approximately 4:00 pm as a part of the
Fali Quarter Cave Club' Project, Due to the near position of Penley's
Cave to Newberry -Bane, it was believed possible that the two caves
may be made one system' by blasting in the appropriate places. We had been
given the possible sites to blast and were carrying sixteen sticks
of dynamite to make good our threat.
The first position was located near the bottom of Bill's
Rappell. Canyon. We did not have enough rope to r√°ppet the 175 foot
drop, go we had to look for the alternate route, the Devil: Staircase.
We managed to find a small openning which we imagined to be the
ane that we were looking for. We descended and followed the passage
but it did not terminate in the bottom of the 175 foot
pit, sto we returned. Some fellow members kindly showed us the
proper point of descent. However we were too tired to do a proper job
sa we decided it was best to return to the surface. We chimneyed out
at approximately 2:00 a.m, Sunday, thoroughly enraged at not having been
able to blow up anything.
