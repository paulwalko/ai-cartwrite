To get to Lowmoor Cave, tiake. U.S. Route 260 towards Roanoke,
then take U.S. Route 220 north to Clifton Forge. From Clifton
Forge, take Interstate 64 west for four miles until you come to
State Route 616. Turn left off of Route 616 into Lowmoor and then
turn right at the first paved road. Drive on until you pass the
town and then look for an old bridge on the right-hand side of the
road. The cave entrance is about four hundred yards up and around
the hill. The cave can also be entered through the quarry either by
a one hundred foot vertical drop or by an old truck ramp. I suggest :
looking for the cave entrance as it is very easy to keep walking
in circles when inside the quarry.

We left Blacksburg at 10:30 on Saturday, March 5th, ate lunch
in Clifton Forge, and entered the cave at 1:30. When we first entered
the cave it appeared to be a very wet cave. It turned out that the
puddles and profuse dripping were unique to the entrance chamber, The
rest of the cave was very dry, `thus making the temperature seem
much higher than it really was.
The half of the cave that we saw was entirely walking passage.
The solutional form of these passages created a very interesting *
rock formation in which many interesting and beautiful photographs
could be taken with different colored lights. The larger of these
passages are actually long rooms, but this is not easily seen
because of the formations which greatly limit one's ability to look
straight down the room. This section of the cave, the upper section,
is connected to the lower section by a vast maze chamber.
The lower section of the cave is the most beautiful because
of the many calcite formations . Many of these high grade calcite
formations are broken and crushed, and literally cover the floor.
In the lower section of the cave, I am told, there is an extensive
crawling passage that is completely covered with crushed calcite.
This passage could be very grueling and painful if a person was not
wearing heavy pants and shirt, as the broken calcite is very sharp
and cannot be evaded.
After reaching the half way mark of the cave (where the
crushed calcite crawl begins), we decided not to continue along the
main passage and began to poke around in some of the many sideâ€œ
passages, 'While doing this, Dave Strope found two hundred yards in
of virgin, chimney passage ( undisturbed manganese dioxide deposits on
the dirt walls indicated that the passage was virgin). After an
hour and a half of sticking our heads into whatever looked like
it might go somewhere, we started out. Instead of going out through
