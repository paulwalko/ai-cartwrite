Dear Gary,
Mighty glad to see the article on the new work in Newberry-
Bane and Penley's. My previous information was somewhat incorrect;
I heard that a connection to Penley's had been made.
Below are a few changes to the West Virginia cave list (mostly
from John Rutherford, WVACS on December 10, 1965).
The Hole ------------ Mapped 5 miles, explored 10 miles.
McClungs ---------- Mapped 9.5 miles, explored 10 miles.
Ludington ---------- Mapped 4 miles, explored 5 miles.
2 entrances ------- Mapped.
Benedict --
Mapped 1 mile.
Hunt Cave -------- Mapped 1.85 miles, explored 1.85 miles
(9700 feet).
I think this is all of Hunt, might be able to push a second
entrance. ::Quite atlot of trash digging.
Sincerely,
/s Earl Thierry
P.S. Any of map of New River yet?
