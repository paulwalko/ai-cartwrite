LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
May 1, 1966
Dear Sir:
:
I would have sent this directly to the NSS NEWS but thought
you'd like it since VPI has always been first to realize the potential
of a new method. Zeke Fuller and I have been working with the
"rappelender" which first appeared in the April 1966 NSS NEWS. We
have had trouble with transmogrification of the pseudo-curvilinear
trigonometric insert, which was probably caused by the counter-
clockwise rotation of the rope while descending.
We have tried several different kinds of locking devices to
arrest this transmogrification and have found a simple ambihedral
hexnut to be about the safest thing on the market. The main safety
feature lies in the design of the init, which must be fully screwed on
before it can be screwed off.
Diagram enclosed.
Yours truly,
/s/ Paul Helbert
