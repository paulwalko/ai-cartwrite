the underground quarry. This quarry has a ceiling about eighty feet
in height and is supported by fifty-foot-in-diameter pillars. We
got out of the cave at 9:30 and got back to Blacksburg, safe and
almost sound, at 12:00 (AI, who was at the wheel, dozed off twice).

• We arrived at the quărter mile path to the Murder Hole at
about 4:30 in the afternoon, Stopping at Mr. Bell's house there on
Route 600, we were told that the cave owner' lived on the other side
of the mountain. We checked two other houses on the other side and
found one where the people felt they had the authority to let us
enter the cave. I emphasize that permission was obtainedo
It was cold and rainy. The path to the sink was under six
inches of slush and my boots were wet before entering the caver:
Ropes were tested, andps rigged in acceptable fassion, and
rappels were made first down the 120 foot incline to the cave
entrance and, once in the cave, into a large room. The second drop

were sent up the rope but it was too cold to work in the stream
of ice water.
Rick Keener nade it up after me. By this time my light was
going and I decided to go back to the car for the dry clothing.
From the time that my light first went out I had a growing suspicion
that failure to get help might risk one of the party getting in
serious condition from llexposure!. We know that it has happened
before and that at least one person has died from similar causes.
Thus, I felt it was proper to call the rescue squad even though there
was no person trapped or with injury: it seemed better to be safe
than sorry later,
The rescuers arrived with ropes, lights, a generator, and
other rescue apparatus. This was approximately 11:30 or 12:00,
Every member of our party was capable of climbing out on his or
