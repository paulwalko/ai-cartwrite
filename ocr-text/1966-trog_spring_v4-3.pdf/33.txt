Thanksgiving weekend, 1965, gave me the opportunity to do some
work with the Virginia Cave Survey in Lee County, Virginia. Ed Bauer
and I left Wednesday after classes in che very tightly packed
Volkswagen for Pennington Gap, GHQ for that particular weekend.
I caved with him on Thursday and Friday, but on Saturday we went our
separate ways. I heard that he was going to cold and wet Surgeneris
Cave, but I had already had enough cold and wet caving for that
weekend (Indian Cave) so I went to nice, warm, and dry Ewing Saltpeter.
To describe Ewing Saltpeter Cave (also known as Jones Salt-
peter) in one or two words would be impossible, but three will.
suffice. It is basically just ONE HUGE ROOM. On visiting the cave,
one can't help but get the impression that the hill in which the cave
is located is just one big bubble. With a cave that big, and a hill
that small, what else could it be?
.. The group entered the cave at about 10 A.M. The short entrance
passage leads down into a rocm abcut 50' in diameter and a ceiling
height of about 101. From this entrance rocm, a walking passage
leads straight ahead for about 100'. . This passage enters the big room
near the top, and a rope is needed for the descent to the flcor.
