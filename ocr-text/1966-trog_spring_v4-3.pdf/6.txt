IFK
All connections should be soldered or screwed down. As illus
wtrated, use terminals and sleeves on the lamp, if possible. Cover
all exposed connections with a thin coat of nail polish for protection.
(See Switch Detail)
The switch connections are soldered and protected with sleeves-
or use nail polish. The mount is an angle bracket trimmed to about
11x3/81163/811 drilled to take the switch. Drill a hole for a 3/22"
screw in the hat and mount the angle and the switch. The switch toggle
should be just under the rim of the hat.
(See Battery Detail)
The battery clip is wired and soldered as illustrated with two
leads coming from the 11th and 11-11 terminals. The batteries are tied
in with a string. The clip is in a plastic bag and supported in the
top of the hat by a layer of foam padding.
(See Wiring Detail)
The wiring is straightforward. Should one desire the option
of increasing the length of operation by adding an extra battery pack,
carried on the belt, just use a spdt switch and a pair of binding posts
at the back. Another switch, either on the hat or on the extra pack,
would turn the light on and off.
