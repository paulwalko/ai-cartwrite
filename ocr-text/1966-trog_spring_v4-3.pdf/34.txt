From the entrance room, another passage leads off to the left.
This duck-walk passage goes for about 100', coming out at the top
of a wooden ladder. The ladder leads down into a small room, from which
there are at least two passages leading to the large room. One
passage enters the big room at the floor level under the first pas-
sage ( the one that requires the rope) and the other one enters the
big room along the left side at the floor level.
The floor of the huge room is mostly clay and dirt, but
there are also a lot of rocks and pieces of break-down. At one point
along the left side of the room, immense pieces of break-down form
a series of small maze passages. At one point, the cave floor
gives way to a large crater. This is about the most difficult
part of an otherwise easy cave, and it requires a little climbing.
There seem to be quite a few passages leading off from the room,
but we made no effort to push them. There are very few formations in
the cave; the ones that are around are mostly dried up and crumbly.
All in all, Ewing Saltpeter is a very impressive cave from the stand-
point of its size, and yet it is a very easy cave.
After John Schelleng took some measurements, and George
Titcomb took some pictures, we headed out. After poking out in some
small holes on the other side of the mountain, we headed back to
Pennington Gap to tell of our adventures.
GIANT CAVERNS

Giant Caverns is a large cave in Giles County, near Narrows,
Virginia, At one time, it was commercialized, but after the collapse
of the commercial entrance it was deemed unsafe for normal people and
was left to demented cavers. One now enters the cave by rappeling
down a 70 foot sinkhole, the last 20 feet of which is free-fall.
The cave contains about 1100 feet of passage, much of which is con-
tained in one large room. This room measures 600 feet long by
120 feet wide by 40 feet high, and is thought to be the largest
single room of any cave in this part of Virginia. The cave is very
impressive in the variety and beauty of its formations. The scattered
remains of wooden steps, evidence of the commercial use of the cave,
was abundant. We approached the former entrance of the cave and
found the ceiling to be of rotten clay which crumbled easily at one's
touch. We returned to the sinkhole entrance, and with a VPI survey
party which had ccme in after us, climbed and/or prussiked out.
Summary: Giant Caverns constitutes good practice for the caver
just beginning his vertical work, as it is an easy rappel and prussik.
It is also a good cave for cave photography, as its formations are
both numerous and beautiful. It could aptly be called a "Sunday
afternoon cave".
