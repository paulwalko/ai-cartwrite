Don't give anything to Brian Wol-
ford.
In fact, don't let him anywhere near your stuff.
If you're thinking of showing off your weird
Mexican finds, announcing "hey look what
weird shit they were selling in a Mexican gas
station”, don't. Particularly if it happens to be
“Energy Sex Plus”. He will snort it. If you
should happen to do this and he should happen
to snort it (as the usual chain of events with
Brian goes) try to avoid him. You may try to
hide behind Alice but not even impregnable
Alice will suffice. Nor will boob guard globe
halves. But most importantly don't give him
your coat. He may take off his pants. And
then, so long as he's cross dressing, he'll put
on a Disney princess dress way over two sizes
too small which you will somehow feel the
likelihood to emulate until you rip free like the
hulk (if the hulk happened to be Snow White).
It's like “If You Gave A Mouse A Cookie” on
crack. If you happen to find you razor in the
microwave and Dustin's chair and fan out the
window next morning, just remember where it
all started and remember: Brian likes his
Pokemon. You fuck with his Pokemon puzzle
He's taking over the world
you fuck with him. As a last reminder make
(as symbolized by that globe)!
sure to keep your cows away from him. He'll
chase them with his pants down. Last thing you want is to have to hire a counselor for your
cow. (They're already traumatized enough with picnic and all)

John Bowling is fairly stocky;
It's hard to knock him down. You could try 10 times and still end up on the ground every time,
or even, in a river. You can call him a pussy as you do so. It won't necessarily help. Then
again, it may help if you're bigger than a rather small sized girl.
Alice is drunk.
You just don't know it.
Be inspirational! Use random shit to give life to the party!
Just because a party is once again at the cave club suite doesn't mean it's the same old party. If
random packages from Hawaii come for Kaitlyn Hart and those packages happen to contain a
neon Taz the Tazmanian Devil hat, even that wtf item can be put to use. Now you have a con-
ductor hat! Put on, pull off a dance move, and the crowd will follow. The robot or, better yet,
The Ethan or, especially, The Ray, are recommended dances. The tackling dance is not.
