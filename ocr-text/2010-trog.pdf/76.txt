This year the fire was done with
firework accompaniment. It was a
slow burning fire so when Ethan
and Mark were leaning against it
later they found a couple fireworks
go off around their heads.
There was an awesome dance floor
which had laser lights and tables
that we danced on until we literally
broke them. Surprisingly we were
still allowed to dance.
We did “The Ray” dance. (Last
year he had a flashing bat light
necklace)
We were well looked after- A ran-
dom group of men woke Lauren
and John asleep by the fire to tell
them the risk they faced of hypo-
thermia adding to John to “take
care of his woman”.

No Kirk this year to play guitar
unfortunately :(
We learned what 2 plus two
equals.
