12 The trip will start off pleasant; you will soon lose your name and have it replaced with a name of similar lettering, for example Matt to Mike. See the resemblance? Neither do I. Be patient with the other people calling you Mike. Realize that they are on this trip as well and are empirically showing that they lack all form of intelligence. You reach the first waterfall. Not bad. You have spirited images of yourself rappelling down a gushing torrent of white water enough to snap the spine of a small animal or small man, but guess what, instead you get to take a semi-sketchy walk over the falls and rappel a good twenty feet from it. But if you make a whoosh sound as you rappel it may seem cool. While you’re at this place make sure to ask D.A.V.E. C. how they first rigged this drop; it’s a good story. At the bottom of the drop you take a nice little trip around some passage and then get to choose up or down. Do not go up (D.A.V.E. C will), but go down, it’s much better. Don’t lose your light on the crawl through. It’s not good m’kay. You than get to another fun rappel… After some pleasant mud the con- sistency of shit it looks like you get another little waterfall drop. This time you actually get into the waterfall! Exciting, right? No. It’s not. This is a trickle, (I would suggest the whoosh noise again for dramatic affect) but it’s also a good time to have not pissed off anyone. But I dare you to piss D.A.V.E. C. off early and see the great results when you get there. After stepping ginger- ly across the river to avoid the water, you take a steep ascent up to a little hole in the wall. There is no pizza here but a sump of muddy water. A little digging and it will seem that your trip is over as you go do everything you just did but in reverse! Yes, up the “pits” and all. As it turns out, you are going to do the same thing twice more. You go down another pit, (the crap end goes down the pit) and you have a pleasant walk to your destination. The belly flop. You will be given the chance to wuss out. Don’t, if you do than you lose all credibility and it means you never read the rest of my paper (Jerk). So you agree. Besides that’s what you came here for. And in you go. You find yourself in a small pas- sage where you slip like an eel to the sump. Dave will go first (thank god). Tip: make sure the spare light on your helmet is secure (if anyone finds a Wal-Mart LED at the bottom, it’s mine and I want it back. I believe Rob has an Apex there as well). The water here is cold, just re- member that you are the bigger piece of matter (you have deposable thumbs) and take it like a man. Don’t go rushing in, it’s not good, but stay calm for more fun is ahead. Once thru the twenty foot swim/crawl, you slither down to another sump. This one is a few feet long, but on- ly two or three feet tall, with barley enough air above. If you need to be pulled thorough don’t do it fast. Your head will go under the water and you’ll be several shades browner than you were before. Now starts the fun part of the trip. If you brought a spare change of clothes you want to have left them at the river, before the time that you went back up. Change, and do everything you did before the crawl. Up the “pits” through the passage and up the long agonizingly long borehole. Pray that it’s warm out- side, because your body is drained and near hypothermia. Why, you ask, would anyone go on this trip? Even more pressing, why would D.A.V.E. C. lead this trip multiple times?! What psy- cho did you get to take you into the mountains! But you’ll soon realize why it’s worth it. I can tell you with a straight face that Starnes was a great trip, it offers challenges that you don’t get from the frequented sport caves. It is painful only because of the cold, while many places are painful due to the actual pain that a sharp rock can give you. The trip is rewarding, it is fun, it is long and I would do it again. Peeps for my peeps. Peeps and beer, that’s all you will remember about Starnes, and that is all you need to. Let me end by saying, if you don’t agree that the trip was in fact awesome, and worth your time, than you should stop caving. You can complain and bitch all you want (when you’re out) but at the end of the day you can only say that you had fun.
