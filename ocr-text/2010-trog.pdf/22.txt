met up with us there and we got directions to Resumidiero del Borbollon and Los Lobos. On
the way back to the cars, several of us bought some fireworks (pyrotechnica or "bumbas‚Äù) We
then went to the Mercado Tangamanga and got food for our next two days, beer, and water. We
drove to the Rancho del Borbollon and set up camp there.

After breakfast, the group split up. Travis's truck had some issues, so he drove it to SLP to be
repaired. Some people went to the Valle de los Fantasmos to rappel some short pits. I went
into Borbollon with Deighan, Beth, Aaron, Julie, Brian and Mike. Carrying the rope through
the cave was a huge hassle- like carrying two 50-lb duffel bags through Links for about 40
minutes. We rigged a handline near the top of the pit and rigged the pit and a pigtail. After
Deighan rappelled the pit, I rappelled, then Julie did. The rappel was great- I had my StenLight
on turbo and I could see a lot, but I still couldn't see the bottom of the pit. Julie and I looked
around the bottom of the pit- it was awesome. There were tons and tons of fossils- whole re-
frigerator-sized pieces of breakdown full of cemented fossils in outstanding condition. The
echo in the cave was amazing too- any sound echoed for at least 30 seconds. After Beth and
Aaron rappelled, Julie and I climbed tandem out of the pit, in about an hour and a half. We
waited while Brian rappelled and Mike decided it would be too late by the time he made it back
out of the pit, so Mike and Julie left the cave while I waited for Aaron and Beth to climb out.
Aaron and Beth made it up and I was already wearing a trashbag and cold. Mike made it back
into the cave with a sweatshirt for me (wet from being dropped in a puddle in the cave) and a
