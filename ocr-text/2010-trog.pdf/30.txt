THE EXODUS
PHILLIP FANSLER
It was pretty much a normal Saturday morning. Eight hours of general debauchery, in-
cluding, but not limited to, cross-dressing, wanton destruction, and pissing off neighbors, fol-
lowed by four hours of sleep the night before preceded the usual cave trip. Miller's Cove was
the name of the game today, forty-five minutes driving and another forty-five minutes hiking to
a hole in the ground on US Forest Service property. I had been looking forward to this trip for
weeks and the haze of a four-hour sleep deficit didn't bother me. I wasn't even troubled about
the disturbing images of the night before, somehow the thought of college-age males running
through an apartment complex wearing my roommate's Disney princess dresses didn't affect

There were nine people on the trip, including two people I didn't know. The leader of
the trip was grizzled veter-
an of the cave club, Joe
Zokaites. He graduated
from Tech sometime be-

and never left. He was a
decorated caver, had sur-

had ever been in, and was
also a sort of fatherly fig-
ure if you got to know
him. He'd been through
the worst trips, the best
ones, and was prepared for
either scenario at all times.
Some other cavers that
were on the trip included
the current vice president
(John Bowling), the future
secretary (David Bour-
don), the future vice presi-
dent (John Mulheren), and
the previous president of
As a result of this experience, Phillip Fansler was awarded
the Cave Club (Brian
that prestigious Brain Bucket Award. He also was awarded
Wolford). Two that I did-

n't know were a grad stu-
dent and his fianc√©e. They
were a bit prissy, like most grad students are. They were also rock climbers.
Our caravan of three cars pulled onto the side of the road next to a cow field. The winter
wind stung my face as I stepped out of the car and changed into my caving gear. Mud stained
blue jeans, a ripped t-shirt, a belt that surely could be used as some form of macabre torture
