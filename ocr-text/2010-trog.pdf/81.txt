Easter Beer
*
Lauren's beer challenge went well again this year with people climbing trees and diving in-
to the creek for beer, yelling something akin to “Fuck, it's cold!”.
*
No mini-kegs were pulled out of trees (and then the river they were dropped in). Instead a
couple kool-aids were found. These however, could be traded to the kids for beer.
*
People love the hot tub; is there water in there or just bodies?
Work Weekend
Work weekend has had a good
showing over the last two years.
The one before those two had
only one undergrad go. In fact,
the showing is so good that, as
was determined last year by ob-
serving the working habits of
cavers, just watching someone
work counts as work.
Vertical Sessions
Cave Club members are al-
ways helpful, willing to start
vertical sessions for those
that need them.
To make this experience all
the more enjoyable they may
even get up in a tree and play
the guitar. John Mulheren
followed this by putting John
Bowling's actions to song.
This was not always appreci-
ated, particularly by John
Bowling.
