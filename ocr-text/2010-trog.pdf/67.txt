Mike (while wearing a pink leopard print bra):
Who wants to dance with the transvestite?
Travis: I was taking a piss! When you put beer in, you gotta let beer out. I'm
magical- I can turn any beer into corona.
Beth:
What's the weirdest thing you've seen someone try to smuggle
across?
Border Guard 1: Well we've had people trying to smuggle meat across in the
engine compartment...
Border Guard 2: Midgets in speaker boxes...
Aaron:
Really officer, I ran over a cow... and that speaker was sounding
kinda funny- I guess it was the Mexican comedian in there.
Ray: Lauren is out of the vehicle
Travis: Lauren should never be out of the vehicle!
Radio conversation before rope gets pulled out of Golondrinas, leaving Aaron and
Beth in the pit during the bird flight
Paige: How much will you bribe us to put the rope back down after the birds fly?
Beth: I'll pay you back in tacos.
Paige: No meat?
Beth: Veggie and refried bean tacos
Paige: You've got yourself a deal
Aaron: Ask her how much she is willing to bribe us not to put rocks on the rope
Paige: Touch√©
Alex: You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him f@&% the donkey
