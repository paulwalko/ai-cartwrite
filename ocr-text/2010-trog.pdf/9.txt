JOINING THE VTCC (AGAIN)
LUKE GOLLADAY
Beginning the process of joining the Virginia Tech Cave Club has been both a fun and
rewarding process. Much more fun the second time around no doubt about that. The best part
about caving is that I get to reuse all of my old Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets (VTCC) sweat-
shirts and they all ready have the right acronym. Instead of hollering for a FRESHMAN to
come “learn” how to clean the old 1903 springfield drill rifles or polish brass, it’s TRAINEE,
time for you to learn how to decontaminate gear and coil rope. The training program and it's
similarity to Corps generated training programs got me thinking, I wonder if any of the found-
ing members were cadets? And thus I started my research into the history of the cave club.
There is an excellent article about how the VPI Student grotto was established as a part
of the NSS by Tommy Watts, Ralph Hess and George Crabb and how there was a national
meeting of the NSS at VPI on September 5-6, 1942 however the Cave club was not a student
organization listed in the 1942 or 1943 yearbook known as the Bugle. “Bugles were not pub-
lished during 1944-1946 because of the limited number of students on campus during those
years. World War II called many VPI students away from their studies and into service to their
country.” [1] The bugle was published again in 1947 and in this issue of the Bugle a full page
is given to the Cave Club. In this issue there are 40 reported members and 4 officers. Of these
44 students I wondered how many of them were ever cadets. For this I would have to find a
timeline of the history of VPI [2]
*
1924 – Participation in the Corps of Cadets becomes optional for juniors and seniors
*
1936-40 – The completion of massive new construction (of what would later be named
Burruss Hall, Squires, Eggleston, Owens, Smyth, Hutcheson, Hillcrest, Holden,
and other buildings), financed in large part by New Deal programs, transforms
the VPI campus
*
1942 – Organization of VPI grotto of National Speleological society
*
1947 – Cave club officially in the Bugle
*
1949 – Total degrees granted in one year first top 1,000
*
1964 – Corps of cadets becomes optional for all male freshmen and sophomores.
*
1973 – Corps admits its first female cadets
This means that all of the male members of the VPI cave club would have been mem-
bers of the Corps of Cadets for at least 2 years. This would explain the similarity of the training
program in that the XO Executive Officer (Vice President) is in charge of training and signs off
