DUAL FIXED LOOP KNOTS
JESSIE SAKACH
Fixed loop knots are often used when rigging to multiple anchors. This can be important
if there is no suitable single anchor point available, for optimal rope placement, or as an extra
safety precaution. A major advantage is that if one anchor fails, and the remaining anchor can
withstand the force of the load, the system will still work. An example of this is rigging into
two bolts in a wall, or to two smaller trees near a drop, rather than just one.
Self-equalizing rig allows the load to be distributed evenly between multiple anchors.
Dual fixed loop knots like the bowline on a bight or double figure eight are common choices for
this. A Y-hang is another way of rigging to more than one anchor. It can be helpful if you need
to position the rope away from a wall or other obstacle. In addition to the bowline on a bight
and double figure eight, the double alpine butterfly can also be used in a Y-hang. Although the
first two knots mentioned are admittedly quicker and easier to tie, the double alpine butterfly
has the advantage of being multi-directional. A specific case where a multi-directional knot is
beneficial is if you have a cable ladder rigged into a belay line.

Each of these knots has its own advantages and disadvantages, some of which were cov-
ered in the chart. Other factors may include rope strength and personal preference. You should
pick the knot that best suits your specific needs.
