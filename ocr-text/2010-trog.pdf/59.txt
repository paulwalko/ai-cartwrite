You can turn anything into a song:
from a massive epidemic killing all the bats to goat sex to Lepara sucking. Next: Gay Freebird.
When picking up girls:
Put on your pimp face. This is best when done with a
pimp hat, preferably something resembling a lepre-
chaun hat. There is a reason Lucky the leprechaun is
called “Lucky” (and those lucky charms....well..). Al-
so, keep in mind to remember their names. One time
forgotten, oops, two times, slightly irritated chick, three
times, you might want to go back to the girl you were
previously making out with (though she's not as hot).
And if that doesn't work, at least you made someone's
night. But hey, at least it wasn't Phyllis (or maybe too
bad- those legs were smooth). For any more advice be
sure to ask Lucky the Leprechaun.
Being drunk is great, being drunk on crutches...
well at least try not to pee and, especially, pee down a hill when you're in this state. You may
find yourself rolling down it later.
Be wary of Phil.
If you see him swimming towards you in a tub on Dave C.'s lake, he's not coming by to say hi.
No, he's going to sink your ass into a swamp almost as dirty as the duck pond. And he doesn't
care if he goes down in the process. Advice for the future, Phil: never be a commander in the
navy. Kamikaze is
a Japanese thing
(of course, if you
move to Japan....)
Of course this
doesn't always ap-
ply to the sea.
Even in friendly
situations, beware
of elbows, hugs,
and general flail-
ing. But, most im-
portantly, be wary
of Phil.
