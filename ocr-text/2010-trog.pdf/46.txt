One thing we can say for Mexico
though, was though the forces were
against us, the Mexicans were not.
Even at Golondrias they offered us
copious amounts of coffee. Very use-
ful. We used it to fuel our Mike so
that he could continue driving the en-
tire time at optimum capacity. Ask-
ing directions got us invited into a
house for coffee. You knew they
were amazing people for many rea-
sons: for giving us directions, giving
us coffee, making us food, having an
adorable kitty named Tigre (Tiger in
Spanish!), and being cool with a ran-
dom American man taking pictures
with their kids with a machete in this
hands. (Of course, for all we know Mike could be an alien). Then again, their kids were a little
more dubious. Follow us to a cave. Okay, sweet. Wow this is a really long hike... well the
view of the mountains is great... wait, we're in a valley now?.... hey, kid, where is the cave?
Back there? Shit. Julie wasn't even there and her influence
spread to the next generation of Mexicans. Maybe they
recognized Alex as her brother? I nearly throttled Beth in
frustration.
Last year when we
were lost we could
get assistance from
Mexicans. They'd
see you lost on the
campground and
approach. You'd
yelp, but realizing
that you were
fucking smashed, they would still put a hand on your
shoulder and guide you to the bathroom which they
tried to point out to you a few moments before. They
wouldn't be the ones to throw you in the river and play
posable drunk. They would, when you, brave soul,
went foraging for firewood, give it to you instead of
bourbon (although the bourbon was good, in fact, too
good). And for the record, you were wearing pants
then. You put them back on after crossing back over
the river. If I was going for falsehood here I would say
I took out John Bowling by body-slam instead of
bouncing back and falling on my ass ten times. But at
High ho, high ho, it's off to a
cave we ... don't go.
