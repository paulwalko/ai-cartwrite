talking about it a lot.
On the expedition's last big trip, using the new upper entrance, around 4 am we found to our
great dismay a rather large amount of water crashing down what a few hours before had been
children's wading pools. After bobbing for boulders neck deep in brown water, and finding new
ways to climb new waterfalls, we came to the sluiceways. Our sensuous channels and tiny
stream were now an amusement park's water flume on steroids.
A bold jump ensued after which a rope got everyone to a shelf on the wall. A narrow bulge in
the face was the path down to..... to see if there were any more obstacles. No handholds. The
ginger traverse wasn't too unlike the 'practice' one down near the lower entrance. Remember
that part of the water flume where it goes through a saw mill? Well, that could be imagined
about ten meters below.
We continued up past the in-feeder passage pumping out the water. Climbing up into Cloud
Ladder Hall we were reasonably confident dry ground was ahead. During a pause, taking in the
vast nothingness of the room, someone said, “Ok, maybe that was practice for the real thing”.
WTF?! Since
when do Bears have
wings!
