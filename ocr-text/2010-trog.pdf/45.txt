I am sad to say that the horse wasn't the only victim.
We lost John Bowling early in the trip. He was forced
to be Julie's spreadsheet slave and do spreadsheets for
her at 6 in the morning. (No joke). And as much as he
loved death metal, apparently he wasn't hard core
enough to enjoy her whip. Yes, she had an actual whip.
Slavemaster Julie kept it on her at all times until Phil
triumphantly stole it away. Unfortuanetly, John M. sold
him out for 20 pesos which is roughly worth less than
two dollars. Oh, John, you know you were an Uncle
Tom. But at least you participated in outing her at the
hot springs at Hotel Tanuil. And she thought she could
disguise herself as one of us with mud all over her face.
Ha. Many were the tricks
of Kim Jong Julie, but we
were on to her.
As if she was that
Look at poor John Bowling,
generous...
trapped by the wiles of Julie.
Oh yes, we had copious
amounts or beer. We had
campgrounds. But where were the times of good bondage? I mean
the not-getting-whipped-by Julie but tying-drunk-since-3-in-the-
afternoon-Mike-to-a-chair at Golondrias? What other fun than run-
ning away from a liberated Mike that thought chasing a be-lighted
Alice was like chasing a firefly? The only one asleep there was Da-
vid atop the cooler, who, god knows how he slept with Phil and
Mike singing “The KKK Toke My Baby Away” so many times and
at the top of their lungs until the next morning when you're climb-
ing up Golondrias it's the
only thing you can think.
Damn, those were the
days, when you actually
went caving and made it
up Golondrias in an hour.
Those parties would
spring up and you'd come
back from Cepillo with
Beth putting a beer in your
mouth until Mike nearly
toppled on top of her gui-
tar sending her into the
tent for the night. But did
we party at Golondrias in
the Reign of Kim Jon Ju-
lie? No. We got rained
on.
This is the happiest picture of John I've ever seen
and yes that's a fridge full of beer.
