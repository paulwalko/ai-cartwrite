SURVIVING THE REIGN/RAIN OF
KIM JON JULIE
LAUREN WADDELL
Pelted by rain, packing up the
cars once again by Golondrias,
one couldn't help but wonder
what had happened to Mexico.
This year Mexico was unprece-
dentedly cold. A problem if you
thought “I won't need a winter
coat” and decided shorts and t-
shirt were the way to go. Fortu-
nately, I packed enough layers
to survive the cold and, with
John's hobo jacket on top of
them all, was just trashy looking
enough to insure against any
robberies. I also discovered that
having a boyfriend your size
gave new meaning to getting
into someone's pants (if only it
was that hot).
But looking back on it, trying to
determine the source of Mexi-
co's wrath, I came to one con-
clusion; all the forces of nature
were rebelling against the ascen-
sion of Kim Jong Julie.
Even the Mexicans were laughing at our pain
We should have expected this
earlier. While in the Golden Era of the Reign of Deighan we could just be like “Hell ya I want
to go to Mexico!”, this reaction was now met by “Requirements, bitch!” (loose translation). We
actually had to do WORK to meet them. And this was around finals too. Of course, there were
those that didn't even try to meet them. Take Phil, for example, who would go on to become
one of the shinning leaders of the resistance.
Surprisingly, this resistance even found support in the non-living elements of this world.
Travis's truck, the Karstmobile, aware of the impending doom, tried playing dead before we
even left off. It was a brave attempt but later he would found himself dying on the campground
