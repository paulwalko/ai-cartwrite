HOW TO TIE A ONE
HANDED BOWLINE
PHILIP SCHUCHARDT
Step 1: Put the tail-end of a piece of rope
behind your back.
Step 2: Place the tail over the standing line.
The tail should be over top of the standing
line.
Step 3: This is the hardest step! Twist your
hand underneath the standing line. This
should create a small loop in the standing line
(the rope that isn't in your hand), NOT the tail
(the rope in your hand).
