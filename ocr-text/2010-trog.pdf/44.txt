tried to waylay the doubts of the public. Yes, it was
a beautiful cave, but it also was a cave of signs. Oh,
lights were draped on a formation labeled Christmas
tree with light shinning down from a hole from
above, but this was a ruse. We saw the “mano de
muerte” and fortunately we knew enough Spanish to
realize this meant “the hand of death”. Only what
was labeled “the face of god”, which we recognized
as the face of the beardless Mike, gave us hope. We
came out alive but nearly lost Brian, dangerously
close to the inferno”.
This type of near-death encounter was common on
this trip. Besides the sketchy road system where
passing cars involved going into a two way lane (yes,
I mean cars going both directions in the same lane)
there was the evil demon that is a GPS system. We
found ourselves, by following this masochist demon,
going right next to some railroad tracks. This doesn't
look like a road... No shit, Sherlock. It probably was
the GPS's goal to be on the tracks, but, well, this was
pretty close. And we did get to experience the loveli-
ness of Mexico that is, probably, it's ghetto.
"Mano de Muerte”
And yet, somehow we still managed to get where we were going. But even then we found our-
selves limited. Rather than make a V for victory with our arms atop abandoned mining villages
which we were free to do last year, we found ourselves only hearing about possible ways to en-
tertain ourselves. For instance:
the existence of mescal a few
hours away. Key word here
though: only. Despite Mike's
desperation for drugs, we came
back empty-handed. Mike
would have to wait until a Mex-
ican, recognizing in Mike's
eye's a similar need to his own,
would hand over some drugs
free of charge. On the plus
side, we had our first instance
of rebellion. John M.'s horse
on the way back down the
mountain to Real De Catorce
tried his best to poop on Julie. I
can only say, poor Julie's horse.
Freedom!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It was an innocent victim.
