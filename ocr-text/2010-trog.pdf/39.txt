REFLECTIONS ON
WHITE NOSE SYNDROME
WIL ORNDORFE, VPI CAVE CLUB OLD FART
The editor asked me to write this since I am very involved in the "official” response to
the horrible scourge that is decimating our cave bat populations. I'll not comment on the bat to
bat versus caver transmission debate except to say that anyone who thinks that the transmission
vector must be one or the other has an agenda other than the truth.
There are volumes of information available on the web regarding WNS that cover the
history of its spread and the theories of the disease itself. So instead of doing a poor job rehash-
ing that information, I'd just like to share some of my thoughts on the subject.
The spread of and dev-
astation wreaked by WNS leave
those trying to respond to it
with a profound sense of help-
lessness, which in turn breeds
frustration. So far, WNS has
always been at least one step
ahead and one step harsher than
predicted. In Newberry-Bane
Cave last week, where there
should have been thousands of
bats there were but dozens, and
carcasses littered the floors of
some rooms filling them with
the smell of death. We had
hoped that perhaps the shorter,
milder winters in the central
Appalachians would afford bats
a better chance. If so, it doesn't
appear to be significantly better.
Another Caver Response to White Nose:
One of the things we did at
It makes a great costume
Newberry-Bane was to band a
couple of hundred bats in 2009
in the hopes of tracking the progress of WNS and finding resistant individuals, and to track
movements of bats from WNS positive caves. On our trip last week, we found but a single Lit-
tle brown bat alive with one of our bands – BCI 0925.
For the banding study, Stonley's Cave in Tazewell was to be a control since WNS wasn't
there yet. But when we stopped there in February, dozens of bats staged in twilight showed it
was just another infected site.
