packed. Travis had hurt his back in the meantime and Aaron was helping him stretch to see
what was wrong. We got a late start from the hotel and went to go see some old Huastecan ru-
ins. We had lunch at a pizzeria near Valles where the front door was broken and only held on
by a pair of pliers and the waitstaff told us they only had pizza and burgers and they had no
pepperoni, so we ordered salchichas, which turned out to be a pizza with hot dog slices on it.
They had finished cooking the pizza before they brought out our drinks. We stopped at the su-
permercado Soriana in Valles where we all bought the liquor we planned to take back to the
US. We started off for Victoria and finally got there around 11 pm. We checked into the Hotel
Sierra Gorda downtown and finished drinking the beers while playing a game Ray had brought.
We got to bed late, around 2 am.

Woke up late, around 10 am Julie and I had breakfast with Travis in the hotel restaurant and
then she and I went shopping for some stuff to bring back. Julie bought some mortars and pes-
tles and I didn't find any of the woven tunic-type shirts I wanted. We had planned to leave at
noon but finally left just after 2 pm. We crossed the border around 8 or 9 pm and we all three
got pulled aside to run some of our bags through the portable x-ray machine. Customs also
found a bag of oranges and some leftover fresh-squeezed orange juice from Mexico and told the
CR-V that they would owe a $300 fine but that they would waive it. Then we had to dig
through the truck again to get out all of the liquor bottles. Apparently we also would have owed
duty on the bottles but Customs never told us, so we just paid the Texas ABC fees. After that
ordeal, we went to Whataburger for dinner and drove through the night.

We drove across the US, finding weird stuff in the gas stations of Louisiana and Mississippi. I
bought Julie some Drank: Extreme Relaxation Beverage (like an anti-energy drink) in hopes
that she would sleep
in the car on the way
home. We stopped
for dinner at Cracker
Barrel outside Chat-
tanooga. We drove
on through the night.
