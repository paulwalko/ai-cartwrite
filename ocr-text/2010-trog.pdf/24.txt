We woke up before 7 to make
breakfast since we heard from
Sr. Alvarez (the ranch owner)
that he would send someone
to lead us to the Pit of the
Bull at 8. We packed up al-
most everything at the ranch
and finally someone came
between 11 and noon. The
man told us that the pit,
which Mike described as sim-
ilar to Neversink, was about
35 minutes away and that
there was no path- we should
take machetes and be ready to
use them. We decided that it
was too late and too far and
just went to the Valle de los
Fantasmos- a huge park off of
the side of the highway with
karst pillars. The valley was
filled with pits from a few
feet to over 200 feet deep and
several tall limestone spires.
We looked around first and
found a pit near the truck and
much further back found a pit
we dropped rocks into and
estimated to be around 400
feet deep. We came back
with a 450(?)-foot rope and spent an hour and a half debating the rig. I wanted to rappel from
the higher side of the pit rigged to a rock and redirected off a nearly foot-diameter tree hanging
over the pit. Aaron didn't want to rig in over the pit, so insisted on rigging off of a rock further
away on the low side, in which the rope went down a gentle slope to a lip and laid against the
wall for the first 30-40 feet. We finally rigged it and padded it extensively the way Aaron want-
ed. When Aaron let down the rope he swore the whole rope was at the bottom, though the oth-
ers thought it was only about 200 feet at most. Aaron dropped into the pit, followed by Beth,
Sandy and Mike. It was starting to rain and I had loaned out two lights, my rack and gloves, so
I went back to the truck with Julie to start repacking while Travis stayed at the top of the pit.
Mike, Travis, and Julie all said they would've rigged it the way I suggested, which would've
been easier on a ropewalker and probably not required padding at all. Once everyone was back,
we went back to the Rancho Borbollon and found the group there with Travis's 4Runner fixed.
The CRV and Pathfinder were packed and we finished packing the 4Runners in the rain in the
dark and left for Xilitla. We made it to Ciudad Valles by 1 am, so we stayed in the Hotel Pi√±a
near the city's Centro.
