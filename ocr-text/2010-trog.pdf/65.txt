White Nose Bat Apocalypse
we fairies live in grottos,
you'll find us in the mud.
And with it the smell
With noses “pure as snow”
we lie within these living
coffins, twitching at near-
sneezing holes, shaking
out a last confession to..
god knows? “Here lie we,
(an epitaph), the angels
(we smell of demons)
Of __ certain death”
(we look of demons).
And watch (Narcissus,
Narcissus! Do, you hear?)
as demons die by angel
swoop, sword swinging
with fire in the eye?, yet
(And have you come, come-)
How can this be when
(at last?) the angels are
a-dying? When the angels
are a-crying? What tears
devils weep all aflame;
you see, we're (who?)
“the ones to blame”
We,
who ravish flies, sung
tempos dulled upon
your pouted lobes (vi-
brations!) eyes blinded
by (turn off the light!)
what you carry on your
head, sunlight shot deep
as lead and caverns stand
in revelation! And this is?
What? Here and here
and here a bat, dead? Oh,
prince, come with kiss
of turpentine (Echo,
Echo), come a-lifting
this too transparent lid
(is who?)
Lauren Waddell
but no, it is all white.
Like rims around the
pupil, all white. Wide
eyed future dic-
tator, perplexed upon
the steed, stand back to
see the subject fungal,
festering you peace
lilies, poppies (what
a lady!),
