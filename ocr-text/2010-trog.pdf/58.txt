Fireworks!
And if you should burn yourself, put your finger in
water. Wait awhile. Time for fireworks again.
Careful to throw the fireworks far away so they
don't explode by your ear and give everyone hear-
ing damage. Also be wary of location. Fireworks
are loud. If you set them off at picnic when every-
one's asleep you may hear the sound of a motor
driving away. That's Kirk leaving at three in the
morning. If you are lighting them off the roof of a
fancy hotel in Mexico you may be waking some
people up. You also may have a hard time coming
back next year. And if you launch them slightly
farther away from a fancy hotel/spа in Mexico and
they're the big ones.... Well, no one really cares
but the friend that came looking for you and, P.S.,
they're not the cops.
You can make new friends
if your loud partying wakes the neighbor who

should happen to come over in his boxers. You
may find yourself wondering where your friend
went. Don't worry, you'll find him returned just before
he starts being obnoxious and hating life.
Creek run!
Hot tub- sauna – creek-sauna- creek- hot tub – creek-
and it goes on and on and on. Loud cursing is expected.
Make sure to keep track of your alcohol (unless it's East-
er beer, in which case, there's beer in the river). It's
good for drunk singing in the sauna. Not so helpful if
you're passed out in the sauna.

Have a Chalice.
The Chalice is composed of a cooler full of alcohol. The
Chalice is the gift of Francois (see the French aren't so
bad, or maybe the French Canadians, or maybe just the
people who like French names). The Chalice has disci-
ples such as Mini-“sois, also christened M-sois and M-
sois dog. The Chalice could always use more disciples.
The rule of the Chalice is that it is always filled and al-
ways passed around
