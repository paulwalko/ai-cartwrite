WHEN VPI HAUNTS DIXIE CAVERNS
JOHN MULHEREN
Every year our beloved club takes part in the Dixie Caverns Haunted Cave. Not only
does this event make money for the club, it allows timid cavers the opportunity to scare to poop
out of terrified tourists. Cavers from other grottos in the area also participated. The cavers are
usually given smaller roles like “vampire 3”,
“deceased”, or my personal favorite, “flesh
meat”. Our instructions were pretty simple: 1.
Hide 2. Scare people. Even though these roles
are pretty minor, they put a lot of detail into
the make up. Everyone had fake cuts and
blood oozing all over their faces. Real actors
were given more important parts. Like every
Halloween scary thing, this one had the oblig-
atory giant chainsaw guy. This guy was a total
pro at terrifying people. In fact, he was scary
before he got into his costume. Most of the
other actors were placed around the cavern to
distract the guests so that they would be easier
for us to scare.
The most satisfying part of being a
haunter was the reactions. There is definitely
something strangely satisfying about making a
little girl scream, or making some fat kid cry
for his mommy. But these were the easiest
scares, in fact, too easy. After a while making
a little girl scream wasn't enough; you had to
make her mother scream too. Everyone devel-
oped their own scare tactics throughout the
night. Some grabbed a passing shoulder or arm, others touched tourists with fake severed
limbs. Others stuck to the more traditional, yet still effective, method of popping out and
screaming.
Mary Sue Socky of the Blue Ridge Grotto organized much of this event. She really
made sure that the atmosphere was perfect for scaring. In place of the usual bright lights that
light up Dixie Caverns, red tinted lights gave the cave a much darker mood. Fog machines
were sprinkled throughout the cave, ensuring that the guests couldn't see the hidden caver who
was waiting right around the corner. Not everyone enjoyed the spooky atmosphere. Some
young kids and their parents acted like they were in total agony throughout the whole cave. But
we were reminded that all the guests had paid to be scared.
Overall, the Haunted Cave was a pretty awesome time. We had lots of people come out
on several different nights to make some money for the club. So if you want to support the club
and have a great time, come out next Halloween and be a haunter at the Dixie Caverns Haunted
Cave.
