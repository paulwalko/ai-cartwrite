will use the heaters.
These heaters may make it easier for the bats to
sleep and save them from losing energy searching for
a warmer spot to sleep. The energy they use looking
for one burns much needed fat storage which results in
the emaciated bats.
Willis does bring up the concern over whether
white nose is spread in the summer and how the heat-
ers would affect the outcome in such a case. He be-
lieves that the heaters could potentially prolong the
lives of infected bats and allow them to pass it on in
the summer. However, the fungus has been found to
be a cold loving fungus so this worry is not a concern.
What does concern people is the impact White
Nose Syndrome could have on the ecosystem. Natu-
rally, many worry about the fate of the bats, particular-
ly already endangered bats like the Indiana and Virginia
and Ozark big-eared and gray bats. However, the fate
of bats affects the food chain they are in and people
worry about how the death of so many bats will affect
the insect population. Without the bats to eat certain
insects, these insects can proliferate, some of which will
destroy dozens of crops like apples and wheat. So not
only does White Nose Syndrome concern biologists and
cavers, but also farmers whose living depends on the
conditions of the crops they grow that are threatened by
batsâ€™ absence.
Because of these concerns cavers and any others
concerned have been focusing on what the can do to
stop and prevent WNS. Cavers as a result have been
cautious about where they cave, believing that they
may have something to do with the spread of the syn-
drome.
The fact that the outbreak jumped from New
York all the way down to Virginia supports this view.
This happened suddenly and surpassed many miles
from one outbreak to the next. That distance covers
hundreds of miles which makes it hard to believe that
bats could have spread it flying that far. Breathing
Cave and Clover Hollow in Giles County are two such
caves that Virginia Department of Conservation and
Recreation biologists Chris Hobson and Wil Orndorf
on Wednesday, February 25, 2009 discovered to be
infected. Also, the fact that White Nose appears first
in caves that cavers most often visit further supports
the inference that cavers may be spreading it.
