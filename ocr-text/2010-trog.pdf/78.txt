Float Trip/Summer 2009
Glasses?
Who needs
them for the
weekend?
* Rope Spring was passed so Deighan and few
others canoed over to it. Wasn't there. Had
to climb tree and toss over a rope for a new
one. Lauren’s glasses were sacrificed to the
river god in the process.
* Random guy hopped on the float with his dog.
He was drunk at ten in the morning and had
left his wife behind asleep in the tent.
* Floated around in innertubes
* Had music and group danced, YWCA!
Had the Chalice, it provided everyone with
alcohol for a fun day and long night of creek
runs between creek, sauna, fire, and hot tub as
well as “frolicking”
*
*
YMCA!

Also that summer:
Mini Float trip and Fourth of July,
Times of fireworks, creek runs, creek floats, and
four-wheeling
The Chalice!
