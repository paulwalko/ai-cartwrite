HOW TO BE A CAVE CLUB GROUPIE
JULIE BOOKER
How To Be a Cave Club Groupie:
* Go to the before Cave Club meeting - stay until you are late for the meeting or just
stay.
* Go to the Cave Club meeting just in time to find out where people are going for din-
ner and where the spelioseminar will be held that night.
* Take a trip down to Mexico without going into Golindrinas; it's way too deep and
you have some shopping to do.
Cave only when family or friends visit.
Attend OTR, Picnic, and TAG, but don't cave - you are there to socialize with cav-
ers.
* Buy gear or get your parents to buy you gear - don't get it too dirty or worn.
* Plan to cave on a Saturday, but cancel because you had too much fun at the speli-
oseminar the night before.
* Date a member of the club, you can cave vicariously though them.
Or you could just get it all over with after six years and become a Cave Club member (you oth-
er groupies know who you are).
