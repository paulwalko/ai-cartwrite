In response to this The Virginia Cave Board and Natural Heritage Karst Program asked
for a moratorium, a voluntary ban, on caving until April 15, 2009, a request also purported by
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service who proposed in March 2009 that cavers should stay out of
caves within 17 states. The U.S. Forest Service also closed caves and mines on the National
Forests Eastern Region ranging over a span of 33 states. This moratorium they set for April
24th 2009 to cover a span of a year, possibly ending in April 24h 2010, and hope that in this
time scientists will be able study white nose to learn more about it and how to deal with it.
It has been found that White Nose Syndrome is genetically similar to a strain of symbi-
otic fungus on bats in alpine caves in Europe. This leads to implications that WNS was intro-
duced to America's ecosystem from Europe. This would help explain how quickly and deadly
it has taken affect since bats in America would not have been able to build up an immunity to
an unfamiliar disease.
Although it is now past the April 15 moratorium and cavers have begun to cave again
they still have been taking precautions. They have been asked to stick to a particular caving
area in order to avoid spreading WNS. Also, they were requested to have a particular set of
caving clothes and equipment for the area that they wash and disinfect after each caving trip,
preferably with a bleach or alcohol solution for the gear, especially if they intend to go out of
the area.
Although the situation has improved for cavers with the resumption of caving, things
look grim for the fate of the bats with the rate they are dying and may not bode well for farmers
with an increase in the insect population. Still, cavers will do their best to take the recommend-
ed precautions when caving so that they can still enjoy caving and be respectful of the bat popu-
lation as well.
I'm so fing tired of all these
