LETTER FROM THE EDITOR
Hi! I want to thank
everyone for the contribu-
tions. This Trog ended up
longer than I thought, but I
consider that a good thing
and hope you'll look
through all the articles be-
cause we really have some
good ones. It's been a long
while since we've had a
Trog so in a way you can
think of this as a culmina-
tion of all those Trog-less
years. And of course, I'd
like to thank everyone for
all the work they've put in.
Props to John Bowling for
the longest article (as well
as getting me Microsoft
Publisher and other soft-
ware) and Beth for the
quickest response.

I hope people will continue to send stuff in. It's
interesting to see old Trogs and I think we have a lot of
interesting stories to tell. I hope for the future more peo-
4ple will send in quotes as well as things for the grapevine.
Try to keep track of those things. Pictures and comics are
always encouraged too. I'd also like to recommend to
older cavers to share their stories since they have a wealth
of experience and I've heard older cavers brag about how
awesome the cave club was when they were young.
So keep up the good work and keep sending articles!
