One of the many puzzling elements of the WNS pandemic (plague, scourge, mess???) is
its fungal nature. Biologists and paleontologists alike are scratching their heads at both WNS
and the Chytrid fungus, which is devastating amphibian populations around the globe. In gen-
eral, animals are attacked by bacterial while plants are attacked by fungal pathogens. In partic-
ular, communicable fungal pathogens capable of rapid transmission are very rare. Because of
this, when they do occur their victims find it difficult to mount an appropriate immune re-
sponse. This rarity of communicable fungal pathogens caused many investigators early on to
suspect that the Geomyces infections were secondary symptoms of disease caused by the spread
of a primary bacterial or viral pathogen. However, no one has been able to identify any patho-
gen associated with WNS other than Geomyces, suggesting that it is the primary causal agent of
WNS.
Hope refuses to die, though, and silver may line parts of even this darkest of clouds. I
was at a meeting of mammalogists recently, and a speaker reviewing the ecology of Little
brown bats in the northeast made an intriguing point: prior to human population growth and de-
forestation, bat diversity in the northeast had been much higher compared to the present day
with tree bats comprising a much larger portion of the total bat population. Before the arrival of
WNS, Little brown bats with their tolerance for disturbance and fondness for roosting in human
structures had come in the northeast to vastly outnumber nearly all other bat species combined.
Perhaps WNS will help to restore greater balance between cave and tree bat species. And some
cave bat species appear to be less affected by WNS than others. Virginia big-eared bats have
shown no sign of WNS infections, even in Hellhole this winter where tens of thousands of pipi-
strelles and Little browns lay dead or dying all around them. And in Newberry-Bane Cave on
April 9, there were still some survivors: a few dozen pips and a handful of Little browns ap-
pears to be healthy. Maybe they'll make it and over time their descendants will replenish bat
stocks so that VPI cavers in the 22nd century can see things the way they were back in the 20th. I
sure will feel better about this if BCI-0925 turns up alive and well in the North Subway a year
from now.
