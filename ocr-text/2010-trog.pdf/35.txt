new leg strap harness.
I had thought be-
cause I had gotten it
from Deborah and gotten
the chance to try in on
and use it on a rope set
up in Mike’s garage that
I was good. Obviously,
not. I realized that I still
had a ways to go before
being comfortable with
my gear.
Recently, I near-
ly went on a vertical trip
but then it occurred to
me that I had yet to ad-
just my gear. I didn't
want to face another ex-
perience like Fantasmas
so I opted out. Instead, I
went to a vertical ses-
sion. There I was able to
get on rope and try out
my gear and see if I
could make my harness
comfortable.
I learned a lot by
doing this. I learned that
maybe what would be
best for me was to have
rope sown from the leg
loops to the rope around
the waist. I also learned

things I should adjust.
did end up with “On Rope” at banquet
For example, I really
(as well as a compass, but that's another story)
didn't like the unneces-
sary quicklink on my
ascender.
But probably the most important thing is to not rush into things. As impatient as you
may be it may be best to learn about your gear so you don't regret it later. Caving is not as fun
when you're dead or in pain. (Although who knows, maybe zombies get a kick out of caving?)
