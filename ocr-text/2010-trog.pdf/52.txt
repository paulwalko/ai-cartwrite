last survey trip in Beer Can Chasm Cave ended in a wet, 8 foot wide by 2.5 to 3 foot tail pas-
sage. Plastic suits, wet suits, and rubber duckies many be required to continue down the pas-
sage. There's excellent airflow in both caves and suggests a possible connection.

Another interesting but debatable fact is the geology of Blankenship Blowhole and Beer Can
Chasm Cave. They both sit in the footwall of the Narrows Fault. According to the Geologic
Map of Giles County, Virginia, both caves are formed in the Honaker Formation, a predomi-
nantly dolostone with subordinate limestone based Cambrian aged rock. The Honaker For-
mation sits below the Knox group and Middle Ordivi-
ous limestone which most of our caves around Blacks-
burg are formed in. If Blankenship Blowhole and Beer
Can Chasm caves do exist in the Honaker Formation,
it may make them the longest dolomite caves in Vir-
ginia.

This 17.5 foot FRO was unexpectedly surveyed in a
failed attempt to go to Blankenship Blowhole. Blank-
enship Blowhole's entrance was completely sealed off
by solid ice. Sunglasses Caves is located directly
above Blankenship Blowhole's entrance. It was named
after Lepy exploring the whole cave with his sunglass-
es on. The cave was sketched from outside the cave
making the whole experience fairly entertaining. Map

Blankenship Blowhole
- A.I Cartwright and friends
Currently standing at a nice 1.27 miles
and at 138.3 deep, the Blankenship
Blowhole's survey has definitely
slowed down. There are still many mop
up leads and one breakdown pile to
push. Jessie Sakach, Philip Schuchardt,
and John Mulheren made up the last
survey trip. We systematically started
to survey the leads from the entrance
and where able to finish off 3 leads and
got 235 feet in the book. We were
able to name a hidden upper level room
the Straw Pour-ee-um. We only added
