Limestone Air (The Caving Song)
by Beth Mutchler
I'm leavin' this lonesome town (x2)
I'm leavin' this town 'cause I'd rather be underground
I'm leavin' this lonesome town
I'm goin' to the mountainside (x3)
Goin' to where the rock divides
I'm goin' to the mountain side
I'm goin' to smell that limestone air (x3)
'Cause nothin' else can quite compare
I'm goin' to smell that limestone air
I'm goin' deep down in that hole (x3)
I really hope this rope will hold
I'm goin' deep down in that hole
I'm crawlin' around with the bats (x3)
I hope I don't get eaten by a big cave rat
I'm crawlin' around with the bats
I'm headed back to the bat ranch (x2)
I'm headed back to the ranch and if you're lucky I'll lose my pants
I'm headed back to the bat ranch
I'm headed back to lonesome town (x3)
But I left my heart down underground
I'm headed back to lonesome town
