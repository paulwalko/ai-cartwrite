plastic bottle filled
with beer (he and
Julie had broken two
glass bottles trying
to pack them in the
sweatshirt). I caved
out with Mike,
which was tiring
enough before being
very cold. The dis-
tance to the pit is
only about 300 feet,
but it was a fairly
strenuous 300 feet.
We celebrated New
Year's by lighting
off tons of Mexican
fireworks and drink-
ing beer and marga-
ritas (not frozen
since the ice isn't safe) and went to bed late.
1/1/10
I slept in a bit and had breakfast and did dishes. We had breakfast and cleaned up fireworks-
the ground looked like it had snowed. It turned out that Travis's truck had to be left until the
afternoon of the 2nd, so we would have to spend an extra day and a half in the area. Most of the
group decided to go back to San Luis Potosi to stay there and left me, Julie, Mike, Sandy,
Travis, Aaron and Beth to stay at the ranch another night. Julie, Beth and I drove to SLP to buy
more food and beer. When we got back, a few of us decided to look into a cave we heard about
from the ranch's owner. Some cavers had gone to see the cave entrance, a stone well not far off
the road to the ranch. Travis, Sandy, Mike, Aaron, Beth and I went to go check out the cave,
which supposedly had an 800-foot pit inside. We took a rope to self belay on the downclimb to
the cave, which was fairly easy with the footholds inside the well (it was obviously made to be
climbable). I went down first and told the others at the top that it was easily downclimbable
and it opened up at the bottom. Sandy came down next followed by Travis and Aaron. Mike
came down last, barefoot and with no equipment but a headlamp. Beth decided to go back to
camp. We explored maybe another 100 feet before it came to a 15-20-foot well with water at
the bottom. On the way out I spotted two awesomely beautiful blue and white centipedes. We
figured we would come back after dinner with another rope and better equipment- I especially
wanted kneepads and long sleeves, since we had already gone through two rocky belly-crawls.
When we got back to the ranch, Julie had almost finished making chiles rellenos, which we ate
with some guacamole and some cervezas. Most of us didn't feel like going back to the cave that
night to rig, so we went just set up our sleeping stuff inside. We had to spend a while trying to
get the chimney to vent the smoke from the fire. We all went to bed after hanging out and talk-
ing for a while.
