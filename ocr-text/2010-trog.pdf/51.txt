******** Cave,
- A.I Cartwright and friends
Standing at a unimpressive 49.6 feet of survey passage,
it takes an impressive amount of water and has a good
bit of air. This cave's passage is mostly breakdown and
the blowing lead is a 6 inch crack between 2 large
breakdown boulders. There are multiple dig spot lining
the large sinkhole that ******** Cave sits in. It's defi-
nitely an interesting spot.

deep (and going), Beer Can Chasm Cave may be one
of the more decorated caves in Virginia. It features
several clean +6 foot long soda straws, white flow-
stone, crystallized rimstone dams, and an ass-ton
helictite.
Although never dye traced, the cave's water is proba-
bly feeding into Blankenship Blowhole. Beer Can
Chasm Cave is only about 500 feet from known pas-
sage in Blackenship Blowhole. The end of the sur-

and the pride of some (really I make it sound worse
then it really is, divide by 4 for real difficultly). The
