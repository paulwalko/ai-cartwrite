Golondrias

We had breakfast at the hotel's breakfast buffet and then
sat around or did a little shopping or surfed the internet
using the hotel's wi-fi. We drove out of town to Huichi-
huayan to the campground for lunch. We looked at the
local cave for 10 pesos, which was essentially a canyon
into a pit. We walked through the canyon and the guide
told us the pit was about 35 m deep. Aaron asked if we
could rappel it next year and the guide said we could.
We went to Zulema's family's house and had chicken
and tamales and punch and camped in the neighbor's
yard by the road.

We woke up early and set off for Aquismon to get some
breakfast before going to Guaguas. We ate breakfast at
a 24-hour restaurant by the Pemex in Aquismon and
then went up to Guaguas. Travis, Sandy, Ray, Aaron,
Brian, Julie and I went to Guaguas and rappelled the
high side and climbed the low side. Sandy and Aaron
climbed out first, followed by Ray and Brian, then Julie,
Travis and I climbed out trandem. We were actually
well out of the pit by 7 pm, when we told the Mexicans
who carried our rope to come back to carry it back to the
trucks. While packing the ropes, they noticed that
Deighan's rope had become damaged in the center (the
area between the two bags), likely while taking the rope
out of Borbollon. We also intentionally knocked a loose
rock off of the lip of the low side, which damaged the
700' rope about 10 feet from the bottom. After getting
back to the trucks, we drove to Aquismon for dinner and
then drove up to Golondrinas. The road was partially
Mike(2)
paved, only in the top and bottom sections, and we got
lost at one point by following the nicer paved road to the
left when the road to Golondrinas went straight and be-
came dirt. We had to drive to the upper parking lot
since the lower lot is now closed and Deighan met us
there. We had to carry a lot of camping equipment
down the path to the campground, which was very mud-
dy and tiresome at night. We set up camp and slept near
the pit in the thatch cabanas where we have camped in
the past.
