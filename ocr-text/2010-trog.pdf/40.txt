We had hoped to slow the spread and keep WNS out of the range of Gray bats. But this
winter, the rapidly expanding front of WNS overran the northeastern part of the Gray bat range.
A Gray bat infected with White Nose Syndrome has yet to be found, but since they are so close-
ly related to Little browns and Indiana bats, both very susceptible, it would be surprising if
Gray bats aren't vulnerable.
Ecosystem changes resulting from the disappearance of some bats species and vast re-
ductions in the populations of others are difficult to predict. Will insect populations boom?
Will tree bats and birds take up the slack? And how will populations of cave invertebrates in
caves with large numbers of bats fair without the input of guano into the system?
One of the many painful ironies of WNS is that prior to its arrival, bats were actually
fairing quite well. Indiana bats were thriving in New York and New England, and Gray bat
populations were exploding throughout the southeast. Bat counts at most Virginia sites were
either stable or on the rise.
Personally, I feel the WNS tragedy fits nicely in the mold of exotic organisms transport-
ed around the world as a result of globalization. I suspect Geomyces destructans evolved to do
exactly what it is doing, infect the skin of hibernating bats. No one ever paid much attention to
the white fungus on European bats, which seem to tolerate it, until it made the jump across the
pond on a stowaway bat in a shipping container, on a caver or biologists gear, or perhaps some
other way. Geomyces found a home in bats hibernating in the caves near Albany, New York, a
deep water port city, and spread rapidly in all directions leaving few survivors among suscepti-
ble species. Cavers must do all they can to see that its spread is limited by climatic conditions
and bat migration patterns.
Prospects for treatment are encouraging. If only we could only teach bats to take pills,
receive vaccines, apply salves. Or at least to avoid bats already infected. It seems to me the
best hope for treatment lies for highly colonial species such as Gray bats and Indiana bats which
concentrate a very large proportion of their populations in very small areas to hibernate. Should
a safe and effective fungicidal treatment be developed, these hibernacula are prime candidates
to receive it. Many creative and talented scientists are developing a wide variety of treatment
schemes, ranging from “hot spots” in caves where affected bats can congregate to feeding areas
for bats prematurely awakened from hibernation by WNS. As more is understood about how
WNS kills, treatment schemes will be improved and refined. But the clock is ticking and Geo-
myces is always one step ahead, perhaps well before physical or behavioral signs appear in a
newly infected population.
From an evolutionary point of view, extinctions are common. Homo sapiens appears to
have increased extinction rates to be on par with those caused by asteroid impacts and massive
volcanic activity. Globalization, industrialization, deforestation working in step. Hopefully the
mass extinction currently underway, of which several bat species may ultimately be a part, will
not be the only imprint left by the human race in a fossil record examined by sentient cock-
roaches a hundred million years from now. I would vote for a political candidate whose plat-
form was something like “Vote for Lepera and help keep our place in the fossil record secure”.
