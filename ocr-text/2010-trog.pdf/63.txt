The Little Brown White-Nosed Cocaine-Sniffin' Bat Blues
by Beth Mutchler
Inside a little cave where I want to go
There's a colony of bats sayin' no, no, no
Yeah, those little bats don't know where I've been
And they don't want to catch a spreading bat problem
In New York we all know there's a problem with drugs
The bats up there, well they forgot about bugs
They've found something better but it causes them pain
They've all fallen victim to the smell of cocaine
Chorus: I got the little brown white-nosed cocaine-sniffin' bat blues
All I want to do is jump in a cave or two
But for all I know there might be cocaine on my shoes
I got the little brown white-nosed cocaine-sniffin' bat blues
The little brown white-nosed cocaine-sniffin' bat blues
Forget about the border of Mexico
Just below the earth's surface is where it all goes
And in the winter when the bats don't travel up here
They just have to hope that we forget to disinfect our gear
But you and I know it's bad for their health
So reluctantly we put all our gear on the shelf
The cavers don't want all the bats to be dead
So the bats will have to finish hibernatin' to spread
[chorus]
I tried to go to sleep but I wake up and scream
'Cause caving's slowly taking over all of my dreams
The sleep that I'm missin', well you know it's hell
But the cocaine, it surely keeps those bats awake as well
I'm not sure how much longer I can go on like this
Itchin' to be underground like every caver is
Withdrawal from caves is hard to go through
But without their cocaine you know it's hard for bats too
[chorus]
