WHITE NOSE: BEGINNING OF THE END?
LAUREN WADDELL
Spring 2008 Semester:
Recently a deadly disease has exploded amongst the bat population. Known as White
Nose Bat Syndrome, or WNS for short, it has killed hundred of thousands of bats along the east
coast recently and has caused alarm for biologists as well as cavers.
Normally cavers, when in a cave, are careful of
the hibernating bats. Bats are not uncommon cave-life
and often times cavers will run into them when caving.
Brown bats, in particular, they find the most of, some-
times alone, sometimes huddled together, the number
varying across caves. Generally the policy when deal-
ing with bats in caves involves keeping in mind where
they are when maneuvering around in a cave and point-
ing them out to cavers behind to make sure those cavers
don't knock them down. When a bat does get knocked
down, the cavers carefully pick it up and hold it close to
the cave wall and try to get it to hook its claws back in.
So when cavers heard about White Nose Syndrome
they were concerned.
White Nose Syndrome first appeared in Scho-
haire County, New York, in February 2006. In re-
sponse to this the New York Department of Environmental Conservation sent biologists to doc-
ument the outbreak in January 2007. Since then the syndrome has spread, killing hundreds of
thousands of bats. Around a half million bats have died in that time in caves throughout 7
states ranging from New England to West Virginia. The syndrome has affected at least 55
caves and in some of those caves has killed 90 to 100 percent of the bat population.
. Biologists and cavers have been able to identify its outset by the white appearance of a
bat’s nose and other similar white spots on the bats. These markings signify a fungal growth on
them. Another distinguishing feature of the bats appears in their low body weight. Some pos-
tulate that the emaciation of the bats correlates to the fungus, believing that it disturbs the bats’
sleeping patterns. As a result of the fungus the bats awaken more often and when they do they
burn more fat just to stay warm. They therefore go thorough their winter fat storage faster and
run out before their hibernation ends in the spring. This ends up with White Nose bats starving
to death. Also, biologists found that White Nose bats appear more often towards the entrances
of caves, indicating a migration from the deeper depths of the cave they normally rest in.
One response to this was Willis (a biology professor at the University of Winnepeg) and
Boyles' (a graduate student in biology at Indiana State University) proposal to use heaters in
cavers. They state that when bats do wake up they will look for warmer parts of the cave. Wil-
lis and Boris propose having heaters ready for them when they do and plan to test them in a
cave in Mantioba, Canada with the $28,000 funding from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
This experiment, although not used in a white nose infected cave, will see if at least healthy bats
