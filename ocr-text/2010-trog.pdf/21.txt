Woke up in Real de Catorce in
very cold weather. Ate breakfast
at Restaurant Real and then ar-
ranged to ride horses up to the
ghost town at noon. Looked
around in the church full of
creepy zombie Jesuses and then
went shopping while waiting for
the horses. Had to wait on Lau-
ren, Mulheren, and Phil. Rode
the horses up to the ghost town-
was incredibly cold. Mike went
exploring in the tunnel, which the
tour guide didn't appreciate. It
drizzled some on the way back.
We got a snack at the Restaurant el Minero and put our stuff in the room (Julie and I got our
own room- room 10 on the top floor). Mike and I went shopping for rocks at a place uphill
from the main square away from the main shopping venues. Mike bought a huge piece of
quartz (easily 70 lbs) and I bought two pieces of hydrothermal dolomite mixed with other min-
erals. Mike and I talked with Jesus Tabor, who used to work in the mine. We got his phone
number and address so we can arrange for him to take us to the caves or mines where he found
the minerals he was selling. We hope to keep in touch to go on an expedition him with him
next year. We met up and had dinner as a group at our hotel, the Hotel de Abundancia. We had
some beers and Sandy ended up sick after drinking most of a bottle of rum and a beer in our
room.

Deighan had been
corresponding. He
