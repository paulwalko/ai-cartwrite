On the way back to the hotel, we had
breakfast at Deighan's favorite restaurant
about a block off the square. We
checked into the 5-story hotel, the tallest
and probably brightest building in town,
the pink and yellow hotel Puente del Cie-
lo. We reserved the master suite, the
comfort suite, and a king suite, three of
the four nicest rooms on the 5th floor and
put our stuff in the rooms. Mike, Julie
and I went shopping for beer and bought
4 cases and brought them back to the ho-
tel. I then went shopping for blankets in
town and grabbed some tacos before we
met up to go caving. Julie, Sandy, Aa-
ron, Beth and I drove Mike's 4Runner to
the Cueva del Salitre, a huge cave outside
Xilitla. Just down the hill is the cave en-
trance-viewable from the road on the
other side of the valley. The cave en-
trance was probably 200 feet high and
500 feet across, though we spent about
20 minutes looking for it since we took
the wrong path. We looked in the bottom
first, where there was a dark hole, but the
obvious cave was not the entrance. We
found the actual cave entrance after about
15 minutes and climbed into it. We ex-
plored briefly and on our way out we saw
five very large spiders and several large
moths which we didn't see on the way in.
The spiders had about 1.5” bodies and 3-
4” legs- in all they were larger than our
hands and since we also noticed the
ground was littered with small bones, we
decided to leave in a hurry. When we got
back into town, the rest of the group was
grilling on the rooftop with the hotel
owner cooking the meat they bought.
We grilled out and drank on the rooftop
and later that evening started lighting our
leftover fireworks and throwing them
from the balcony and the roof. We
stopped after midnight, after we lost our
tin can we launched off the roof (the pa-
per label was left behind though).
