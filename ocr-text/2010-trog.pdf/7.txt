LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT
Hello VPI Cavers,
This year has been a difficult year for cavers and caving and especially for our bats.
WNS has been the highlight of the year- most of the grotto’s favorite vertical caves have been
closed and decon procedures have slowed down caving or made it too much hassle to go caving
often or at all. Skydusky Hollow and Clover Hollow were WNS-positive going into the aca-
demic year and Tawneys, Pig Hole, Newcastle Murder Hole and many other Virginia caves
were added to that list over the winter. The training program has been going slowly, especially
without being able to take our usual vertical training trips in Clover Hollow. There were few
student members which meant not a
lot of caving opportunity for new
folks, only complicating the WNS
John Bowling,
limitations. Worse of all, things
President 2009-2010
look grim for our fellow part-time
cave-dwellers: the bats are suffering
and we're still confused about how
best to help.
On the positive side, we've
seen a few long-time trainees finish
up their membership and welcomed
into the club as full members since
the last edition of the Trog- bring-
ing us to a current total of 420 VPI
members. We had our usual Mexi-
co trip with 16 participants and we
visited some new caves this year
(see my trip diary, in this edition).
We've been involved in landowner
and conservation projects including
cleaning up Zells Mill Road, clean-
ing out sinkholes on Dr. Wallace's
farm in Pearisburg, repairing the Tawney's gate and helping out the Thompsons at the Picnic
work weekend. The old (and really not so old) folks are giving to the club when they can. This
year Dave Colatosti was recognized with the A.I. Cartwright Honorarium for his years of ser-
vice and friendship to the club. For many the best part of the club- the camaraderie, is prosper-
ing. Banquet was a wonderful event again and the club's usual dinners, Speleoseminars, and
Bat Ranch parties have continued and entertained many cavers and friends. The theme for the
year seems to be “if we can't go caving we might as well still hang out, right?”
Finally I'd like to recognize everyone who has helped the club be the organization we
love. Thanks for helping teach trainees, helping with all the organization, set-up, tear-down,
and cleanup the club needs for its events, leading cave trips, and for your continued dedication
to the success of the club.
Cave softly (only around here and decon your gear afterwards!),
