31 device after what caves it had been through, and a new, dull, leather pair of boots was my outfit for the day. I completed the setup with my 1955 vintage Guy's Dropper carbide lamp, we locked up the cars, and began the long hike to the cave. The two mile hike to the entrance was cold and uneventful. After climbing down the cable ladder into the entrance and navigating the first hour-and-a-half of the cave, we came to the first major obstacle: a thirty foot, extremely exposed, wet, muddy downclimb (or, par for the course when caving). I volunteered to go first, shrugging off offers of a belay. I climbed down, no problems. I took a few minutes at the bottom to inspect my carbide lamp; it was almost out of fuel. No big deal. I shut it off, threw it in my pack, grabbed my spare electric, and attached it to my helmet. Not wanting to waste any more valuable time, I rounded up the next two cavers down and we made our way to lower sections of the cave. I'd been in this cave before, I knew the way. Or did I? Meh. There was really only one way to go anyways, and it's not like we'd get lost. This is a cave, not a Jim Henson movie. After more downclimbing and looking about â€“ There it was! A ledge that played across a canyon wall and eventually petered out about fifty feet away from where I was. No problem. I'd be able to climb down from the end of the ledge. I started to make my way across into the canyon by way of the ledge. I looked over the edge, and saw, to my delight, that another ledge lay underneath the one I was currently on by about seven feet. That would be my next target. Reaching the ex- tent of the ledge, I scouted out my climbing path. The wall below me was okay, it seemed like there were plenty of good holds. Fearlessly, I grabbed an outcrop on the wall and went to pull myself over the edge to feel for footholds when snap! Startled, I pulled my hand off of the wall, with the handhold still in it. Goddamn chert. (For those not in the know, chert is a flint-like rock that is more brittle than the limestone surrounding it, but more resistant to the carbonic acid that eats away the limestone, unfortunately. So what you end up with are outcrops that look like good holds, but break off with little to no warning.) I'd have to be careful here to avoid any bad spills. I grabbed another hold further down, found one foothold and began to search for the next. I was fully vertical at this point, suspended by three points of contact over a thirty foot canyon. I pushed myself off of the wall so I could see the lower ledge I was climbing to, and to scout out my next hold... Snap! Snap! No thoughts had time to enter my mind as I felt my stom- ach jump into my throat when thirty-two point two feet per second squared accelerated my body towards the ground. I blinked, then saw the lower ledge rush past my face. As I crashed into the ground, for a split second, Life became a movie that was put on pause. It was like a cold, windless winter day in the mountains. Like the light snow that falls in a forest of trees without leaves. Like the morning sun that shines over a ridge, casting the folds of the mountain in a cold, pale glow.
