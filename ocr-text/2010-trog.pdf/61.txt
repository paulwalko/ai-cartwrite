SMASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
(Super Smash makes a great drinking game; eventually you'll
be able to win this way.)
When faced with an orgy in the kitchen,
or in other words, the Dante dilemma, you may find yourself
thinking;
Noo!!!!!!! Pikachu!!!!!!!!!!!
1. What the fuck?
2. “I want to”, that chick is hot!
3. “but something feels wrong...”
And find yourself like Dante standing at the edge confused and indecisive. However, there is
one more option you could be thinking;
4. Alright, time for bromance!
When going out to get soda for
mixes and crashing other par-
ties:
if these parties should happen to be a
birthday party, and if they should be a
Harry Potter themed birthday party,
Hasselhoff is an appropriate answer for
what house you are in. Be like Ethan
and not like everyone else and don't
lick the blue Kool-aid off the random
dude's fingers. And if you should get
glow stick gel everywhere in the kitch-
en (what, it's hard to clean up and that
guy realized he doesn't actually know
you?), leave before you're kicked out.
If your friend leaves to go back (was it
for the girl he was talking to?) then
make sure to call him to come back
sometime because you're caving to-
morrow.
But, most importantly,
in the words of Ethan Bramble beneath
the giant fire tower at Tag, you should
“love life”.
And that's the Cave Club way.
Cavers loving life
