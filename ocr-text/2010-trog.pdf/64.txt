POEMS
JESSICA CHESNAKAS
Bats Bats flew around
Bats Bats on the ground
the bats used to be alright
but now they are all covered in white
now the caves are closed
and the cavers are so hosed
with nothing to do
cavers cry boo-hoo
so now all cavers have to do is party
and to others who want to cave, we say sorry.
