MEXICO TRIP 2009 DIARY
JOHN BOWLING
12/26
Left Christiansburg. Drove through the
night.
12/27
Drove through the US. Ate breakfast at
Cafe de Mond in New Orleans. Climbed
on the big star at the Texas welcome cen-
ter.
12/28
Crossed the border around midnight; bor-
der crossing took till about 2 am. Drove to
Sabinas Hidalgo, where we stayed 8 each
in 2 hotels across the road from one anoth-
er. Had breakfast at the Rancho Hotel (the
fancier one). Went to Grutas de Garcia, a
show cave in the mountains above Garcia.
We took the cable car up to the entrance
and took the hour-long tour. The cave was awesome-beats Luray Caverns easily. The view
from the top was awesome too- really cool geology. Headed back to Saltillo to get gas and
beer, then headed toward Real de Catorce following the GPS... We followed the “road” as it got
progressively rougher next to a railroad track until it became impassible and we were forced to
stopped. We cracked beers to combat the frustration and then turned around. We then drove
back to Saltillo and drove through to Real de Catorce. We got there around 2 am and the lights
were off in the first half of the tunnel and no one was up to monitor traffic through the tunnel.
We walked into all of the hotels downtown and luckily found a lady at a hotel on the road with
the Municipal building about a block from the big church.
