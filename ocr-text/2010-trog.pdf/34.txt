KNOW YOU GEAR: OR PERISH
LAUREN WADDELL
WIOIS,
My leg wouldn't stop shaking. It was like Thumper in Bambi, that uncontrollable vi-
brating. What the hell, leg? And then it occurred to me: my body had realized something be-
fore my mind really could. It realized I had nearly died.
At that point, it had been my second year in the cave club. I, being cheap, didn't buy
much gear my first year, instead mooching it off cavers like Deighan who had a ton of stuff and
were always willing to lead trips with new trainees. When I finally did, I was proud to finally
lay claim to my own stuff, ready to mark it in duct tape with my new colors.
In fact, when I did buy things, it was all at once. I was ready to own gear and I wanted
everything. I was also at TAG and what better time for someone too lazy to even order it off
the internet? Since John Bowling and Phil Fansler were with me at the time, I was hoping they
could help me pick things out. Unfortunately, they had wandered off by the time I bought my
harness.
Well, no problem, I thought, then proceeding to buy a harness I found to be comfortable.
Only problem was, comfort wasn't the only thing I should have taken into account as I discov-
ered later when the three of us were caving. Having difficulty frogging up, John explained to
me that I had bought a rock climbing harness which did not work well with a frog, which need-
ed a harness fitted lower and closer towards the crotch. Not only that, my frog needed adjust-
ment and all over it was just a mess.
You think I would have learned from that to be more mindful of gear and how it should
be adjusted and used. Nope.
I found myself atop Guaguas eager to repel the high, 700 foot, side. I had experience
repelling but I had only done roughly 200 feet at most. I wrongly assumed this qualified me for
a 700 foot pit.
As I said, I was wrong. I got myself on rope and I couldn't move. People told me to try
spreading and removing the bars. I tried and was further frustrated at the difficulty I was hav-
ing moving them apart. I removed some bars and then, in this frustration, I took my hand off
the rope to use both hands to spread the bars. I shot down immediately.
Too quickly. I was in shock. I had forgotten to keep a hand on the rope when removing
the bars and not only that, I lost consciousness of anything else I should be doing. I didn't mess
with the bars. I just fell. And screamed and screamed the whole way down.
I repelled those roughly 700 feet in 11 seconds. If it wasn't for John Bowling belaying
me, I would have died.
Of course, as was to be expected, everyone was dubious about me repelling Golondrias.
But I learned my lesson. I practiced for it and learned how to use my rack. I tried to be patient
and careful of how I was spreading the bars, alternating between spreading and clamping them
together. I did Cepillo twice and my successful descents was able to convince the others that I
was ready.
I'm proud to say I've done Golondrias. The descent and ascent were, in my opinion,
pretty well done. I can't say that I am completely free of misunderstanding my gear. I must
admit that this year in Mexico I had had a pretty uncomfortable ascent up Las Fantamas in my
