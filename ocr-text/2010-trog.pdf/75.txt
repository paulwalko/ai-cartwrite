Picnic 2009
* We knew it was going to be good when
they strung up a tyrolean across the site.
Tyrolean
Everyone had their own campsite set up
and some had a a little stove made out of a
heinken can.
Of course, there was an awesome fire and
with that an awesome marshmellow fight:
marshmellows were being pelted all around
the fire.
*
There were also glow sticks including a
glowing sombrero.
* During the day we got to dynamite into
potential caves.
We got to go four-wheeling day and night
(although some got in trouble for a night
expedition)
Fire!
By night we could chase cows to our
heart's content.
* We also got to roll kegs down the hill.
*
And
And of course all this beer was courtesy a
couple huge kegs.
*
Shenanigans abound! And cheese!
Four-wheeling!
