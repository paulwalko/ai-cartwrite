make decisions about who was doing what
pit. Sandy, Travis, and Deighan went off
to do Cepillo and I helped set up Golon-
drinas for Julie, Ray, Mike, Aaron and
Beth to do. My ankles and calves hurt
two much from all the hiking that I decid-
ed not to do Golondrinas, but I carried my
gear down in case I felt better or needed to
perform a rescue on rope. Ray descended
first and then I took pictures of Beth, Ju-
lie, Aaron and Mike as they rappelled. I
then waited while they walked around and
climbed out. The first group made it out
just by 4 pm and the land manager told us
we had to pull up the rope. We pulled up the rope and left Aaron and Beth at the bottom for a
few hours. In the meantime, Mike, Julie and I went up to the cars to repack and Mike and I
fixed Alex's window. We met up with Deighan, Travis, and Sandy on their way back from
Tamapatz and packed some more until it started pouring down rain. Mike, Julie and I drove to
Tamapatz and had dinner in the Restaurant de las Golondrinas, right on the square, where we
had eaten before. We drove back and climbed down the treacherous stairs on the path back to
the pit, which now were muddier than before and had water running down them. When we
reached the pit, the group was still hauling up rope. I helped by de-rigging the rope and then we
went to bed.

After waking up several times due to the cold, we finally got up around 8 am. We didn't hear
the big bird flight- it may have been too cold and rainy for the birds to come out early or tour-
ists to gather. We packed up and climbed out the path, which in the rain had become even mud-
dier and had so much water running down it that it was practically a streambed. We spent a
while repacking the cars in the rain and decided that we'd get breakfast where the Guaguas
group had eaten two nights before while Deighan went to Huichihuayan to see if Zulema was
going to come back with them to the US. After driving down the crappy wet road listening to
death metal, we pulled into the restaurant and had breakfast. Deighan showed up shortly there-
after and told us that Zulema wasn't going back to the US. We parted ways and set off for Tani-
nul while Deighan, Sandy, and Paige left for the US via Victoria. When we got to Taninul we
checked in and started drinking cane liquor and beer. The power went out, so we grabbed head-
lamps and changed into swimsuits and went down to the hot spring, where we hung out until it
was dark. We watched some of the bats fly out of the cave around dusk. We came back up to
the rooms in the dark and eventually had dinner as a group by candlelight. When we came back
up to the rooms and I was tired and passed out but others continued having fun, including using
some of the 4-foot bottle rockets before we crossed the border.

Got out of bed around 9 and had breakfast with the early risers: Ray, Travis, and Alex. Julie
and I looked around the grounds for a while and went into the cave, saw the zipline, and looked
through the small zoo with iguanas, geese and an ocelot. We went back inside, showered and
