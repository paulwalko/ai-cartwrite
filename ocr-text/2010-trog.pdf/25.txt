We got up at 8 and had breakfast in the hotel
restaurant, then set off to drive to Huichihuayan
on the way to Xilitla. We stopped at Zulema's
family's home after driving up and down the
road because Aaron “knew exactly where we
were going”. We stopped to drop off the load
of stuff Aaron's mom gave us to bring to Zule-
ma and we moved Travis's roof rack to the for-
ward two of the three roof rack mounts since
the load bouncing had dented the roof and bro-
ken the rear roof rack mounts. We took off
again just after that to head towards Xilitla and
Las Pozas. We got into Las Pozas and had
lunch at the restaurant across from the entrance
and then we looked around in Las Pozas until it
closed. We drove to Xilitla and had a difficult
time parking since it was market day. We
checked into Hotel Ziyaquetzas on the square
and Deighan, Julie and I talked about what to do
over the next two days. Deighan had earlier
planned for a man to meet us to talk about
showing us the top and bottom entrances to a
wet, vertical cave in which we could do a
through trip. We met another man down-
stairs, Jose, who was the hotel owner's ex-
husband. Jose told us that he could take us
through the caves or he could arrange for
someone to show us them or take us through
them. He said he would check tonight with
his coworkers from the tourism office and
leave us a message at the hotel in the morn-
ing. We went to get dinner at a restaurant
across the square from our hotel and tried a
lot of their mixed drinks, including Sangria
(not like ours), Vampiro (not good) and Cu-
caracha (coffee liquor and 151 served flam-
ing). Several people stayed up late but I
went to bed earlier, planning to go caving the
next day.

We woke up to the sound of the birds on the
square before 7 and when we finally got up
we brought our laundry to the lavanderia.
