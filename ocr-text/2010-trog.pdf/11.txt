Trainee Trying to Escape Double Punishment Matt Switick
There aren’t many times when you can act like an idiot and feel fulfilled for it. I was afforded one of those chances one quiet weekend when I had nothing to do but be stupid. I went to Starnes. We all know Starnes horizontal, the boring, almost forgotten, thirty minute through trip that is frequented by the weak, the enfeebled and the boy scouts. However little do those travelers know that next to the quiet and short horizontal passage is the wet, long, and nuisance pit ridden, vertical Starnes. It has therefore become my duty to make ready those who would seek the treasure of hypothermia that is Starnes. The tip will begin one night at a meeting. A short man wearing a baseball cap will come up to you. Being the trainee you are, you will approach; beware, for this man is the harbinger of misery. The conversation will soon turn to “You going caving this weekend”? “Well, maybe if anyone is interested-I’ll go-where would you think?” you’ll say. This is where it comes: “How about vertical Starnes”? “Sure,” you’ll say. That is until the VP says “oh I went to Starnes and once was enough for me”. He is right! Keep in mind that as you hear this your ego is likely to kick in and dispel his comment for a bout of pussy-ism, after all this man in the cap (who will remain nameless; I’ll just give him the initials D.A.V.E C. for short) has done the trip before. Therefore you set the time and drink the night away. Pointers for setting this trip: Because it is inevitable that you will lose your senses and go to Starnes there are some key things to remember and follow when planning: 1..Don’t go 2.Make the group as small as possible, in fact if you can do it by yourself, by dreaming about it during the night, you would be better off 3.Ensure warm weather and no wind for when you come out. Consider what you are wear- ing at the time of the meeting; if a sweater and hat is included in the ensemble, best to wait for warmer days 4. Use carbide, you won’t, but I feel better saying it 5. Have a spare shirt/pants to change into (while in the Cave) 6. Don’t use knots (yes, people will say they have done it on knots, remember, these people are Deighan), have a frog 7. Have food and water and bring your trash bag and heat; you will likely need them all as you never have before. The day of the trip is upon you and you have your stuff: thrift store shirts, Wal-Mart boots, maybe you even own your own pack, and as you walk to the cave you feel competent, like a caver (despite the actual lack of experience). Once in the cave and having let your eyes adjust you notice that D.A.V.E C. is wearing no shoes, you suddenly realize that this man is much more of a hard ass than yourself and you wonder what you’ve just done to yourself. This is a good time to point out that the trip is long, even with three people; be nice, respectful, and in good spirits, because if you piss people off you’ll find yourself with hypothermia and a long three hours to enjoy it.
