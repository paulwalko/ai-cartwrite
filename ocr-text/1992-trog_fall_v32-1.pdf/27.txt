formations, but the entire area looked like it was covered with a swarm of snakes!
Long brown snakes were coiled around the formations and entangled with each other.
After looking closer I realized they were just roots. It's too bad Fifi wasn't on this trip.
After looking at some very discouraging high leads it was time to get down to
business: the tight lead. It was long and narrow with several S-shaped curves in it, and
about 10 to 15 feet ahead it curved out of sight to the left. It was blowing a good bit of
air, and it was heading towards a very well-known, very vertical cave in the area. The
fever was beginning to come upon us. The first curve was the trickiest, and after we all
tried it, Dave found a position that seemed to work. (Patty, were we supposed to put a
comment about your cute ass here? I can never remember where the cute ass
comments are supposed to go.--ed) So after taking off all my clothes, in Dave went. It
was a very tricky section and I knew Dave better remember exactly how he got in there
or I'd never get him out. oooppppss! Wrong Story. Sorry Folks. ...And now back to
our regularly scheduled article... So after taking off my shoes and my jacket, in I went.
It was a very tricky section and I knew I had to remember exactly how I got into it or I
would never get out. Those of you who have pushed tight leads know what it's like.
Part of your mind is concentrating on what you're doing as you move inch by inch, and
the other part of your mind is thinking of what would have to be done to get you out if
you got stuck. It is usually more of an emotional, rather than physical, drain.
Finally I was almost to the bend at the end. In my mind I could see huge
walking passage leading to a 100 foot virgin pit. I got to a place where I could stand
and slowly peeked around the corner. The passage closed into a rabbit hole, not much
bigger than a basketball. Sigghhhh... I crawled back out of the squeeze, getting stuck at
the end till Mike started to sweat and then we left the cave.
Why do we keep pushing tight leads when they don't usually go? I suppose it's
for the same reason that people keep buying lottery tickets when they don't usually
win. Though the odds are slim, it's not impossible and I figure it's almost my turn to
win. Next time it'll go, I can feel it.
