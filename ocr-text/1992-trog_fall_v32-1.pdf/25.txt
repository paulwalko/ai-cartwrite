scooped this passage a year earlier, but it was close enough to virgin for me.
Several hours, several survey stations, and several hundred feet later, we reached
the end the canyon: a sump. No one felt like pushing the sump, so we turned around
and went back. Back up to the top of Kirk's Chasm (and once again slimed!), I (the
official trip wimp) prodded us to leave the cave instead of scoopin' some booty. After
we got out, as I stood by Dave's car, admiring the silhouette of the hillsides against the
night sky, and drinking the world's best beer - beer someone else bought, I was proud to
be the trip wimp!

FOR MEN ONLY ....
WHAT IS PHALLO-PLASTY?
We are pleased to announce that we are now offering the
NEWEST procedure in cosmetic surgery for men by our
Surgery of Intimacy Institute Division. This is an
enhancement procedure that is simple, 'safe and very
effective in increasing the size of the penile SHAFT. NO
foreign material or implant is used. This procedure does
not interfere with sensation or function and is done on an
out-patient basis. Healing is rapid and virtually pain free.
HOW IS PHALLO-PLASTY
PERFORMED?
Using MICRO LIPO (fat) sculpture which has evolved from
liposuction, the person's own refined and treated fat is
injected beneath the penile skin to augment the size.
