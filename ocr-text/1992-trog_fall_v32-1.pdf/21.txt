C. Seats, Harnesses, Elc.
V. Rappelling Standards
1. All seats and hamesses are to be tied as directed in the
VPI Cave Club New Member Issue using 1" tubular webbing
(as a minimum size) having a tensile strength of 4000 lb or
greater.
A. When people arrive at the bridge they are collectively told of the
process of how the "Bridge Sessions are operated. The Member-In-
Charge is pointed out along with the other members.
2. Sewn or purchased climbing hamesses are also acceptable. This type of seat
shall have redundancy in case of failure and withstand an UIAA rated fall. The seat
is also to be approved by The Member-In-Charge.
1. They are shown how to tie a seat for rappelling. We show
how the seat works and its safety features. All of the individual
knots needed to tie a seat are introduced to them so they can
begin to learn them.
3. Before anyone other than a Member goes up or down a rope their seat is to be
inspected by a Member to ensure that it is tied or put on correctly.
2. The participants are given a locking carabiner which will
connect the rappelling device to their seat. We also give them a
descending device (usually an eight because of its simple
operation and high safety factor) and show them how it is used.
D. Vertical Gear
1. Carabiners: shall have a tensile strength of 1500 lb or
greater. Locking carabiners shall be used at all times unless
otherwise specified by The Member-In-Charge.
3. The participants are told how all of the gear is used at the
bridge, the strengths of the gear, the safety factors built into
the gear, and any added safety features (such as a bottom
belay).The techniques used at the bridge are also demonstrated.
2. Descenders: "Eights" & "Racks" are standard rappelling devices to be used.
Any other device must be approved by The Member-In-Charge.
4. We then have them put on a helmet and gloves.
3. Ascenders: are to be of "knot", "prussik", or "mechanical"
type approved by The Member-in-Charge.
5. We then describe & illustrate a system of called commands
that are used when rappelling or ascending. These calls are
outlined for you on page 10. These commands ensure the safety
of the participants. Everyone is required to go through these
commands every time they ascend or descend. The bottom
belay is required for all participants.
4. Ropes:
a. All ropes to be used at the bridge are to be "Goldline"
laid rope or an approved static rope made for rappelling.
The static kermantle ropes must have a minimum tensile
strength of 5000 lb.
b. Any webbing used at the bridge shall be 1" tubular or
2" flat (as a minimum) and have a minimum tensile
strength of 3500 lb.
6. A Member in then situated at the bottom of the bridge
(out of rockfall zone) to supervise all of the belayers. The
belayer will stop the rappeller on rope (by pulling the rope
taught) if there are any problems. They will also make sure
everyone at the bottom of the bridge is out of the rockfall
zone and if someone needs to be in it they will wear proper
headgear.
c. Any cable ladders used at the bridge must at the least
have a tensile strength of 500 lbs. It will generally be
made of two stainless steel cables with aluminum rungs.
d. To prevent a possible failure of the rigging none of the
ropes, cable ladders, or other riggings will be rigged to
a defective or wom part of the bridge.
7. Another Member is stationed at the top of the bridge 16
ensure that all participants rigs into the rope correctly, that all
Non-Members have tied their seats properly, that helmets
& gloves are worn by all participants, and the proper call
commands are used by all participants. The Member will
also observe the rappeller on his/her descent to provide
any necessary instruction or assistance.
d. Only knots shown in our New Member Issue or
"On Rope" by Allen Padgett are to be used in rigging
a rope.
e. All ropes are to be "padded" from the bridge surface to
prevent rope wear and possible failure.
8. The Member-In-Charge is to ensure that the above conditions
are met, supervise cable ladder belays, the bridge surface is
kept dear of hazards, and the area is clean & undamaged after
the "Bridge Session".
f. All rigging is to include friction wraps (or equivalent) to
ensure that knot used in rigging is not unduly loaded.
g. All final rigging is to be approved by The Member-In-Charge and if
necessary,any Members in attendance.
9. General: No "bouncing" while on rope is permitted due to the
possible damage to and failure of the rope.
The actual process of rappelling down the rope may vary due to
the type of descending equipment used.
5. Gloves: are to be worn by all participants ascending or rappelling, cable
ladder belaying, or at any other times when necessary to protect an individuals
hands.
