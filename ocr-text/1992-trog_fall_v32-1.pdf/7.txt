Buddy
May 25, 1910 - October 23, 1992
Buddy Penley was a member of the NSS and a Fellow of the VPI Cave Club.
Buddy Penley has been a generous friend of the VPI Cave Club for many years.
Controlling access to much of Skydusky Hollow Buddy met most of us throughout the
years. Caving in Newberry's, Buddy Penley's and Paul Penley's were started in the
early 1950s and continues today. Buddy looked forward to Saturday mornings when
cavers would arrive. He would invite everyone inside to visit awhile before going
underground. I can remember some rainy afternoons that we never made it into the
caves, we just sat for hours sharing stories with Buddy. On numerous occasions cavers
would help him with farm chores. These always turned into an enjoyable activity of
learning from and sharing with Buddy's life time of experiences.
Buddy referred to us as his children from VPI. He looked forward to attending
the yearly VPI banquet where he was always an honored guest. In the spring he would
invite us out to his farm for a spring picnic. An event that started as a Saturday
afternoon and evening affair soon evolved into a weekend campout with families
welcome. Mr. Penley thought there was no better place for us, or our children, than
running around his fields.
Buddy Penley was a unique person and a special friend. He will be fondl√Ω
remembered for offering long nights of caving and leisurely afternoon visits, for hard
work and mostly good conversation, for storytelling and:
