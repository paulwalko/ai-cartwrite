"Bridge Session Policy"
Top Belay: A person is positioned securely above a vertical
drop in which a cable ladder is used. The belayer is usually
in a sitting position with the rope running from a rig point,
through one hand, around the belayer's back, through the
second hand, and down to the climbers seat or waist. If at any
time the climber falls or experiences trouble the belayer can
stop the climbers fall by wrapping the rope around the front
of himself. This belay is controlled by the amount of friction
created between the belayer and the rope.
1. Purpose of "Bridge Sessions"
A. To introduce interested persons or parties to the basics of
rappelling in a safe and controlled way.
B. To introduce prospective members to the skilt of rappelling, for
general education into descending & ascending a rope before
Prospective Members do so underground, and for advanced
training in Single Rope Techniques (SRT): belaying, changeovers, hauling systems,
cable ladders, etc. in a safe and controlled environment.
C. A "Rockfall Zone is a potentially dangerous area at the bottom of
a vertical drop or wall. The Zone extends horizontally outward from
the base of the drop a distance of 15' (at the bridge). The higher the drop
is the larger the Rockfall Zone (in a cave we generally use 25-30").
When a person is inside this zone he/she is at risk from falling objects or from objects
being knocked over the drop.
C. To complete membership requirements that are prescribed in the
VPI Cave Club Constitution and By-Laws.
D. A "Member" is any dues paying member of The VPI Cave Club who
has passed the training program requirements (pgs 11-12) outlined in The VPI Club
Constitution and By-Laws and has been voted in by The VPI Cave Club Members. This is
further broken down into two categories: Full Members (Students, Faculty, Staff, &
Tech Employees) and Associate Members (have passed training requirements but are
not associated with Virginia Tech).
D. Refreshment of techniques to train for vertical rescue capabilities. Our being able to
train at a very accessible, safe environment leaves a very efficient practice.
II. Persons in charge at a "Bridge Sessions"
E. A "Prospective Member' is any person that has been invited by
The VPI Cave Club to enter the training program and become a
Member of The Club.
A. At any given "Bridge Session of The VPI Cave Club there is a
minimum of 3 Full Members or Associate Members in attendance.
B. The Member-In-Charge is The Vice-President of The VPI Cave Club.
The Vice-President is also in charge of the Training Program of The VPI Cave Club

C. The Vice-President will have at least 2 other Members present
to supervise at a "Bridge Session". These members will be under The
Vice-President's Authority. They are to assist in the training
process and to ensure a safe environment for all the participants.
1. All participants descending & ascending shall wear ANSI
approved headgear, with a chinstrap, to protect against head
injuries due to falling objects, falls while on rope, or any other
unforeseen hazard.
D. In the event that the Vice-President cannot be in attendance he/she will appoint a
responsible and knowledgeable replacement to act as A Member-In-Charge.
2. All participants at the base of the bridge within a 15' rockfall
zone (measured horizontally along the ground from a line
projecting down from the edge of the bridge) shall wear ANSI
approved headgear with chinstrap to protect against falling
objects.
III.
Definitions
A. A "Changeover" is the act of switching from descending gear to
ascending gear (or vice versa) while still attached to the rope. The
VPI Cave Club requires a minimum of three points of contact
(attachments) to the rope at all times while doing a changeover,
3. All other participants are to stay out of these areas
completely if they are not wearing proper headgear.
B. Gear Placement at the bridge
B. A belay is any method of stopping a rappeller on rope or catching
fall of someone who is climbing a ladder or wall.
1. All gear is to stay organized at the bridge and not present
a hazard to pedestrians, bystanders, participants, or anyone
else in close proximity.
Bottom Belay: A person is positioned at the bottom of a
rappell, out of the rockfall zone, who will hold the end of the
rope securely in hand. When the rappeller yells "falling", the
belayer sees the rappeller fall, or any other dangerous
situation is encountered the belayer pulls tight the rope. This action
will stop the rappeller instantly.
2. Large sacks, packs, or bulky gear is to remain off the bridge
surface, off campus walkways, and clear of any rockfall zones.
3. Any other gear pertinent to rappellers on top of the bridge
is to be compact, neatly organized, on one side of the bridge
only (so as not to hamper pedestrian flow), and secured as to
eliminate hazard to persons below.
