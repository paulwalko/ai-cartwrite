Veep's View
Another semester & year is coming to an end. While everyone is stressing out
over finals & whether or not they will pass we should look to the spring & the caving
opportunities still out there. Many of the new prospective members will be ready for
membership. We will also be on our annual spring break TAG trip. If you're a
prospective member you should get your full membership before then ( more incentive
to get membership ). It's a lot of fun ( and quite a bit of bitching, too---ed. ) & you
will definitely see a different cave environment.
Hopefully!!! ... we will also regain our privilege of using the bridge for Friday
bridge sessions. But...who knows...this could become a generational movement in which
your grandchild could hear about the tragic day in October of â€™92 when the bridge was
taken away and of the ongoing fight to regain it. Until then Steve and I have found an
interesting rappelling spot out in Newport. We will probably be going there every other
weekend starting next semester. We will continue to help everyone with knots & caving
information at the Friday Night Speleo-seminars, so if you want to learn any of this you
need to show up. Remember, none of us ever stops learning.
Let's keep up the momentum. Thanks to all of the members for taking trips &
helping at the bridge. You know who you are. Extra kudos to Bob for the now regular
Thursday night trips. Who knows, maybe I'll be crazy enough to go with you
sometime.
I WANT TO SEE MANY NEW MEMBERS NEXT SEMESTER
