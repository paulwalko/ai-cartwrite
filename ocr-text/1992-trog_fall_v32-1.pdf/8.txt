Prunes and Grape Jelly
Well, I'm afraid this year the vineyard fairy didn't leave anything under my
door, so ya'll are gonna have to settle for me a-writing a piece here in the space reserved
in yer usual Trog for the Grapevine. As I see it, there are only a couple of important
things that need mentioning, so here goes.
Someone many of us hold dear in their hearts passed away this year. Buddy
Penley, a man who has given us many hours of stories, laughs, and good times died
October 23, 1992 at the age of 82. I remember the first time I went to Newberry's; it
was pouring down raining and I was but a lowly worm among greatness...one of 15
cavers converging upon the cave to finish some survey work. Among the participants
were Carol and Joe, Doug, Jerry, Ko, Phillip, Paul, Berta...and me. It was my third
caving experience and I was filled with apprehension, that is until I was introduced to
Buddy. How this wizened old character could have a smile and jovial expression on this
grim day made me wonder in amazement, and his kind words and friendly nature
helped disperse the butterflies I felt. That was Buddy, smiles and warm handshakes
around, especially for the ladies. Buddy, we'll all miss you. Take care.
Banquet. Yes, we are supposed to have one. Yes, it is supposed to be at
Custom Caterers off North Main. Yes, it is going to be in February. No, I don't know
the exact date. Probably the 13th or the 20th. Ask Chummer.
The Constipation has finally passed. After a lot of work, lots of methyl alcohol,
and 5 minutes of rigged voting it went through like Montezuma's Revenge. A grim
analogy to be sure, but appropriate. A big ol' warm fuzzy (McGeehan, you should get.
that joke, you too French.---ed.) to all those involved and they deserve it. After all, it
is not an easy task to assemble something that looks all the world to be a bill from
Congress. If you don't believe me, just look at it - it's in here somewhere. Hopefully,
this will be the last time something like this has to be done, at least the last time for
the current President, right? I thought so.
Well, that's about it as I see it. Perhaps next time ya'll will get what ya were
lookin' for, I dunno. Perhaps we'll just have to wait and see, eh?
