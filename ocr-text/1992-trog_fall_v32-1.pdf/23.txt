B. Generally, 2-3 ropes are rigged for rappellers and 2-3 ropes are
rigged for ascending (the rappelling ropes are opposite the ascending
ropes on the bridge so as to group the similar activities).
BELAY CALLS
C. Weather: "Bridge Sessions" are safely held in most weather
conditions (cold, rain, snow, sleet, wind). We will not hold a bridge
session in hazardous weather (lightning storm, tornado, hurricane, or
any other condition which would put participants at risk.
D. "Bridge Session" times have generally been every Friday afternoon
while school is in session. We have started around 2pm and end
7pm (at dark in the Fall and Winter).
When tossing a rope down a drop:
Rope
(wait for answer)
Clear
(People below are out of way and rope may be tossed)
Rappeling:
Ready to Rappel (rappeller ready to start rappel)
Belay On
(belayer is ready for rappeler to start)
Rappeling
(rappeler is starting rappel)
Rappel Away (belayer understands rappeler has started)
E. None of the participants will be allowed to climb on any of the
nearby structures (buildings, bridge columns, etc.).
Down
Off Rope
(rappeler is on bottom and belay is off)
(reppeler is no longer on rope, he or she is out of rock fall
zone, and next person may rig in)
F. Any Member or Perspective Member of The VPI Cave Club that does not abide by these
policies or any other policy outlined in The VPI Cave Club Constitution and By-Laws will
be disciplined according the The VPI Cave Club Constitution and By-Laws. Any other
participant at the bridge not yet affiliated with The VPI Cave Club will be asked to
leave the bridge and not to return if any infraction of this policy takes place.
Prussiking:

Tension
A. The Vice-President of The VPI Cave Club is elected every spring
by the voting members of the VPI Cave Club. All voting members
passed the Membership Requirements set by The Club. The
Vice-President historically has been someone who the Club feels can
safely & properly train new individuals and introduce them to caving.
This person does not necessarily know everything about vertical
techniques but has a competent knowledge, constructive attitude,
and can effectively show & teach by providing a safe learning
environment, proper techniques, and proper equipment.
Slack
Falling
(climber wants support of rope for a manuever where he
thinks he might fall or there is too much slack)
(climber wants some slack in the rope)
(climber has fallen)
Off Belay
Belay Off
Off Rope
(climber no longer needs belay)
(belayer no longer assumes responsibility for climber)
(climber is no longer rigged into rope and is away, from edge
of drop)
Others:
Rock
B. The Training Program that prepares persons for Full Membership
in The Club is founded on the use of a vertical practice area. We feel
that The Bridge offers the best educational possibilities: controlled
working environment, ease of access to top & bottom of structure,
ease for talking to sometimes large groups of people who need to
observe as well as actively take part, it allows for a great number of
ropes to be rigged at one time to facilitate efficiency and great
activity, and lastly (but importantly) allows us to be visible to the
students on campus. We estimate that 50%-70% of all the new Cave Club
Members find out about us by seeing us there.
Equipment
(A rock or other object has been dropped or kicked loose
down a drop)
(equipment will be sent down the drop. One should wait for
a reply of Clear before sending it down.)
All other talking, by both the climbers and the rest of the party, should be kept at a
minimum; especially where echo of sound absorpttion by mud, etc., makes
communication difficult.
C. We realize how much Virginia Tech has attributed to the growth
and success of The VPI Cave Club since its conception as a Charter
Member of The National Speological Association in 1942. While we
were allowed to use the bridge we presented a sale, clean, and
positive image for Virginia Tech which we feel would continue if
allowed once again to use the bridge.
