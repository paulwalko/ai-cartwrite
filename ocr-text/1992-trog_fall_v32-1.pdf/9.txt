Seven Year Itch
Whoa, check it out. I finally got around to drawing this map up. Hmm, here's
what I remember (hey kids, check out the dates).
The entrance is in a stream bed. Don't go if it's been raining, or you will not
find the entrance--don't go if it's gonna rain or no one will find you (except possibly in
Old Mill). No kidding, this cave is, equivalent to the pipe leading from your toilet. Go
after it has been flushed, but before the bowl fills. More advice: don't touch the ceiling
or dirt and leaves will rain down on you.
I apologize for the lack of detail in the map, but there's nothing in there, and
besides, it really doesn't matter -- the lower portion of this cave is as dynamic as a
Tasmanian Devil on PCP.
If You Choose to Cave......
