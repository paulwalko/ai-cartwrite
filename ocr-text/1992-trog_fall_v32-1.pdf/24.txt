Trip Report: New Starnes
On Saturday, November 21, 1992, Dave Colatosti, Kirk Digby, Doug Bruce, Sue
Setzler, Paul Gillis, and myself went surveying in New Starnes. It was a good way to
start Thanksgiving break. I thought it was pretty fun. I thought I'd write about it.
I've got nothing better to do.
The trip began for me the night before, when Kirk and myself were sitting
around after the party trying to convince each other not to caving tomorrow: "If you
wimp out, I'll back you up!"
Unfortunately, suffering that morning from that judgment impairment that
affects people when they have not had enough sleep, or when they've just smoked
enough dope to get the entire population of Africa uncontrollably laughing, we decided
to go caving. So, we packed our crap, and in true expeditious form, we arrived at
signout 20 minutes after our "proposed” meeting time. Fortunately, Kirk and myself
were not alone in out lethargic style - we were the first people there from our trip. I
love it when everyone is operating on ”Caver Standard Time”!
After some early morning cholesterol at Hardee's, and changing clothes in the
rain, we finally made it underground! Soon thereafter, we got a little "warm-up
exercise” in the two hour Humble Pie crawl. The crawl is not that bad anymore, after
some larger cavers went through it with excavating equipment. However, it still is
"fun".
One of the first features you see upon entering the New Section is some lovely
looking breakdown and mud, set against a flowstone wall waterfall. At this point,
called ” Andrew's Dice and Clay", we split up into two survey crews. Doug, Sue, and
Kirk headed to the passage on top of the waterfall. Dave, Paul, and myself set out
surveying down through the mud and rock breakdown pile, which seems to be a lot
more mud than rock. Needless to say, once we passed down through this breakdown
pile drop, known as "Kirk's Chasm”, we were slimed!
However, going through Kirk's Chasm was worthwhile. At the bottom is a large
room, with a fast flowing stream. We followed the stream a little ways through a 20'
crawl that left nothing but our torsos dry (but at least washed the mud off us), and
then entered this beautiful, large trunk passage. The passage is tall and narrow, with
lots of mud covered chert on the sides, and the stream on the bottom. Paul named the
place "Chert River Canyon”. Unfortunately for Paul and myself, Dave and Kirk had
