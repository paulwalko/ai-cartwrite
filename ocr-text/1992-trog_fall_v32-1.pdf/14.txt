The benefits of the frog are apparent to those that have ever gotten to the knot
at the end of the rope and found their feet still in the air. Changeovers are a breeze,
down to up or up to down; even with a figure eight. Passing knots, evil lips, and
especially rebelays is not as big of a deal as with other systems. The whole rig remains
attached to your harness at all times; when you put on your harness to abseil (oooh
weird word) you are automatically set up for ascent. In a Mexican cave called Rio Choi
(sp?) Jerry Redder challenged me to rappel, changeover, and ascend the approximately
200 ft pitch in under twenty minutes, for a beer. I did it in seven (maybe less but my
mind is going).
“On Rope”, the current vertical techniques tome published by the NSS, has this
to say in summary about the frog:
”Even though the system is heavy, bulky and relatively slow, it is an essential
part of the European style of ropework and has become the dominant climbing
system used by an entire continent."
Standing offer: whoever agrees with the heavy, bulky, slow part of the above, let's
compare rigs. There must be some reason an "entire continent” uses it. Elvis would
have used a frog.
