Kable Ladder Karma
One of the great mysteries of caving for me since I started has been how do I roll
a cable ladder. Since I have recently taken partial charge of the gear at signout it has
become apparent to me that this is one of the great mysteries for many of you as well.
I remember when I was a lowly trainee how I would be handed a ladder on a trip
or at the bridge and told to roll it. I would respectfully and humbly ask one of the
eminent members how I would go about turning this mass of cable and tubing into a
nice compact little ball. The answer usually came in a resounding “Just roll it up.”
Upon my own membership I found out why this was so, and when I used a ladder on
my trainee trips I found myself giving it to some poor, unsuspecting bastard to roll.
Soon I found myself on trips where members would find themselves without
anyone on which to dump this task. Occasionally there would be one brave or ignorant
soul who would actually volunteer. Occasionally the ladder would actually be rolled in
a way it wouldn't fall apart. In my “short” tenure here at Tech I've seen many ways
(sometimes very original and artistic), and I've tried to copy the ways that worked
before. However, these previous rolls were obviously the work of someone involved with
the occult. I personally have no desire to drag a live chicken through the cave just so
that I can roll a stupid ladder. On a recent trip to Spring Hollow the karma of the
ladder was revealed to me. Actually I'd seen it done this way before, but I've always
been blowing the karma (now you can look at the picture)
Wind to rungs for every revolution of the roll bunching the rungs on either side.
Twist the ladder once between every rung as you roll the ladder. At first, place the
latest rung just past the group; as the roll gets larger this will not be possible and the
rungs will go just behind the preceding. The links at the end of the ladder should come
in between the cables and act as a guide. Always put the point where the cables cross
just past where the links come out. As the roll gets larger the whole conglomeration
will become flatter, and rolling becomes more difficult toward the end. Use a biner to
secure the outside end of the ladder to the roll. As long as the whole thing is kept
pretty tight as it is rolled this process is very repeatable.
