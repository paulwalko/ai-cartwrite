The Frog Ascending Deal
When I first came to Tech and started caving with the club, vertical techniques
were taught much as they are today. During the years the “Young Republicans” were
around, there was a lot of interest in non-traditional (for North American types)
ascending and rappelling methods. The standard ascending methods were prussiks,
rope-walkers, and a few Texas rigs, with some combinations and bastardizations of the
aforementioned styles. Since I graduated, it seems that these styles dominate the club
once again. After sensing interest in learning how to create the French ascending rig
known as a frog, I figured I'd write this deal. I've also received comments about my
(sketchy" techniques by people who don't know squat about anything outside the VPI
Cave Club. Sue Setzler and Doug Bruce kicked major butt at convention on a hyped-
out version of this rig.
The frog utilizes two ascenders attached to the rope with one attached at your
harness and one higher attached to a footloop and your harness (look at the bitchin'
drawing). This arrangement results in a sit-stand motion for ascent, and a very flexible
rig for any type of pitch, no matter how convoluted. After one half-assed pseudo-frog
using a Gibbs with no spring as the top piece (whoa nelly, it slipped) and a Petzl
Jammer at my waist, I bought a Petzl Croll and came up with a reasonable, safe rig.
The Croll is designed to be used at the waist, and the Jammer as the top piece.
My current rig consists of a Petzl Croll and Jammer (no handle), two Maillon
Rapides (medium steel oval and large aluminum triangle), approximately 7 ft of 9mm
cord, approx. 5 ft of 5-6mm cord, 6 ft of bungi cord (1/4"), and a loop of 1" webbing.
The 9mm cord is used to tie a cow-tail: one end attached to your harness; the other
attached to the Jammer via the oval Maillon Rapide. This should be tied such that the
Jammer is not beyond your reach with your weight on it. The 6mm cord should be tied
in a loop at one end, big enough to serve as a prussik on the cow-tail. Use a true
prussik with about three full wraps and make it tighter than if you were using it on the
standing line for ascent, removing any slip potential. This is to be the attachment of
the foot loop to the cow-tail. The prussik knot will allow adjustment for differing
situations, or to adjust for other people. The other end should be tied to the loop of
webbing. Make this loop big enough for both feet to be easily inserted and removed
without using your hands. Some people like separate loops for each foot on separate
lines to the cow-tail. This is excessive in most cases. The Croll is to be attached as low
as possible to your harness; I use the triangle. Attach the bungi cord to the top hole, go
