H. The last time you explored a tight cave passage was...
1. less than a year ago.
2. more than a year ago.
3. at birth.

In your opinion, a good cave entrance is...
1. Located fairly far away from parking, so as not to be found by many “nard
cavers”. However, more importantly, so you can do things such as go on an 126
hour stream-crawl dig trip and come out to find out that 74 inches of snow has
fallen while you were underground and the outside temperature has dropped to
38.5 degrees below zero, which caused all your wet clothes to instantly become
sheets of solid ice, lowering your body temperature to 32 degrees, which caused
all your limbs to become immobile, so that you had no choice but to roll on the
ground back to your car, which would not have not been so bad if you were not
blind due to the snow and rolled of a 30' cliff, which also would not have been
so bad if you did not have time to cross the farmer's bull field, where you were
gored several times by what appeared to be musk oxen in heat, and then of
course your battery was dead and you had to rip down a local power line with
your teeth to jump start your car.... (Dave apparently has a death wish--ed.
2. Located fairly close to parking and easy to get to, so as to avoid any male musk
oxen in heat, if nothing else.
3. Filled in with concrete.
A cave trip you take should be...
'1. challenging and exciting.
2. enjoyable and relaxing.
3 a figment of your imagination.
Now add up your score.

You are
Lying
A boring person
Legally dead
A moron
Unless you are a moron, you're a good caver. If you are a moron, you would not be able
to find a cave anyway.
