The Pusher
“Hey Patty, we have tight lead we want you to check out.” Those words
provoke the same sort of fevered addiction that a $500,000,000.00 lottery would. (yeah,
right--ed) Until the lead fizzles out or until the numbers are drawn there is always the
hope of hitting the jackpot and finding the gold mine. It's amazing what some people
will go through ( no pun intended) to find virgin passage. (you mean, like, a virgin?--ed)
"If only I could (pant, pant) move forward another two inches (grunt, grunt) I could see
around this next bend."
One beautiful, sunny, warm summer day, Dave Colatosti, Mike Mike Mike, and
I decided ti head out towards Newcastle and explore several small caves, one of which
had a tight lead in it. As we were ridgedriving along Dave kept sighing and saying
things like “Gee, it sure is a shame to spend a sunny day like this underground." or
“Hey, I just got my rock climbing shoes fixed. We could stop by Fool's Face on the
way." Of course, Mike Mike Mike and I knew not to give Dave the slightest bit of
encouragement and eventually we pulled into Mr. Sizer's yard. After chatting for a
while, Mr Sizer's son, Andy, decided to join us while we poked into a few holes.
First, we went to a fairly small cave with a rat shit dig at the end of it. It didn't
seem to be blowing any air and we could hear Mr. Sizer on his tractor mowing hay
above us. We backed out of it and after emptying rat pellets from our shirts we
proceeded to “The Hole That Opened Up A Few Years Back”. After climbing down
between roots with dirt clods still hanging to them I could see the entrance. It
reminded me of Floyd Collins' story. There was one big rock hanging over the entrance
sort of wedged in place with a couple of smaller rocks. It looked as though the wind
could blow it down. Dave assured us it was okay as long as we didn't touch it! So we
slithered into the cave one by one, trying to ignore the hairy, mushy, dead smelling
stuff we had to crawl through to avoid touching the entrance rock.
Just inside the entrance was standing room and I looked in awe at the roots.
They came straight down from the ceiling to the floor like the poles on a merry-go-
round. I had this (almost) irresistible urge to reach out and thunk one of them with my
finger. They had the same sort of fatal attraction that a "wet paint” sign has. I shook
myself from my reverie and moved into a more stable part of the cave. We crawled and
duck-walked through most of the cave. Towards one end of it I saw something I've
never seen in the short time I've been caving. There was a pretty section with some
