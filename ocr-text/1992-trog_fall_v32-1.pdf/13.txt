over both shoulders and attach to the back of your harness. When standing straight up
with both feet in the footloop, the Jammer should rest on top of the Croll. When
hanging on the rope via the Croll, slide the Jammer up as far as possible. You should
be able to put your feet in the footloop. If the loop is too high, slide the prussik down.
My footloop and prussik cord are about the same length as the cow-tail. As with all
systems, the fit to each person is an iterative process. Start with more than you need in
length and reduce until it feels correct. Don't cut the excess too soon.
The person who showed me this rig, Alejandro Villagomez, uses an inflated
bicycle tube over his shoulders for comfort, instead of the bungi cord. He also uses a
Kong-Bonatti handled ascender for his top piece. I have found the handle-less Jammer
to be more compact and comfortable than any other handled ascender. The standard
set-up as marketed by Petzl requires a chest harness. For “shorter” pitches, this can be
omitted and bungi cord can be used. A chest harness definitely improves the efficiency
of the system. The length of the cow-tail can be increased beyond easy reach for more
distance with each cycle. One can move the footloop down on the cow-tail and step up
to the upper ascender should the need arise. This should be experimented with by the
individual before getting into too much trouble. Like all other systems, the basic
concept of the frog is open to improvisation in tune with your specific needs. The whole
thing is adjustable, and can be torn down into constituent parts for emergencies,
though your knots may not necessarily agree.
There was a lot of controversy in the club about this system. People bitched
about the two points of contact on the rope, including my caving buddy and fellow gear
geek Craig Roberts. I was the only one besides Alejandro using the system and began a
quest of opening minds. Soon Mr. Roberts saw the light and we began rigging all sorts
of crazed rope obstacles together, testing our abilities to overcome any and all weird
atrocities of knot-work under the bridge by Smythe, challenging others to try with their
rigs. A number of new trainees/members soon created their own frog design. The frog
demands some physical conditioning which is not really needed for the ropewalker.
After using the frog on 500+ ft. pits in Mexico and Fern in Alabama, I decided rope-
walkers have their place on long straightforward pitches. There has been discussion
about the bounce on the rope. Rope abrasion is something that definitely needs to be
addressed with this system. The rope should always hang as free as possible. European
cavers use large scale bolting as a means of conquering rope abrasion, not necessarily
appropriate by our conservation standards. I don't think that frogging bounces the rope
any more than using knots as far as intensity, though the frequency achieved is higher.
