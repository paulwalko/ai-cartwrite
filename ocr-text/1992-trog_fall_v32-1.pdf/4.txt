Letter from Mom
Dear Cave Club,
This has been a fairly action packed semester. First of all, the new constitution
was passed after almost a year's worth of work. I'd like to thank everyone that helped
with the comments, suggestions and proofreading. You might find a copy of it in this
Trog (maybe you will, and maybe you won't; but you'll never know, will you?--ed.)
and I encourage everyone to read it thoroughly. Secondly, we were banned from using
the bridge for our Friday afternoon training sessions. This was not due to anything the
Cave Club did or did not do, but was due to a university wide policy that prohibits it.
(the 1972 letter giving us permission had expired!) We are currently involved in
negotiations with the administration and it looks like this won't be resolved until after
Christmas. In the meantime we are having a hard time training new people so any
suggestions for places to practice vertical work would be appreciated (how about the
ROTC tower? I'll bring the munitions...---ed.). Thirdly, signout was moved from
Cecil's house to the Green Street Apartments. It's a convenient set-up, with club gear
(most oâ€™ it) carbide and the signout sheet all in one easy-to-access location. Thanks to
everyone who helped put it together, thanks to residents there who volunteered to keep
an eye on the sign-in times (suckers) and thanks to Cecil for all the years of putting up
with us at the old signout.
Well, no new members were voted in this semester (lame-os), but we have a
great crop of trainees that are making good progress towards next semester. (hey, what
the @#$% happened to all of their @#$%ing articles? we for some, would like to know.
Humphf---ed.) We have a practice rescue planned for December sixth in Starnes, and a
possible itical practice rescue in the spring. Ko (sucker) has volunteered to do a
couple of programs leading up to vertical practice rescue so maybe this one will happen!
Until then, let's see some more trainee trips and more new people involved in surveying.
If everyone gives a little, the club can get a lot (heh heh). Speleo-seminar Hardy you
cave slaves!
Mom
