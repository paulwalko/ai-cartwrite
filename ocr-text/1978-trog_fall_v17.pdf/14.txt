Number One Was .....
Ever wonder how the VPI Cave Club's membership number
system started?
Research in the club files turned up the following
reports given when the numbering system was initiated:
minutes Oct. 23, 1964:
Gary McCutchen- Membership Committee- "There are two
signifiacant plans for changing the membership cards: one
to change the wording Virginia Polytechnic Institute to
VPI Cave Club; two, to give the standing members numbers
for their cards, beginning with the oldest members. (This
is to keep a perminant list of club members.) Also the cards
may have color. The above mentioned plans were made into a
motion and passed. A motion was also made and seconded to
have an imprint of the Troglodyte, the 'Hairy Ape'."
Ninutes Nov. 6, 1964
Membership Card Committee- "The new membership cards
were presented along with the number system. Tom Bell moved
that the numbers be accepted as they stand. The motion was
seconded by Whitt Whittemore and passed by the club."
The numbers given to current members at the beginning of
the numbering system were not in chronilogical order and members
before the fall 1963 were not included unless they returned
as dues paying members.
The club reached number 208 this November.
That about number 12, 19, 51, 81,or 91 not to forget
number 115, 121, 128, 149, or 155 ? If you go to a Virginia
Region meeting, NSS Convention or old Timers reunion you may
run across many of these VPI'ers. Not to mention the numbers
that show up at the Cave Club Banquet in February or that slip
into the seats in the back of the meeting hall on Friday
nights.
