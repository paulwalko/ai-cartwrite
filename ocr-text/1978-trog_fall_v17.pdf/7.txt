Grotto Grapevine

Within the last nine months, so much has happened
that it is difficult to write it all down so here are the
highlights:
Picnic weekend began cold and gray. It ended, cold
and gray. Float trip went well with perfect weather and a
new course down the New River from Pearisburg to Richcreek.
There were the usual minor mishaps that accompany all float
trips -- not enough beer, the loss of some rafts and canoes
at a small, but exciting, set of rapids, and some isolated
cases of sunburn. Compliments go to Admiral Jerry Redder
for a float trip well done.
Float trip party also had its memorable moments.
The Christiansburg house will never be the same. Between
Chuck Shorten's violent attack on the screen door and sev-
eral others' taking out their frustrations on a wall, it is
a wonder the place is still standing.
Old Timers' Reunion was exciting, with the only pro-
blem being a slight shortage of wine (met with wild cries of
"More wine!"). VPI cavers and alumni won most of the awards
(again): Dennis Vaders took first place overall and won a huge
sleeping bag; Ed Devine came in second and received a tent;
Chuck Shorten was third and won a Wheat lamp. Among the
alumni who won: Janet Queisser and Annie Whittemore. Current
member Joe Zokaites also was a winner. (Cheryl Jones and
Annie Whittemore are running next year's Old Timers'.)
Mike Frame's hometown of Birch River, West Virginia,
was the site of a four-wheel drive rally this summer. Carl
Hamm, Chuck Shorten, Jim Denton, Tock and Carol Bearden,
Randy and Cathy Woo√§ and Suzanne and Mike Rame brought their
vehicles for a weekend of fun in the mud.
Fall began with John Deck celebrating his 25th birth-
day at the Hokie House by buying several rounds of beer for
everyone. Two weeks later, Mike Richardson celebrated his
25th. Ed Devine and Chuck Shorten had a keg party two weeks
later for their 22nd birthdays. That's a lot of birthdays and
beer!
