ORGANISMS FOUND IN CAVE WATERS
Heterotrophic microorganisms
Cave waters usually contain a limited amount of organic material, and
this limited energy source is utilized by heterotrophic microorganisms.
Bacteria, algae, and fungi are all found in cave waters. of particular in-
terest to the microbial ecologist are the coliform bacteria found in the
waters of polluted cave systems. One study compared the waters of a cave
contaminated by septic tank leakage to those of a similar yet unpolluted
cave water system. The difference in the numbers of coliforms was quite
pronounced (Holsinger, 1966). Other sources of organic material in cave :
waters are: accumulations of wood and debris brought in by periodic flood-
ing, feces from bats and other visiting mammals, and the decaying bodies of
bats and cave insects.
Some of the heterotrophic bacteria isolated from dripwater pools in
caves in South Wales are listed in table 1 below:
