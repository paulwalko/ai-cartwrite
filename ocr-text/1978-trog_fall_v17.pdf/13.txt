"If you cannot bear the silence and the darkness,
do not go there; if you dislike black night and yawning
chasms, never make them your profession. If you fear the
sound of water hurrying through crevices toward unknown
and mysterious destinations, do not consider it. Seek out
the sunshine. It is a simple prescription. Avoid the dark-
ness.
It is a simple prescription, but you will not follow
it. You will turn immediately to the darkness. You will
imagine that you are tired of the sunlight; the water that
unnerve you will tug in the ancient recesses of your mind:
the midnight will seem restful -- you will end by going down."
