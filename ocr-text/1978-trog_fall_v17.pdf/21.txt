The Microbiology of
Cave Waters

INTRODUCTION
The microbiology of cave waters is an interesting new
area of study in biospeleology, and many preconceived ideas
are being proved wrong. Early theories contended that cave
waters undergo filtration and consequent sterilization as they
pass through calcareous* strata, and should therefore con-
tain little or no microbial life. This has been shown to
be very wrong; in fact, stream waters may show a microflora
quite similar to that of the surface waters nearby. whe
differences which are the most significant are the total
darkness of caves (hence the lack of obligate photolithotrophs),
the high mineral content of dripwater pools, and the effects
of organic pollution inputs on normal microbial populations.
Three different aquatic systems exist in caves : stream
water, standing dripwater pools, and layers of water found
on the surface of cave walls and formations. There is great
species diversity between the various systems, and bacterial
counts are often several orders of magnitude different
from one water source to the next. One study of sediments
taken from a standing pool and a stream pool showed a popu-
lation of bacteria in the standing pool almost 20 times as
large as that in the stream pool (Dickerson, 1975). This
result seems reasonable, for the high mineral content of the
dripwater pool can supply the energy necessary for a population
of autotrophic bacteria
Much of the current research in cave water microbiology
is directed towards the effects of pollution on cave waters
and the normal microflora of these systems. Other investi-
gations have developed correlations between high bacterial
numbers and animal congregations (Dickerson, 1975). Both
biological and chemical parameters have been used to describe
water quality in caves (Elliot, 1976). Additional research
in this area has been conducted to
