In another study, pools of water with different degrees of organic
input were examined and the presence of coliforms was confirmed (Holsinger,
1966). Four pools were located in Banner's Corner Cave, Virginia and one
was in Chadwell's Cave, Virginia. Banner's Corner Cave, with the exception
of one pool, is grossly contaminated by seepage of septic tank materials
and accordingly supports a large population of coliforms. Chadwell's
Cave is not subject to septic seepage, and its coliforms were attributed to
feedlot runoff. One of the pools in Banner's Corner Cave contained no vism
ible sewage, and its dissolved oxygen content was significantly higher than
those pools visibly polluted.
The single most important feature of this research is the demonstration
that aquatic cave systems can become seriously polluted yet still escape
the notice of most public health or water quality control agencies. Attempts
must be made to trace pollution sources which affect cave waters, for these
waters inevitably flow into and contribute to the pollution of other surface
water systems,
In the city of Bowling Green, Kentucky, one researcher examined the
quality of water in seven caves using both chemical and biological para-
meters (Elliot, 1976). In this report it was suggested that the total
coliform count might be a more reliable indicator of pollution than the
fecal coliform count. For all seven of the cave systems studied, total
coliform counts were over 5,000/ml, the maximum permissable by the Kentucky
Water Commission for a public water supply. Serious issues are raised
when, despite this evidence, no standardy exist for cave waters.
CONCLUSIONS AND COMMENTS
The waters of cave systems are far from sterile, as was thought by
early investigators. Populations of heterotrophic and autotrophic
