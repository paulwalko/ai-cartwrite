down house somewhere near the area in which we cave. This
would provide an excellent place for weary cavers to stay
instead of driving fifty miles back from caving in Skydusky
Hollow at 2:30 in the morning. It would be a place where
cavers could gather to enjoy (?) company of other cavers.
We would always have a great party place for Banquet, Float
Trip, or Halloween Party. It would prove an exciting way
for students stuck in the dorms to escape for the weekend.
It could be an excellant liason between VPI Grotto and other
VAR cavers as they would have a place to stay in this caving
area they could use. The success other grottos have had with
field houses inspires this idea. We might even be able to
charge a slight fee for using the place and possibly make
a profit. It would undoutedly interest many of the VPI Grotto
alumni into becoming active again. anyway, it should be a good
topic of discussion at the Hokie House after the Friday meeting
over a pitcher of beer.
Well, I had a few other things which I was going to say,
but this column is getting too long anyway so Editor Bob
Alderson woul probably cut them out. Besides, that will leave
something for the winter Trog. Good Caving!
