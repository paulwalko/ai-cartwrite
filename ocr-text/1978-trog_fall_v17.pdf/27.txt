Iron bacteria may be presente
In case A bacteria play a central role as both decomposers and producers.
Case B presents the bacteria as decomposers only. Both of these microeco-
systems could exist in any cave.
PRODUCTS OF CAVE WATER MICROORGANISMS
Several products are a direct result of the metabolism of microbes in
cave waters, and of particular interest here are the antibiotics, vitamins,
and odors.
Antibiotics
As early as the 16th and 17th centuries a mineral found in caves called
"moonmilk" was used to stop bleeding and as a dehydrating agent (Moore and
Nicholas, 1966).
It was later found that actinomycetes isolated from water
drippings of the cheese-like calcite mineral have antibiotic capacities.
Several species of green and blue-green algae have been found associated
with moonmilk. Production of this mineral is caused by an upset chemical
equilibria in the normal formation of the calcite crystal, and the antibiotic-
producing actinomycetes are responsible for this (Caumartin, 1963).
Vitamins
Another product of cave water (and soil, predominantly) microorganisms
is the vitamins which are required for the growth of certain troglobitic
species. The Thiobacteria commonly found in cave soils and waters are
capable of synthesizing substances such as nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid,
riboflavin, pyridoxine, and vitamin B Vandel, 1965). The ability to pro-
duce vitamins is not unique to microbes of the cave environment, however,
as similar capacities have been demonstrated in surface soils.
