"What kind?" I asked.
Chuck, not being fond of snakes, replied in absolute terror,
with some obscene remark.
I saw it was a garter snake and swore never to let Chuck
forget it. The snake jumped down the hole and Chuck allowed
Dennis to finish digging.
Actually, it was time for Dennis to take a break, but
Dennis didn't know what it was to stop once he had started dig-
ging. Chuck and I took the rocks away as Dennis passed them to
us. Meanwhile, the sun got closer to the horizon and the air got
a night chill.
Dennis announced if we could remove one more boulder, the
hole would be open. We gave him a retired piece of tenstrong,
he tied it around the boulder. Just as Chuck and I prepared
to pull like hell, Dennis knocked loose one or two smaller rocks
and all I saw was the end of the tens trong disappearing down the
entrance. This was followed by a thud.
Now the hole was big enough for Bill (Stringfellow) or Gary
(Moss) to get through.
Again, we donned our caving gear. Chuck told Dennis he could
go first, since he had done all the work. Actually, I think
Chuck was afraid of the snake, which was surely crushed.
We rigged a rope and Dennis rappelled and took the left
passage. Chuck followed, going right. Dennis said he could
see Chuck's light from where he was -- and that the entrance
didn't have to be rappelled. I rappelled in, following Chuck's
path.
We followed the passage, admiring the virgin passage and noting
where to find our way out. I was really impressed, being a trainee
and seeing my first virgin cave. Continuing along the passage, we
crawled through some small breakdown and down through some really
loose shale which broke if you even thought of using it as a foot-
hold. This brought us to a room above a drop which appeared to
be 40 to 50 feet deep.
The floor we were on was really bad. A stream ran through the
middle, coming in on the left. From above, we had seen a passage-
way across the area where we were. We climbed over a conglomerate
boulder that broke in our hands as we climbed, then up the wall
to the passage. At its entrance, there was a rock that looked
like a mallard in flight. The passage became the Duck Walk.
Someone short could duck-walk this passage. It ran 75 feet.
We noted soda straws and rimstone pools along the way.
The Duck Walk ended at some breakdown. We were tired. We
wanted to go back to the party. We decided not to push more pass-
age. We sat down and had a gorp break. Going down from the Duck
Walk above the pit was scarey, with so much exposure. The floor
beside the conglomerate rock was small pebbles and loose rock,
which fell through an opening where the water went down in the floor.
Past this, up the shale we went. Back at the entrance, we
were tired, happy, and felling triumphant about our new cave --
Spring Hollow.
