EDITOR'S COLUMN
I want to thank everybody who helped with the Trog this
fall. Pat Louden's work on the Grotto Grapevine was invalu-
able. Laura Alderson shared the typing load and offered
editorial advice, Joe Zokaites handled the exchange sub-
scriptions this year. The cover drawing is by Boo. Special
thanks to Ed Devine for posing for the photo.
Several people have mentioned to me that they are
working on articles for the next issue. I am looking forward
to seeing them. With all the Grotto's activity, I hope to
see more articles submitted. Considering the range of inter-
ests encompassed by caving, and the diversity of people,
a great variety of material should be available. Anything
that reflects an interest in caving or the club is suitable.
Trip reports, letters to the editor, flag-waving, edit-
orials, fantasy, fiction, cartoons, essays, technical articles
and speleological articles are needed for the next issue.
Inything from a one-paragraph synopsis of a project or
caving trip to a complete article is acceptable. I would
also like to mention that there are many openings available
on the Troglodyte staff.
