include sulfur oxidizing and reducing bacteria, nitrifying bacteria,
and iron oxidizing bacteria.
The most frequently found sulfur oxidizing bacteria of cave waters.
include species of Thiobacillus such as T. thiooxidans and T. Cerrooxidans
(Ford and Cullingford, 1976). T. thiooxidans can use sulfur in any
incompletely oxidized fom, and this energy source is frequently found
in cave waters. With elemental sulfur, it derives energy via equation
1 below:
Equations
(Ford and Cullingford, 1976)
1. 25 + 302 + 24,0 --------- 24,504
2. 2NH4 + 30, --Nature
(Nitrosification)
3. HNO, + 30, Nitrobacter, HNO, + energy
Nitrogononas or Nitrosococcus
-> 2HNO, + 2H,0 + energy
(Nitrification)
Another species of Thiobacteria found in cave waters in Beggiatoa, which
frequently oxidizes the hydrogen gulfide present (Vandel, 1965).
Sulfur reducing bacteria are predominantly anaerobes, and one species
commonly found is Desulfovibrio desulficurans (Ford and Cullingford, 1976).
This organism obtains its growth energy from a mixture of sources, and
similarly to Thiobacillus, is a facultative autotroph.
The process of nitrification by aquatic cave microorganisms is two-step:
the first step is the conversion of ammonia to nitrite and the second step
is the conversion of nitrite to nitrate. These conversions, along with
the organisms typically associated with them are shown in equations 2 and
3 above, respectively.
