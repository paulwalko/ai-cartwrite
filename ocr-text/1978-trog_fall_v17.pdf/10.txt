NOONDAY MOON
THE ULTIMATE IN MODERN CAVING LAMPS
In a dramatic breakthrough, NOON DAY MOON eliminates the
moody carbide and suddenly-dead batteries that huve plagued oavers for
years. Now YOU can make use of the same dependable A-C power that has
been the choice of homeowners and businessmen for years. With the entire
North American power grid at your disposal you will never again have
to leave a cave because of failing lights.
Order the NOONDAY MOON the way YOU want it. Choose either
110 or 220 volt operation, high or low power lighting elements,
standard two wire or heavy-duty grounded three wire power supply for wet
caves. If you send us your needs, we can build you a custom NOON DAY
MOON to meet your special needs (write for special price quote). If

to modern A-C power.
