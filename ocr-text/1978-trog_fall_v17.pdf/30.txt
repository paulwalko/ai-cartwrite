microorganisms are found in virtually every source of cave water, and the
problems of lack of light for photosynthesis and comparatively limited
organic nutrient input are apparently overcome. Contamination with pol-
lutants from outside sources occurs regularly in some cave waters, while
others are subject only to input from intermittent drip sources.
The
microbiology of cave waters is a dynamic study area, and the sometimes
delicate ecosystems involved offer unique opportunity to understand in situ
species interrelationships.
Research in the area of cave water microbiology, not unlike other areas
of research, is plagued by its own special problems. Remoteness, difficulty
reaching some sampling areas, and limitations of cave terrain to most inves-
tigators have caused most research to be conducted in more accessible cave
areas. With this in mind, what is accessible to the average investigator
is also accessible to other cave visitors, certain out-of-the-way, difficult
to reach places may be excellent sites for the isolation of microbial species
found in caves only, but the sites typically investigated may be subject
to human influences not found in more remote cave areas. Work in areas of
caves where the casual cave visitor is unlikely to go must be conducted in
order to more accurately evaluate the uniqueness of cave waters as a
microbial habitat.
