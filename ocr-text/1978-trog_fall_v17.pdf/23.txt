metabolism, and some Streptomyces have been identified as antibiotic pro-
ducers. Some of these heterotrophs may also function as facultative auto-
trophs (Alexander, 1977), E. coli can be isolated from pools with an
increased organic pollution input, and often this input is attributable
to the presence of man (Mason-Williams and Benson-Evans, 1966).
The presence of heterotrophic algae in cave waters is well documented,
but most algae isolated from total darkness zones of caves lack chlorophyll.
A study involving the placement of normally pigmented species from the
Chrysophycophyta, the Chlorophycophyta, and the Cyanophycophyta into caves
and cave-like conditions showed that some species could make the switch from
photolithotrophy to heterotrophy and use the available carbohydrates as their
energy source (Kol, 1966). In addition, when inorganic media was used
(simulating a drip pool or formation surface) some species could still de-
velop and produce chlorophylls. The algae which grew best in the totally
dark cave environment were: Lyngbya lagerheimii, Monodus subterranea,
Phormidium foveolarum, Chlamydomonas, and Chlorella (Kol, 1966).
Fungi are particularly abundant in caves, and are also present in
cave waters.
Their distribution ranges from sparse to dense, and at times
fungal hyphae may be visible in streams. The most commonly isolated species
are the Phycomycetes Achlya and Saprolegnia (Ford and Cullingford, 1976).
Autotrophic microorganisms
Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the microbiology of cave waters
is the presence of autotrophic microorganisms. Most cave waters, with the
exception of fast flowing streamg, have a higher mineral content than do
surface waters. It seems logical that there should be microbes which can
utilize this energy source. Organisms typically found and reported on
