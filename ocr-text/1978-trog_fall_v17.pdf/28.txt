difference is that in the cave ecosystem (aquatic or soil), the input of
vitamins may be restricted to those produced by microbes. :
Odors
The musty smell of caves is caused by the presence of actinomycetes
in soil and water.
THE MICROBIOLOGY OF POLLUTED CAVE WATERS
Much of the current research in cave microbiology deals with polluted
water, mainly because caves are often used as water sources, of particular
interest is the very nature of the cave passage itself, and one study re-
ported:
Pollution is particularly serious in limestone areas
because of underground connections between caves. Even
slight contamination is a serious health hazard and a
threat to all the cave dwellers. It may not kill all
the troglobites, but it could easily upset the cave com-
minity's delicate balance (Poulson and Moore, 1966, p. 191).
Often, a cave may appear to be an excellent site for sewage disposal,
and this is what happened in one Kentucky cave system in the post World War
II years:
They piped raw sewage and industrial wastes into rock
crevices that led into the underground stream. By 1946
the cave had such a stench that it could not be visited
(Poulson and Moore, 1966, p. 191).
The cave mentioned had formerly been a very popular tourist cave,
Pollution can enter a cave through any of several inlets. The most
common ways for organic pollutants to enter a cave'a water system are
through direct seepage, flooding, or dumping in"sinking" creeks or rivers.
Other, less significant ways are through air currents and by cave visitors
(excluding fecal input).
