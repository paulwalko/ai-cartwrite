The Opening of
Spring Hollow by
Pam Wolf
Friday, Oct. 31, 1976, at the VPI Cave Club meeting, Chuck
Shorten asked who'd be interested in digging out what he thought
was a cave over in Bland County. Dennis Vaders and I, a trainee,
decided we were going to go into this cave if it were the last
thing we did. Besides, I wanted to go caving, Chuck needed a
car, and Dennis was dumb enough to go along to drive.
The morning began at 8 a.m., when we were to meet Chuck
in Owens for breakfast. After a slight delay -- to get my ID
card from Dennis's room -- we ate a nice breakfast (at the dining
hall?) and went to gather gear.
Gathering gear took about an hour and a half. When we left
Blacksburg, we had enough sling for an army, plus shovels and
anything else we could think of. Next, we went to sign out at
the Loud's. Finally, after neatly weaving miles of sling, we
were on our way.
We stopped at Don Anderson's in Dublin to get more sling.
Don told us how sick he had gotten the night before. He told
us he had a pick we could use. On to the cave! We drove toward
Buddy Penley's, stopping for bread, bologna and a can of Hawaiian
Punch.
We pulled up at a big white house in front of the power line
cut near where Chuck had found the hole last spring. We were met
at the door by Mrs. Banes. Would she mind if we looked for a cave
on the property? She said we must want Buddy Penley down the
road. Chuck explained he'd found the hole while walking down the
cut last spring. Mrs. Fanes talked to her husband, who seemed
unsure about these young speleologists, but who gave permission.
Off we went, through the field, carefully avoiding cattle
with big horns and cow pies. We located the big rock near the hole.
We spent 15 or 20 minutes throwing rocks down it. Then we began
to dig.
Finally, we cleared enough rocks to get in, or so we thought,
Tile hurried back to the car for gear and to the Baneses for permission
to enter the cave. When we told her the location, she said they
called the area Spring Hollow. We got permission to drive to the
entrance,
We were ready to go caving. Chuck tried to rig a cam rig
while Dennis tied off to a tree. The entrance appeared to be a
30-feet drop and Chuck wanted to go first. Down he went, until
he got to a narrow part and tried to squeeze through. "I'm stuck!"
he yelled.
Dennis and I pulled him up (he was only three feet down) and
we decided Dennis should try since he was smallest. Put the opening
was too small. We had to dig.
With prodding and digging, a large rock on the right dislodged.
Hope arose. Chuck threw out a large rock and yelled, "Snake!"
