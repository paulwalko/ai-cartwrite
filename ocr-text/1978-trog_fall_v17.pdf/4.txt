PRESIDENT'S COLUMN
Last Spring when I was elected to this glorious office,
I decided it was about time to do something about the low
membership this Grotto is suffering from. In the four years
previous that I had been associated with the Grotto, I had
seen only 19 regular and associate members voted in. "Iow,
many of these people are no longer living intthe area or
active caving.
With 20,000 students enrolled here it seemed obvious
that we had been doing something wrong not to have a much
larger group. Of course, the Crotto has always been very
active with a lot of hard core caving, especially mapping,
going on. However, as a student grtto, it is crucial to
get a steady supply of new members to take over for people
as they graduate or otherwise leave.
Together with Vice-president Chuck Shorten I decided
to establish a goal of voting in at least ten new members
during the 78-79 school year, and reducing or eleminating
the feeling of apathy which seemed to be entering grotto
affairs,
Those of you unfamiliar with the VPI Grotto or who have
simply forgotten may find it incredible that a club could
exist with so few members; therefore, let me explain. Iny-
where from 40 to 75 people will show up at our weekly meetings.
However, in order to become a member a person must complete
a comprehensive membership program aimed at assuring a
certain amount of practical caving knowledge. This program requires
a little time to complete but is actually easy for anyone
willing to go on a few caving trips. Unfortionatly, in the
past too few people have passed or been actively encouraged
to pass these membership requirements and get voted into the
Grotto, and the grotto membership has declined as a result,
Now that one school quarter is up it appears that our
membership goal of ten new members this year should easily
be exceeded sometime during Winter quarter. Five have been
voted in Fall quarter. This exceens the yearly average for
the past four years. It is especiallv important that membership
be high this year, because three of us who are club officers
as well as several other of the club's more active members
are supposed to graduate and presumably leave at the end of
this year. Things are looking great so far but only time will
tell for sure.
Well, enough for patting ourselves on the back. Last June
several of us came up with a neat idea that the Grotto
should definately consider and discuss. How about a Grotto
fieldhouse somewhre in Giles or Bland county? Now that the
club is wealthy from winning all those Miller Brewing Company
contest we could probably afford to rent an old, possibly run
