Halloween party (two weeks later) was a great
success. The Main Street house was the perfect place and
there were several outstanding costumes. Eccentric String-
fellow decided against his usual lady-of-the-night attire
and came instead as a computer card. He was promptly
folded, spindled and mutilated. Jan Roode arrived as a
bionic chicken and Danny Wright was a Cylon warrior.
The weekend after Halloween, Danny Wright had his
first annual over-the-hill party. Yes, ladies and gents,
the over-the-hill gang drank again and again and again.
If you don't believe it, ask Ned Coleman!
The club had several weddings: Jock and Carol tied
the knot with a cigar band instead of a ring; Phil Sica
married his true love, Karen; and Buckwheat made an honest
woman out of Nancy Nancy had him in ball and chain im-
mediately following the ceremony. Mike Richardson displayed
exceptional skill and willingness by retrieving both garters
at Buckwheat's and Jock's weddings.
