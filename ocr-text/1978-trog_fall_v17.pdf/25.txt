of water from several caves in South Wales is described as "occasional"
for Nitrosomonas and Nitrosococcus and "frequent" for Nitrobacter (Mason-
Williams, 1966). None of these pools are fed by water from the main streams
in the caves.
Denitrification also occurs to a limited extent in cave waters, but
this is primarily a heterotrophic process (Ford and Cullingford, 1976).
Other autotrophic bacteria present in the nitrogen cycle of cave waters
are the nitrogen-fixing bacteria, Azotobacter spp. and Clostridium spp.
(Mason-Williams and Benson-Evans, 1966), but these occur on a much smaller
scale.
The iron-oxidizing bacteria are often found in areas of the cave with
little or no organic material input; these bacteria are poor competitors
with other heterotrophic microbes.
Substances which appear to be toxic to
them include nitrate and ammonium ions and sulfides, which excludes their
presence from pools filled by drip sources containing hydrogen sulfide
(Caumartin, 1963). Typical species found in cave waters and sediments in-
clude members from the genera Siderococcus and Sideronema.
IMPORTANCE OF CAVE WATER MICROORGANISMS
The most important contributions of the microflora of cave waters
are the roles they play in the food chain and their relationships to other
cave dwelling organisms. The decompositional as well as productive aspects
are considered here, and the cave offers a rather simple yet natural setting
in which to study these interrelationships,
Decompositional role
The decompositional role of cave water microorganisms 18 two-fold
(Moore and Nicholas, 1964). Primarily, the hererotrophic microbes act as
scavengers and break down the waste materials left by other cave dwellers.
