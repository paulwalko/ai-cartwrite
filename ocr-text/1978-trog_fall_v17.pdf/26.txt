Secondly, they release these broken-down materials which in tum serve
as nutrients for other organisms. In this manner, these microbes prevent
the accumulation of organic debris and serve a productive role as well.

almost parallel to that of the heterotrophic bacteria, for they turn
relatively unusable inorganic minerals into usable forms. Their biomass,
in turn, can be a valid carbon source for other organisms in the food chain.
The food chains illustrated in figure 1 below represent two microecosystems
