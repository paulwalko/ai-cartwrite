Donny Carter, Jim Denton, Ed Loud, Alan Armstrong, Doug Perkins

Bill Stringfellow, Mark Powers and Jerry Redder went

Vertical session was at Maybrook Sinkhole this fall,
with a good turnout of prospective members. Special thanks

It looks as if the club will exceed its goal of 10

five new members : Bill Stephens (204); Wynn Wright (205);
Eric Harper (206); John Dec (207); and Dave Shantz (208).
Welcome!
