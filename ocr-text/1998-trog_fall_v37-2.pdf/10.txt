the bridge of your nose. Adjust the cow's tail until these
lengths are correct Load the cow's tail so that all of the
knots tighten and make sure the lengths are again cor-
rect. Cut off the excess rope. The cow's tail should look
like Figure 3.
The Top Ascender
You will need to purchase a top ascender. There are
many different types of top ascenders out there, such as
Petzl Basics, Petzl Ascensions, Jumars, and many oth-
ers. All are acceptable. You should purchase one ac-
cording to which you find most comfortable and easy to
use.
The Foot Loop
The foot loop is attached to your top ascender via a
quick link. Although you bear your weight on the foot
loop, it is not a lifesaving device so you can use a smaller
diameter rope to make it and save some space. The foot
loop probably take the most adjusting. There are three
basic types of foot loops; the single foot loop, the dou-
ble foot loop and the double sling foot loop.
The Double Sling Foot Loop (c)
Note: This foot loop will require approximately twice as
much cord as the other foot loops and may take longer
to adjust.
Tie a figure eight on a bight in the end of the cord large
enough to fit your foot. A few feet down, tie a smaller
figure eight on a bight. This figure eight will attach to
your top ascender. Tie a third figure eight on a bight far-
ther down leaving the same distance between this knot
and the second knot as between the first and second
knot. Make the last knot large enough to fit your foot
through. This is the loop for your other foot.
Before you cut any excess rope off your foot loop, keep
in mind that you will probably have to adjust the system
after climbing for the first time. Leave enough extra to
adjust the loop, but not so much as to interfere with
climbing
Assembling The System
Put on your seat harness and chest harness. The mallion
rapide half round should be attached to the front center
of your seat. If you have a Petzl Super Avanti or a Petzl
Fractio, the mallion rapide half-round will be closing the
seat. Put the bottom of the chest ascender through the
mallion rapide. Clip the top of the chest ascender to the
quick link on the chest harness. Put the cow's tail on the
mallion rapide and clip a carabiner to each of the tails.
Clip the carabiner on the longer cow's tail to the quick
link in the top ascender. Also clip the foot loop into the
quick link on the top ascender. You can clip the shorter
cow's tail to your seat to keep it out of the way. You are
now ready to climb.
Step Four: Fine Tuning
To make sure your system works correctly, try climbing
rope out of a cave, preferably at a rope-running session.
This will let you work out the bugs and work on tuning
the lengths. The carabiners on the long cow's tail should
reach over the bridge of your nose and the top of the
carabiner on the shorter cow's tail should touch your
chin. When standing up straight in the foot loop, the
cam of the top ascender should be high enough so that
it doesn't hit the cam of the chest ascender. Your chest
harness should be tight and cause you to hunch over
when tightened properly.
Tips On Climbing
As with any system, there is an efficient way to climb
and an inefficient way to climb with a Frog. Here are
some tips to maximize efficiency:
â€¢ Try to keep your body as vertical as possible. This
will keep you from wasting energy to keep writing
yourself every step.
Do not raise your top ascender higher than eye
level when climbing or you may really tire out your

Figure 4: Three Types of Foot Loop
The Single Foot Loop (a)
Tie a figure eight on a bight in the end of the 6 mm cord.
A few feet down, tie another figure eight on a bight
Leave a loop large enough to put both of your feet
through while wearing your cave boots. The top figure
eight should be attached to the top ascender via a large
oval screw link. When both feet are in the foot loop and
the ascender is raised vertically, the cam of the top as-
cender should be just above the cam of the chest as-
cender. Adjust the foot loop until this length is correct
The Double Foot Loop (b)
Tie a figure eight on a bight in the end of the cord as
above. Tie a double figure eight (life knot) or a bowline
on a bight a few feet down. There should now be two
loops in the end of the foot loop. Make sure these loops
are large enough so you can fit one booted foot in each
loop. Adjust the length of the foot loop as descabed
above.
