As I said before, this is just one way to build a frog. If
you are interested in knowing more, ask some Old Farts
or members with Frog systems for some ideas and rec-
ommendations before starting. Happy Caving!
Attach your pack to your harness by a cord. The
pack on your back can make it difficult and
tiresome to climb. If you have extra cord left over
from making your foot loop, you may want to use
it for this purpose. Make sure when the pack is
hanging from your harness that it is hanging below
your feet. It can be very annoying to climb with
the pack banging against the back of your legs or
your feet.
Always inspect all gear before climbing. Make sure
all quick links and mallion rapides are tightened
correctly and situated where the rope will not open
the gates if it runs against them.
