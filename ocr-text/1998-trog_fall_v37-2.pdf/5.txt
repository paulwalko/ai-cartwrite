wavering on and off of the stone ledge. I poked my
head up. "Nope, doesn't go anywhere, I'm coming
down." I headed down the ladder and was relived to
feel solid ground beneath my feet. LePera climbed the
ladder after me and then we began to pack up the
equipment.
Heading out we went through a slimy crawl which
somehow had seemed only half so bad on the way in.
I pushed and struggled, but somehow the cable ladder
and my pack seemed cemented in the mud. Eventual-
ly I wiggled through, but not without discovering that
neither yelling at the pack nor explaining why it
should move would cause the pack to budge.
Everything seemed more difficult on the way out. I
was cold and tired. Rather then carefully negotiate the
waterfall climb, I chose to climb straight up it. Rather
then avoid the stream, I sloshed on through. The
words "I'm never going caving again, I'm never go-
ing caving again. I hate caving." echoed through my
head.
"You and Danny doing ok?" asked Steve.
Two nods and cheerful smiles were his reply.
I wondered if Danny was having the same thoughts I
was.
Finally we reached the dreaded self belay climb out.
I'd been to Stay High once before and remembered
how hard it had been, hanging on with one hand while
trying to push my helical up the rope with the other. I
was going to stay in the cave tonight; good thing I had
my granola bars. Luckily, this time I had brought an
ascender with me. To my surprise, the ascender made
the climb out a breeze. Suddenly I was out of the cave.
Suddenly caving didn't seem so bad after all.
We headed back to the cars. Joe handed out Fosters,
and much to my surprise everyone started socializing
(why do people DO that?). I guzzled my beer, hoping
that everyone would get the hint. Instead I just got sort
of dizzy and stopped minding the fact that it was tak-
ing a while to leave. We finally headed back to town
and signout. I headed home and tumbled into bed with
the satisfied feeling that I had survived my most diffi-
cult cave trip yet.
