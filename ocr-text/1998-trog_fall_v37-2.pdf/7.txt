we've spent approximately two or so hours in the mud.
After cramming all three of us into a tight little area for
about 20 more minutes, the majority of those with Matt
on my legs, we determined that it would be wise to turn
around; we were getting cold. Besides, we meant to sur-
vey 100 feet, and we got eleven done. Well, that's 11%.
And that's good. That's 11% more than would have
been surveyed had we not gone.
Forget about the fact that we quickly realized that the
place we stopped surveying was where we were sup-
posed to start. That's not important Just focus on the
eleven feet we did get done. For the sake of everyone
else in the club though, we decided not to tell them how
muchwehadsurveyed;wedidn'twanttoseempretentious.
So we headed back out. Very quickly. And that's about
it.
I'm excited about the opportunities to go back. I really
expect that we'll find something interesting back there.
I'm thinking booming virgin passage and 90-foot pits
and large waterfalls. Yeah, Tawney's definitely has a lot
to offer.
Hmm... I just reread Steve LePera's trip report in the
Trainee Trog and he mentioned beverages. I didn't get
any beverages...
