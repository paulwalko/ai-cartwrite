Jesses'
by Steve Kark, VPI #92, first published in '68
A caver is a dirty bum,
he runs in caves all day.
For skin he has hardened scum,
and his heart is made of clay!
- S. Kark
After awhile the passage appeared to get a bit bigger and
by now the waterfall was a roar. Beyond, the passage
(about three feet high) had a swift current of water run-
ning through it. Here we decided to go back. We never
made it to the falls but shall try damn hard the next time.
The big rooms (I prefer to call them the Minotaur
rooms) had quite a few leads heading off in all direc-
tions, some with a draft. We all agreed that we'd come
back again some day soon. (Didja ever get back there,
Steve? -Ed.]
After we had reached the entrance room and changed,
we packed into Ed's car. We were all very tired and the
only thing that kept us awake was the fact that Ed kept
drifting into the left lane. He was so tired!
Although it was hard, I did fall asleep. When I awoke
for an instant we weren't moving and all I could hear
was a stream. I went back to sleep. (Ed had stopped to
get a few hours rest). The next time I awoke we were
very near Blacksburg. It took me a few days to get back
my natural surly energy and soon I was negative as ever!
I wish to dedicate this trip report to all those fools who
unlike us, are too smart to go caving. They have never
felt the cool mud oozing down their chests, nor tasted
the seven-year guano. They think a crawl is a baby walk
and a lead a good singer! They have never climbed a wa-
terfall, nor been bitten by a rabid bat; instead they walk
around above, always knowing where they're at. To
them I say, "May the bat of paradise drop a flea on your
hair cream!” And to those of you who have tasted the
sweet nectar of caving, “Go to hell” For the rest, “Bon
Appetit!
Besides my trip to Banes' where I was attacked by a
lusty cricket, I suppose my most interesting trip was to
Tesses' Cave. Ed Morgan tied us up and loaded us into
his car and with shouts of delight he whisked us off to
Jesses'.
At the cave entrance he untied us and Dave McCloy bit
him in the leg. After we assured him Dave wasn't rabid,
we loaded ourselves with gear and entered the cave. We
changed in the entrance room, despite Bob Lewis' weird
behavior. Then we pushed through the cave and began
mapping where we last left off. I got out of most of the
work by running around flashing my camera at the oth-
ers. Ed Morgan posed for a few shots but I hardly think
they'll make “Sports Illustrated.”
After some “fun” climbing we came to a deep fissure
that Ed had explored before. We chimneyed down,
mapping all the way. At the bottom a stream passage
pushed into the darkness. We followed the stream until
we found a section of quite large rooms.
From here on the cave was all running, and to our great
amusement it all appeared virgin. While the rest kept
mapping, Dave McCloy and I walked through the big
rooms completely thrilled. At what appeared to be the
last big room were three leads. One was behind a huge
formation; this we checked. Directly behind the forma-
tion were the most intricate rimstone dams both of us
had ever seen. The crawl got a bit tight in places and
even filled with water at others but from beyond we
could hear a huge rumbling of a waterfall that pulled us
on.
