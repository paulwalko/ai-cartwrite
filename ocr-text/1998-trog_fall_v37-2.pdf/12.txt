Grotto Grapevine

ipation. This included rope running, surveying, trivia,
and beer guzzling. Club members took home several
first, second, and third place awards. Quite a feat for a
grotto which many OTR regulars didn't think would at-
tend this year.
During the awards ceremony, the OTR chair had a
slight oversight and omitted naming the grotto as each
winner was called to the stage. Kirk Digby kept matters
in line by calling out "Which grotto?” and sometimes
“More wood!” whenever a VPI caver was announced.
Rance Edwards got elected to accept all of the VPI priz-
es.
CONVENTION AND FIELD CAMP
Once again Sandy Knapp got the club involved in a
huge project. This summer it was the pre-convention
Field Camp held at the Bat Ranch. Around fifteen peo-
ple from other states spent the weekend caving and re-
laxing before heading to TAG. All of the visitors were
pleased with the set-up which included a shower stall in
the back yard. Sandy did a great job of organizing.
A few VPI cavers who went to Convention went pit
bouncing with one of the guests, another guest has
since contacted VPI just to say hello.
Only a handful of club members made the TAG con-
vention this year, but VPI managed to come home with
some rope-running prizes. Steve LePera, Jim Washing-
ton, Eileen O'Malley, and Ray Sira participated in the
medley, landing a second-place finish. Okay, so there
were only two grottos racing.) Steve placed in the top
four for men's 400-meter mechanical, and Eileen won
first place in the women's 100-meter sit-stand. (While
Steve had actual competition, Eileen was a lone partici-
pant)
OTR
This year was the first year of the Sivtac Reunion (also
known as ATR (alternative), No-TR, and OTR-lite), à
splinter group of former OTR attendees. The gathering
was held close enough to the Dailey site to allow visitors
to pass between the groups. Highlights of the weekend
were Spotty Dog Rapier's rambunctious four-wheeling
(they say his cruiser got louder and slower each time up
the hill) and the fire on the river. As tradition deems, the
More Wine Party took place on Sunday afternoon lead-
ing to more than a few tipsy campers.
Suzie Warren and Ko Takimizawa road their bicycles to
the Sivtac Reunion from Blacksburg. It took them two
days and two sore butts, but they made it.
Jerry Redder camped at Sivtac and biked to the OTR
site for a visit He was excited when he noted a posted
list of Known Troublemakers, but disappointed when
he couldn't find his name on it Jerry and many Elvis
Grotto members bicycled to OTR but left just a few
hours later. Philip Balister biked over, too, but despite
much effort the cavers at OTR couldn't get him to leave
with the others.
VPI launched a i

tests and tied for second place in Overall Grotto Partic-

After much deliberation, Chris Rourke decided to post-
pone bis college career and head back to Northern Vir-
ginia because he dearly missed his parents. He said, "I
just couldn't stand the thought of Mom washing all
those dishes without help.” :
Thus decided, he sadly relinquished his position as Vice
President. Guido (Chris) Garguilo quickly abandoned
his post as Secretary and was voted in as Vice Prez. Al-
lison Barth stepped in as Secretary. Jessica Dorr remains
President and the Treasurer goes without saying.
There was quite a
boon of new mem-
bers as Rourke tried
to shovel as many
trainees as possible
through the trainee
program before his
departure from
town. The Yeagle
