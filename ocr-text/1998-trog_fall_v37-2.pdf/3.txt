A Carbide Lamp Tip
by Walt Pirie
Ever find your burner tip so clogged that even the tip
cleaner won't penetrate it? There's a product I've found
that solves the problem so it's not necessary to buy a
new tip. It's called Lime-a-Way and is available at the su-
permarket. It usually works with a one-hour soaking, al
though one stubborn tip took overnight.
That's right it won't help you in a cave, but you aren't
likely to need it there if you remember to check your
lamp before leaving for the trip. This usually only hap-
pens when your lamp sits for a week (or weeks) between
trips and totally dries out The gunk can really harden
then.
And while you're at it, if you use your lamp bottom to
soak it in, it'll also do a good job of clearing out that
hardened carbide sludge in the bottom.
