Tawney's Survey!!!
by Matt Stec
I awoke early one Saturday morning in September, still
buzzing from the previous nights Speleo-seminar, only
to realize that today was the day. The day I'd been wait-
ing for since I'd started caving. I had finally broken into
the group of real cavers: the surveyors. Oh yeah. And
where was I'to go on my first trip? To the nether regions
of Tawney's, the legendary cave of Giles County.
The cave has been traversed many times, but few people
have experienced the cave in all its glory, and the former
surveyors ignored a lead thinking that it didn't go.
Cavers later learned that this was not the case, and the
Seashore was discovered but never mapped. Thus, the
first assignment of the newly formed Giles County Cave
Survey team was to finish the process. We were to map
this most wonderful area of the cave
I was excited to be surveying, but caving is always en-
joyable with wonderful friends. On this beautiful day I
was to head underground with Joel Bergstein, the train-
ee who first convinced me to begin caving, and Matt
Burnett, a member and highly skilled surveyor. Matt had
actually done a large amount of surveying in another,
more obscure cave, Starnes. A three-man survey team is
apparently the most efficient group, allowing one per-
son to handle a lead tape (measuring distance between
survey points), one to take measurements, and one to
sketch the passage and record data. Our trip was com-
plete.
I met Matt at the Owen's Food Court at around 10:00
a.m. or so, and we headed over to Smythe to meet up
with some new trainees and Joel. While at Smythe, Matt
began an in-depth discussion on the use of the Brunton,
a surveying instrument that measures both azimuth and
inclination/declination through the use of a compass-
type gauge. While this instrument takes some getting
used to, Matt was such a wonderful instructor; Joel and
I learned to make near perfect measurements in only a
few minutes.
However, though we were both very competent, only
one of us could take on the awesome responsibility that
comes with the Brunton. It was decided that we would
have a small, but fierce, competition to see whose mea-
surements came closest to Matt's. I think the test would
have been much more effective had Matt not picked a
magnetic post to use as a survey point (which threw the
measurements off by at least 90 degrees), but my num-
bers were closer, so I was given the Brunton for the re-
mainder of the trip. It was an honor I did not take
lightly.
We finally got to head out to the cave, after a quick stop
at Signout and Wades, of course. We were motivated to
get underground as soon as possible because we had ap-
proximately one hundred or so feet to survey, and we
expected it to take some time. So we got ready, ate
lunch, and went into the cave. I won't detail the things
to see in Tawney's, as words can't do them justice; one
truly must experience the cave to appreciate its beauty.
We sped to the back of the cave where the survey was
to take place. I was having trouble with my light,
though, so I was a little slower. I finally got to the back
after fixing my lamp, and we went through a small can-
yon-type section that led to a pinch. We got through it,
though it involved a weird bend up and was not the
most comfortable of experiences. Luckily, I dropped
the trowel I had in my pack down a nasty little drop, so
we got to wait around while that was retrieved.
I won't bore you with the dialogue that my minor acci-
dent brought about Let's just say that our trip leader
wasn't too happy. But we all knew that beyond this in-
convenience was the Promised Land of Tawney's. We
forged ahead.
For those of you who don't know the passage right be-
fore the Seashore, it is a beautiful place to spend hours
and hours. The way you can sit in knee-deep, sticky
small clay mud is wonderful. The experience of having
your boot sucked off your feet by some gurgling beast
underneath is not one to miss. This is where we were to
begin surveying. How exciting.
Joel jumped to attention, not complaining a bit. Good
ol' Joel, you can always count on him to be chipper. He
scouted out two good survey points in just under 20
minutes, I believe. I think we measured a total of six feet
between the two and then it was my turn with the mea-
surements. Meanwhile, Matt went off to a comer of the
small room we were in and sat. He was very trusting in
my ability to call out the proper numbers.
It's very different measuring in a dark cave than it is out-
side. Angles have to be proper to use the mirror and lev-
els have to be right, and all this has to be done while
keeping your light source out of the way, but still pro-
viding light to read. It was rough, definitely a challenge,
but I rose to the occasion and, after many harsh words
were thrown to and from every member of our survey
team, I took those measurements. Joel then picked an-
other point
We thought he was getting really good at it, having al-
ready picked two others. After probably 30-plus min-
utes trying to get measurements at this new point, Matt
realized that the point went around a comer, thereby
making the mirror on the Brunton ineffective. A few
more words were exchanged. Communication is good.
We found another point and determined that Matt was
in a better position to take the measurements. So we let
him. Little did we know Matt would actually tear down
half the wall in the room in order to get a 4-foot shot,
but cave alteration is sometimes necessary to really see
everything. Besides, he's a member; he knows what he's
doing. After more words were exchanged regarding the
condition of the Brunton, we got the shot. At this point
