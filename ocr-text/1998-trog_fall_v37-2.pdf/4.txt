The Stay High Pole Trip Adventure
by Amanda Stiles
It all started out with a phone call. I could hear Chris
talking on the phone, “No way am I going; there is ab-
solutely NO WAY. Well, you could ask Amanda but
she never caves." So I got the phone. “Hey, do you
want to go on a pole trip to Stay High tomorrow?”
asks Steve Wells. A pole trip, what's that?
A pole trip involves carrying five foot metal sections
of a gigantic pole through the cave so you get even
more tired than usual. “You carry these metal pieces
through the cave and set them up so you can check out
a really cool high lead in the cave,” Steve says glibly.
"What time would we be back? Three in the after-
noon? That's not bad”. I hear a snort from Chris.
“What, he said 3:00! Ok, sure I'll go, see y'all tomor-
row!”
How exciting, checking out a lead that no one has
been to before. Virgin passage, it could go anywhere,
a new 10 miles of cave, a brand new entrance, a newly
discovered species of bat... fame and fortune at my
fingertips. Well, maybe not, but it would still be inter-
esting.
I showed up the next morning at Signout and surveyed
my companions and the equipment we were taking
with us. Steve and Steve, Joe Thompson, Danny Zo
and I. Perfect. Five people for five sections of pole.
The equipment pile was impressive: ropes, a cable
ladder, rock hammer, survey tape, bolt kit, lots of
webbing and carabiners, and of course the five sec-
tions of pole. We divied up the equipment, got into
cars, and headed for the cave.
It wasn't long before we arrived at the cave. We all
got changed into our cave clothes and boots and fired
up our carbide lights. Since I had the lightest pack, I
picked up the rock hammer and survey tape and
stuffed them in. I carried the cable ladder and my sec-
tion of pole. Hmm, much more stuff then usual; this
should make caving that much more interesting.
The rappel into Stay High is a little scary because you
need to step over a hole part of the way down. If you
fell in, it wouldn't be so bad, you'd just have some
trouble getting out again. So stepping over this place
(especially with a large metal pole attached to my
side) I got a little nervous. Unfortunately, my lamp
got even more nervous, jumped off my head, and ka 1-
mikazied into the drop. “NO!” I cried, distraught for
my faithful little carbide light. At this point my Petzel
(being offended, I assume) refused to turn on. Hmm,
this was a fairly bad situation. Hadn't I heard some-
thing about “three sources of light”? Maybe situations
like these were reasons why. “LePera,” I called meek-
“Alright, stay on the ledge, I'm coming."
Shortly thereafter a brave carbide lamp rescue was en-
acted and harmony restored. Unfortunately, the Petzel
still refused to turn on until supplied with new batter-
ies. Batteries with a name more like Energizer as op-
posed to Wades special AA's.
The trip passed...and passed...and passed....
Finally we were almost at the place to set up the pole.
Boy was I glad, because I was exhausted. This would
provide some much needed rest. “Ok we're going to
be going over a really pretty rimstone pool. There's
nothing underneath it so you can't fall onto it because
you'll break it.” I could hear Steve [Which one? Nev-
er mind; they're both the same. -Ed.] up ahead ex-
plaining what to do. It was my turn to go across and I
listened to the explanation.
"All you have to do is straddle the pool, then sort of
do a one armed push-up as you bring your legs across
and another one armed push-up to get the rest of you
across.” One armed WHATS?! I felt resigned to the
fact that I would destroy the pretty formation. Fight-
ing this urge, I made the attempt to get across without
crashing through. Thankfully I succeeded. Looking at
it from the other direction, it was very pretty. A long
ledge about an inch thick and filled with water. Un-
derneath was nothing.
Arriving at the lead, you could see a dark hole about
25 feet in the air. We began putting the pole together.
You slide the pieces together and then screw in two
bolts to hold them together. With some effort the pole
was placed up in the air, leaning against the wall with
the top just poking into the virgin passage. Steve
Wells was first to climb the cable ladder to the pas-
sage. I belayed him to such comforting comments as,
“You know, if he falls you're going to be pulled into
the pole. The pole will crumple and Steve, the pole
and ladder will all fall on top of you.” Luckily he got
to the top of the ladder safely and negotiated the scary
lip off of the ladder to go explore the passage.
“It dies after a few feet” he called down and began his
descent. He reached the bottom, belay off, much to
my relief. “Do you want to climb?” he asked me. No,
of course I didn't want to climb up the ladder. If you
just tap the pole, the whole apparatus crumples. I was
afraid of ladders. The passage didn't go anywhere
anyway. Its was cold in there and I wanted to go
home.
"Sure.” I tied in to the belay rope and began the ascent
of the cable ladder. Filled with dread I felt myself
spinning closer and closer to the pole. Inevitably I
would touch it and the precarious setup would come
crashing around my ears. Later I realized it wasn't
nearly as precarious as I thought, but at the time it
seemed quite terrifying. I climbed to the top, the pole
ly.
“What's going on down there? Are you down yet?”
“I carled my lamp.” Did I hear a sigh? I could have
sworn I heard a sigh.
