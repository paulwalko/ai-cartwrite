My Trip to Stralies' Cave
by Andy Yeagle
In the fall of last year, I saw a unique cave and did a bit
of ridge walking and bush whacking with Bill Steier,
Suzie Warren, and Matteus ???
We visited Stralies' cave. Stralies' is somewhere near
Angeľs Rest. It sits in a very nice valley on the Stralies'
farm. The day we went was clear, sunny, and a little
windy; nice for late fall.
When we got there, we talked to Mr. Stralies, the owner,
for a while and then started hiking to the cave. The cave
is farther down the valley. We walked along some pas-
tures and went under a fence where we had been told.
We found the entrance just a short ways up on the side
of the next hill and got ready to cave.
One nice thing about short caves is that you don't need
to carry nearly as much stuff. No food or vertical gear
required. Other than my helmet, lamp, and cave clothes,
I had water, carbide, and a piece of Wrigley's Spearmint.
All in one of those gas mask bags. Bill and Matheus
were going to hike instead. So Suzie and I went caving.
Just inside the entrance is a bit of a drop – maybe four
feet. The passage made a small loop and at the far end
was a pit. I believe Suzie said the pit was about 80 feet
(give or take 80 feet). But crawls are always more fun
any ways. Fortunately the rest of the cave was a dry
crawl way. So we crawled. There were some nice forma-
tions there. Mostly small stalactites and a few soda
straws.
So we made it to the other side of the cave and crawled
out of another exit. It was the tiniest hole I ever hope to
come out of ever again. It required you to remove your
helmet and hand it through. I also remember getting a
face full of dirt.
After exiting the cave, we walked a few hundred yards
back to the other entrance and waited for Bill and
Matheus to return. We were all supposed to meet back
in half an hour. Then we were off ridge walking. We
hiked up a steep mountain with some thick brush in
places. At the top there was a nice view. Hiked along the
ridge and back down, but we didn't find any new caves.
We all had a nice walk back to the vehicles, heading up
the valley, and enjoying the view of a very beautiful
farm. Even if you didn't grow up in the middle of no-
where Pennsylvania, you too would be impressed.
Stralies’ is unique in that it is small, but it has, I believe,
six entrances. Some being suited for nothing larger than
your arm. The entire trip took maybe 30 to 40 minutes.
But small caves can be good fun. I also recommend
Spruce Run, another cool small cave.
