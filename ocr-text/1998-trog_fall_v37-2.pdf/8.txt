The Frog System Revisited
article and drawings by Allison Barth
A little while ago, I decided I wanted a climbing system
that was faster than knots but still affordable, so I set
out to build a Frog system. It seemed easier to use and
quicker on-rope. Little did I know what I was getting in-
to. I asked around to find out what materials I would
need, how the Frog worked and how to assemble it, and
no one could give me a straight forward answer. Paul
Hess published an article on building the Frog system in
the 92-93 Trog, but that can be difficult to find, so for
all of you out there interested in building a Frog system
who want a straightforward plan, here is what I have
discovered.
The Frog system was originally developed for European
caving the philosophy there is that bolts should be
placed at a rub point so the attached rope can hang free-
ly instead of padding the rope at a rub point. The Frog
gave European cavers a mechanical system that enabled
the climber to be efficient and easily and safely pass
bolts, or rebelays,. The Frog has become more popular
in the United States because it is cheaper than a Rope-
walker, but still more efficient than Prussiks. My Frog
system cost around $185.
There are many advantages to the Frog climbing sys-
tem. It is very lightweight and compact for a mechanical
system. This comes in handy when you don't have a lot
of room in your pack (you know, because of all the ice-
cube trays). The Frog is quick and easy to attach to the
rope and ideal for use with rebelays and change-overs.
With practice, the system allows you to down climb eas-
ily. Because the Frog's two attachment points are both
at or above the users center of gravity. It would be near-
ly impossible to be flipped upside down in a "heel-
hang” or upside down should an ascender fail.
The Frog is also good for those of you who are interest-
ed in a mechanical system but may not be proportioned
well enough to use a chest plate with a rope walker com-
fortably. The Frog can be more comfortable and suited
to your shape. And it costs around $150 less than a
ropewalker.
The Frog is not always the most wonderful system for
climbing, though. The motion incurred when climbing
with the Frog system causes a lot of bouncing. This
stresses the rope and rig points more than other systems
and can cause the rope to abrade. Also, the Frog only
has two points of attachment to the rope. It is prefera-
ble to have three points of attachment on-rope for re-
dundancy. If the system is not adjusted properly, it can
quickly tire the upper body. This could make you one
very unhappy caver on a long climb. If climbing drops
greater than 300 feet, a Rope-walker may make life eas-
ier. Of course, this depends on your level of fitness and
machismo: “When I was a trainee, I climbed el So-
tano...hand over hand, and I liked it!”
There are four basic steps when building a Frog system.
The first is determining what you want to do with your
system and how much you can afford to pay for it. This
will help determine what equipment you will need.
Next, you will need to purchase the equipment The
third step is actually building the system. Lastly, you
must refine the system for optimum performance.
What follows is basically a step-by-step analysis of
building a Frog system. Please keep in mind that this is
just one way to build a Frog system. I am by no means
an expert with the Frog, so it is a really good idea to ask
around. See if anyone has anything to add, or can tell
you the pros and cons to building this system as this or
any other way.
Step 1: What Can You Afford?
The Frog system consists of five basic parts: the seat
harness, the chest harness, the foot loop, two ascenders,
and the cow's tail. You can buy all of these parts from
vendors, but that can get pretty expensive and you may
not always have the time to drive several hours to your
favorite vendor to buy a cow's tail and foot loop. Chest
harnesses, cow's tails, and foot loops purchased from a
vendor usually have extras to make them more comfort-
able and easier to use...for a price. But these extras are
not necessary and you can make your own for much less
money.

I recommend buying
one of these since mak-

be difficult and may not
be as safe.
