COMINGS AND GOINGS
Amy Johnson met up with Carl Bern in Idaho just long
enough to take a job in Denver, Colorado. Wiú Carl be
following her?
Allison Dineen is moving to Florida after December,
hoping for a job with Disney World. She leaves an
opening at Steve Wells' House o' Cavers.
Shannon Bircham moved out to the West Coast right
after OTR. Now she's in the same state as her boy-
friend.
Dave Warren's company shipped him to California. Is
it sunny in California caves?
Several people we thought we finally got rid of are mov-
ing back to town. Ko Takimizawa sparked the trend of
going back-to-school last semester and will be followed
by Spotty Dog Rapier and possibly Jake Brown. Suzie
Warren returns to continue her fine Virginia Tech edu-
cation as well.
ELECTRONIC INSULTS
Much bitterness circulated on the club listserv as long-
time buddies Steve LePera and Wil Orndorff called it
quits on their friendship. Said Wil, “I just can't pretend
to like that son-of-a-bitch any longer.” Angry words
were exchanged on the listserv until Philip Balister, Rul-
er of the List, kicked them off.
The duo then scheduled a caving "duel to the death” for
late December to put an end to the dispute. Steve
claimed that only one of us will come out alive.” How-
ever the pitiful pleas of his wife and kids prevailed, and
Wil bowed out from the competition.
HALLOWEEN PARTY
Attendance
was low at
this year's
Halloween
Party, but
those who
showed had
as much fun
as ever. Car-
toons, comic
strips, and
foreign skits
came to life
at the Bat
Ranch. The
Scooby Doo
crew arrived
Steve vs. Steve
with Doug
Bruce as
Fred, Sue Setzler as Daphne, Zenah Ornorff as Velma,
Mike Horne as Shaggy, and of course T.J. Ornorff as
Scooby. Steve & Steve became Spy vs. Spy and tossed
bombs at each other all night. Matt Burnett, Matt Stec,
Andy Yeagle, and Joel Bergstein came as a Monty Py-
thon skit, but most people didn't notice they'd dressed
for the party. (Don't they always look dorky?)

THE HAMS

The num-
ber of am-

operators
in the club
is increas-
ing dra-
matically,
this time
with Philip
Balister as
the major
instigator.
Rumors
suggest
that he's
planning a

it's a great photo.)
make all of
the ques-
tions ham-related. Says Philip, “I can't understand rhy
having your ham license isn't a membership require-
ment by now.”
Actually, his current project with Craig Ferguson and
Ko Takimizawa involves building a system of cave radi-
os. Adding radio-assisted surface locations will improve
the accuracy of future cave surveys.
CHRISTMAS IN MEXICO
Once again VPI cavers shirked family responsibilities
and spent Christmas and New Years in Mexico. The
group totalled one truck and then bounced El Sotano
de Barro just days later. Be sure to catch the next Trog
which will reveal all of the pictures and scandalous tales.
(And ladies, guard your belly button!)
UPCOMING BANQUET
This year's Banquet will be held in the usual place on the
usual Saturday. Special features are the VPI vs. Sirtac
rope running contest and the home brew contest. Dust
off your gear and make your favorite beverage get you
more than just drunk.
