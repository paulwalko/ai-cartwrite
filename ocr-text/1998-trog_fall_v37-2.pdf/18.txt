Connected two passages and got good
and wet on the way out.
Were actually in Hamilton's, and found
Baines waterfall hole, but couldn't find
Baines Spring..
It was a fun trip. Now we are going
home to pick the ticks out of our asses.
The Pres. and Vice Pres. had some trou-
bles, but the trainees helped us through...
oops!

Joel learned two important lessons. 1)
Never throw your pack too far in front
of you in a crawl 2) Where that back-
pack-sized hole goes.
"It will only be a 1/2 hour dig."
