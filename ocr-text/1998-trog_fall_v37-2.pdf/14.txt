On the Lighter Side
by Joel "The Hair” Bergstein
“Ugh!” was the first thought in my mind the morning of
my first survey trip. Matt Burnett, Matt Stec and I were
planning to survey a bit of unmapped passage in Taw-
ney's.
Most people think of Tawney's as a nice trainee cave.
Boy Scout trips often peruse its passageways, et cetera.
Few, however, are aware of the hell which awaits those
who dare venture towards... THE SEASHORE!!
While it is a deceptively short passage, waiting within
are tight awkward pinches, extremely dense mud, an-
noying crawlways, and a good bit of standing water.
Needless to say, I was not looking forward to spending
six to eight hours in this area.
I get up the morning of the trip, after being woken sey-
eral times by Matt Bumett, about fifteen minutes before
I had to meet the rest of the trip at Smythe. Neither the
day nor I was happy. Feeling not quite refreshed from
the few hours sleep ended and having nothing available
for breakfast I headed out the door in a foul mood. It
was cold. Eventually I struggle my way to Smythe only
to find that we must wait there for an hour in case there
were any straggling trainees on their way to the vertical
session being held at the quarry.
This was the time Bumett chose to instruct Stec and
myself on the surveying methods. Here, he not only in-
troduced us to a Brunton for the first time but said that
one of us would have to be instruments. Unfortunately
he wasn't kidding. Stec and I competed and I won. I got
lead tape.
Eventually we made it to the Bat Ranch. With the little
energy I could muster, I donned the garb of a caver:
overalls with the entire rear torn out, a mud caked and
torn polyester sweater, and soggy boots. I lit my lamp
and snagged the tape. We headed into the cave at about
1:00 p.m.
As soon as we entered the cave the troubles began.
Stec's lamp was being quite fickle this day. Approxi-
mately sixty feet from the entrance we had to stop for
that to be worked out
The travel through the tourist section to the beginning
of the seashore was no more exciting than the past sev-
en thousand trips there. When we finally reached the
first pinch on the path to Hell, we were about a half
hour into the cave.
It took us each about twenty minutes to push and twist
ourselves and our packs up a sticky mud slope and
through the pinch. On the other side of the pinch is a
thirty foot dropoff. Of course, something had to fall
down there. Stec took the opportunity to drop the trow-
el at the appropriate time. “Clink, clank, CLUNK!” So
Burnett proceeded to bitch profusely and climb down
to get the trowel.
We then came upon the mud. Please allow me to ex-
plain, as this is no ordinary mud. There are many styles
of mud. There is, for instance, the relatively dry mud of
Links, which will actually remove other mud for your
clothes as you cave. At the other extreme is the Falas
room [Anyone care to tell him what it's named for?
Would that even change his spelling? -Ed.] mud, which
is saturated enough to accommodate standing water.
Then there is the seashore mud. This mud has the con-
sistency of taffy, the density of steel, and the adhesion
of duct tape. It can and will stick to everything. This is
the mud bom of Hell.
We proceed to attempt a first shot The longest straight
shot down the passage is about one and a half feet.
Hoping to reduce the number of shots we take it
through a small side passage, getting a seven foot shot.
Unfortunately, despite many attempts by both Matts,
we are unable to get a straight shot from there into the
main passage. Eventually we move the mud around a
bit, actually just get more mud on ourselves, and are
able to make a five foot shot into the main passage. We
are now about four hours into the trip.
Then we reach the real pinch. We decide that the best
way to take the next shot is for me, lead tape, to go
through the pinch and come back head first to light the
survey point. The pinch itself is not extremely tight, but
it is very awkward and painful. I started into the pinch
at a crawl, then made the ninety degree turn up, then the
ninety degree turn left, then got stuck. I had never
freaked out in a cave, not even the previous two times
through this pinch, but when I tried to back out and
couldn't move, I cracked. Fortunately I eventually twist-
ed and turned enough to get back through and called
the trip.
Needless to say, I was not very happy on the way out.
Then I began having trouble with my lamp. Upon re-
turning to the Bat Ranch and stripping down I was able
to calm myself, but I never, NEVER want to return
there to survey again. I will, but I don't want to.
