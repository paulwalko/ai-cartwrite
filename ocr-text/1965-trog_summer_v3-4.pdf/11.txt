AROUND THE REGION
For the information of new members and readers, the Virginia Region is a
grouof the various Washington area Grottos, Uva, VPI, Richmond and Monogahela
Grottos, WVACS and various independent cavers from both Virginia and West Virfod :*,
ginia. Its purpose. seems to be to decl with problems and information in thë :
West Virginia-Virginia caving area and it meets several times a year for dis- ".
süssions, work trips, conservation efforts and socializing. John Cooper serves
as chairman; Betty Lloyd is secretary,
. At present, the various grottoes are coordinating their efforts on several
of the large horizontal systems in Greenbrier County, West Virginia; they are
working 'to establish better landowner relations with the owners of several closed.
caves; they are working on possible anti-cave vandal legislation in both Vir-
ginia and West Virginia; they are working on a Cave Rescue Communication Network
for this area and, of course, continue as individuals and grottoes to add to
the Virginia Cave Survey.
... Through strong individual and grctto participation in the Region, many of
the increasing conservation problems of this area can be attacked and better.;
dissemination of information and coordination of surveys may be effected.
'. The last few months have seen several regional conclaves. The first week-
end in May found close to 50 members of the Region in the Greenbrier County,
West Va., area for the annual regional project. This year we met at the Green-
brier. Hotel in Ronceverte and there split into groups to explore Fullers, Cul-
verson Creek, and McClungs. Caves: Three survey parties working on the . WVACS:
survey in McClungs and Lipton's mapped several thousand feet of passage, A
few thousand feet were also mapped in Fullers, including a section below the
watorfalls - drysuit country. .
• Bill Mauk, of Richmond, seems to be coordinating the work in that area;
subsequent trips have revealed many thousand: foot more of passage in Fullers,
but the nature of the cave makes it extremely dangerous for the non-drysuit
caver. ....

II Let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand, cant
over the sperm whale's head, so that it may lie bottom up; then ascending by a
ladder to the summit, have a peep down the mouth; and were it not that the body.
is now completely separated from it, with a lantern we might descend into the
great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach."
