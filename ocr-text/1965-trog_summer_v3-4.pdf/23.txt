CAVES OF GILES COUNTY
The VoIume, Caves of Virginia, a monumental collection of data on Virginia's
caves, edited By: Henry Douglas, contains complete information available to thë
Virginia Cave Survey through July, 1962. As noted by Mr. Douglas, the book is
only as good as the reports that have been submitted and this varies considerably
from cave to cave and from area to area. The book is the first of its kind in
Virginia and should serve as a stimulus to obtain more information" and to update
and correct that which appears in the original manuscript, The best way that
this can be accomplished" is for individuals to attack specific treas of easy
access, special interest, and/or close familiarity, with the objective of making
data on that area as compIete and accurate as possible. It was on this premise
thætt work was begun during the summer of 1963 to update information on Giles
County, an area of numerous caves and considerable confusion.
The information below should be considered supplemental to Mr Douglas' book
and hopefully will be incorporated into new editions, should they" appear Some
of the information is from the VPI Cave Club files -- especially some of that on
Caves listed as for the record only -- but the majority of it is the result of
personal investigations. All caves in the parts of Giles County covered by the
Radfard" and Pearisburg topographic maps are listed, Information about these caves
is givem only if it is to corrent or add to that given in Caves of Virginia.
Caves investigated and found essentially as shown in Douglas' book are noted "o.k."
Caves which were not visited but seemed, . From the information given and personal
contacts, to be adequately located and described are noted as "apparently o.k."
Caves for which this is believed to be the first filed account are noted by
astericks. Where possible, brief notes are given on caves listed as for the
record only with the belief that, if no other purpose is served, this will at
Ieast aid in preventing duplicate reports (e.g. under different names) of a
single cave,
It is unfortunate that the Giles County work was not completed before I left
the state, but it is hoped that some other investigators will complete the sürvey
and investigate the few questions noted as remaining on these two quadrángles.
Thage that should especially be checked are Brown's #1 and #2, Hog Hole, and
Echol's.
Sketch maps, which are available in the VPI' Grotto files or my personal files
(besides those previously published, see Douglas, p. 707-708), are noted here
but, rot: printte d, largely because in most instances it is not known to whom to
attribute the credit -- or blame,
My wife Bonnie and Read Predmore are to be thanked for repeated and conscien-
ious assistance in checking many caves, mostly of an undramatic character.
