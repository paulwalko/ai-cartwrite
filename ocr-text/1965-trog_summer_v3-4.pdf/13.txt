1ST ANNUAL VA. REGION-MAR SPELEO GO-GO-GOI
Personnel (from VPI): Ed Bauer, Chris. Benowskyj, Charlie Maus, Gary McCutchen,
Alan Armstrong, John Peduzzi, Jim Cooper, Gene Harrison, Barry Whittemore, Mike
Hamilton, R. E. Whittemore.
Organized by the Virginia Region and planned in detail by Lew Bicking,
chairman of the Baltimore Grotto, the Speleo-Go-Go at Aqua Campground in High-
land County. The campground is located where the waters of 'Mill Run, having
been spewed forth from Aqua Cave, spill merrily into the Bullpasture River.
Being in close proximity to interesting and lengthy subterranean tunnels, this
campground is a fine site for such an outing.
Among the noted personalities in attendance at the Go-Go were: The Balti-
more Grotto, i.e. Lew Bicking, who whipped in briefly in the early hours of Sun-
day and returned later at the noon hour; Mason Sproul, without his lawyer's suit;
smiling, talkative Bill Karras who, after arrival on Sunday, became the center
of a gathering of fans and those merely curious; the well-accomplished explorer
and orator, Edward W, Bauer; "Uncle" Gary McCutchen; brillant writer and adven-
turer; and the greatest wonder of our time, valient, warm-hearted, sociable

Various groups varied in the caves Ist
ps varied in the caves visited (fortunately) - some went
ina in Cassell's Cave (good
photographing in Butler Cave, some went rope-pulling in Cassell's Cave (good
sport, old chap). To my knowledge the following caves were visited: Marshall's
(twice), Clark's, Butler, Breathing, Aqua, Three Sister's, Cassell's, and Low-
moor Quarry. Enroute to the Go-Go Jim, Gene, Barry, Whitt and I stopped to ***
search for Withero's Cave, located in a wooded glen approximately three miles
NE of Millboro Springs on the USGS Williamsville 151 quad. A futureâ€œ trip to -
Bath: Co. will no doubt see us again looking for Withero's. Sometimes you finds
them, and sometimes you doesn't,
Not: to be outdone, we explored at least two" of the Three Sister's, located
in a road-cut 300 feet SE of Blowing Cave on Rt. 39 between County Roads 678 and
625. Beyond the conspicuous opening are small caves, for the most part nicely
speleothemed. with thin goda straws, white flowstone dripping in places to form
small thick stalactites, and in one instance, a beautifully-rippled sheet of
bacon rind, most of which lies on the floor. The cave furthest east is the lar-
gest, boasting a minature canyon about six feet long, a 20 foot by 30 foot room
in the middle of which sits an enormous piece of rock (it's very old) and a bit
of maze passage.
We left the caves about 9 and journeyed forth in the fading light of even-
tide to the campground where we cooked in the rain, ate in the rain, and socia-
lized in the rain. Actually, socializing was slightly impaired by the rain and
the absence of our venerable agitator, John Cooper; and the sociable femme of
the Nittany Grotto, Bobbi Nagy.. ''Tis said, though, that some stayed awake to
watch the sun rise ....
