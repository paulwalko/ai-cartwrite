) Gilley's Cave - One of the biggest in the state -- there's no doubt. U.Va.
Grotto runs trips there. They should be able to bring you up to date.
5) Miller's Cove Cave. - A good map will tell the tale. I'm tired of hearing
stories about this cave -- lets get the facts. I've seen less than one
mile but only saw one of the main sections.
Buchanan Saltpeter Cave - If there is 2.5 miles there, I'll be surprised.
Gregg Marland made a special trip there last year to see where the stream
passage went. Ask him. That will about tell the story.
7) Crossroads Cave - Two miles is accurate.
8)
Luray Cavers - A tricky cave to get a fair size of. If we are, talking of
linear distance, however, and I assume we are, then the large map (the one
from which the book reduction was made ) shows about 3,500 ft. Sorry, but .
this one comes off the list. It's big, but not long.
9) Porters Cave - I have personally mapped 8,500 ft. and to my knowledge that
includes everything.
10) Clarks Cave - See my revised map in Caves of Virginia.
roughly two miles, certainly not less than 8,000 ft.
more, but not much to write home about,
This should show
There is probably
11) Endless Caverns - Here's where I will put a drastic end to a roll-of-a" big
myth, Bob Blackburn and I have sketch mapped about 1 mile and this includes
everything but one dubious lead.
12) New River Cave - This one's in your territory.
13) Stonley's Cave - You'll have to rely on' the map unless somebody finds more
cave, I've seen about 3,000 ft, but got tired of wet crawls.
14) Clover Hollow Cave - Another one in your territory.
I'd say a good mile.

15) Here are some more for your list ---
Flannerys Cave, Scott Co. (Clinchport Quad) -- See Fannery Cave in Caves of
Virginia. We mapped it Thanksgiving weekend. The map (in files) shows an
even 5,000 ft. A wet crawl will make it a mile.
Unthanks Cave, Lee Co. (Sneedville Quad) -- Sea Caves of Virginia for pre-.
liminary write-up by me, After I found the cave, Lee Skinner (then of Brisk
tol) sketched about 8000.ft. and Henry Douglas lost the map. Since then,
Hugh Thomas (who will not correspond with me) is supposed to have extended it a
- great deal (information through Dan Finley; who is a reliable source). It
is a good 2 miles and probably more. Someday I'll get a chance to look at
Thomas' map.
