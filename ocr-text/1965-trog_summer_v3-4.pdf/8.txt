is formed at the intersoction of two joints; the entrance slit is at the end
of one joint and a short passage blocked at the end by flowstone makes up the
other joint. Ir the flowstone Were two holes through which a larger opening
could be seen. This was the virgin area.
We entered the cave via cable ladder. The ladder was used to increase our
speed coming out. After checking all other possibilities -- and they were few --
we concentrated our attention on the flowstone. Using a heavy hammer, we
knocked out enough flowstone to get one's head through for a look around.
Beyond the hole was another narrow well about twenty feet high. The floor was
Sand, but there was an opening at the top of the well.
Since we had enlarged the hole in the flowstone as much as we were able to
by hand, we decided to use more drastic methods of rock removal. In the flowme
stone face was one hole extending partially through, and it was large enough
to hole one stick of dynamite,' The hole was cleaned out and one stick of 60%
dynamite placed in position and tamped with damp clay. The fuse was run
through the passage and to the base of the ladder. We allowed ourselves ten
minutes to vacate the cave and remove equipment. Igniting the fuse is one of
the more exciting moments for those with the blasting passion. When everything
was ready, we lit the fuse, pausing briefly as the short flame spat from the
fuse' and disappeared, leaving a jeti of smoke' and the hissing of burning powder,
Then, with no loss of time, we left the cave, removed the gear and waited for ithe
Itumbie Fit was late at night, and we waited in the deep silence surrounding the
mountain, a good time to listen to an explosion. There was a "#hud" in the
cave, the ground jarred slightly, and it was done.
We returned to the cave a week later to drool over the damage and found
much of the fIowstone blown away or broken into pieces which could easily be
removed. The last few chunks were pusžed into the virgin pit, and we climbed
în and chimneyed up to the hole at the top. This hole drained the base of a
secand well, roughly' 20 feet by 5 feet by 20 feet high. The top of the well
went; nowhere, and the joint narrowed down to a few inches beyond the well for
as far as one could see, Satisfied with our work, WG left the cave for a few
thousand" years to wait for water and carbon dioxide to work a little more,
The small area we blasted into was virgin. No possibilities remain,
unless some energetic caver wishes to remove the sand in the lower well.
There is water seepage through the sand. However, the drainage fissure is
probably too small to enter. The trend of the cave is toward John Smith's
Cave, a double well 130 feet deep with a fairly large room at the bottom.
Also in the same arca are Johnson's Pit Caves,
The water table above Klotz is deep, and surface drainage is minor,
Many joints are exposed in the countryside, exhibiting considerable solutional
enlargement, and sinkholes" are few. Perhaps these features indicate a sizable
cave in the youthful or mature stage. Thus fer, so good. But where is the
entrance?
