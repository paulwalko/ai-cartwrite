W is the weight which can be allowed to fall from a point at the center
of a horizontal span of a tightly-stretched Tyrolean traverse without grossly
exceeding the working load" of the rope. These weights are much highör than
those for the same length of rope in a static belay while. catching a ball:

Even though most nylon climbing rope's will withstand a 170-200 lb. fall
with A = 2L0, dangerously increased stress will result from such use of the
rope. The necessity of a dynamic belay is self-evidenti

This shows that, a !trolley-line!! type of belay or safety with nylon is
able to hold a fall with, at worst, a slightly increased tension, and has a
greatly increased fall-holding capability over a static belay under a fall from
the tie-in level. A Manila traverse, although it has a small sag (desirable in
some situations, particularly on a long traverse), has a dangerously low shock-
absorbing capability.

BLASTING IN FRANKIE'S CAVE
In 1960, a party of cavers checking leads in the Klotz area of Giles
County, Virginia, was shown a small pit by a local boy. The cave was completely
explored, with the exception of a small opening below the floor of a short
passage, visible through a slit. Of particular interest to the party was the
movement of air through this hole. "A report of this trip is in the club files.
I have wanted to open this lead in Frankie's dave ever since I heard of
the possibility of virgir cave there, In April, 1965, Dick Moncure, a geology
major and caver, and I'visited the cave with the purpose of determining if the
hole warranted opening, and if so, what equipment would be necessary.
The cave is located near the intersection of Routes 626 and 635 and
above the only prominent sinkhole in the area. The entrance is a horizontal
opening, 12 feet by 2 feet, at the base of a small sink. Immediately inside
the tight entrance, one drops down a slit, and then into a small well. The
drop from the entrance to the bottom of the well is about 25 feet. The well
