:
Once upon a time, in the mystical. Land of Caverns, knights fought with
dragons, witches, and evil barons. These knights had formed themselves into
different groups similar to King Arthur's Round Table.
But there was one knight who did not venture forth on these dangerous
missions. He rescued no fair damsels, nor did he explore and expand the boun-
daries of the Land of Caverns. Instead, this knight practiced the arts of war
and battle, waiting until one of the other knights was trapped, injured, ör
killed on a mission. He would then ride speedily forth and aid his brother-in-
arms.
Lol and splended was the sight of this gallent warrior. Indeed, his spot-
less," gleaming armor outshone the very sun. His robe was embroidered with the”.
purest of gold thread, and woven into the very fabric was the noble name of his
gallent clan. His steed wes larger than most - a truly noblé'beast, It was as
white as newly-fallen snow, with a war cry that struck terror into the hearts of
those who heard it. His followers were hardy, loyal warriors; they would arise
at his summoning - no matter what the hour - and follow in their leader's path to
the place of trouble, where they would carry out various and sundry tasks of la-
bor for their master. Yea, fiercely loyal were these followers; they would turn
upon their own kin, should proper homage not be meted out to their beloved knight.
Thus begins our story, in the central area of the Land of Caverns, in a "*
city noted as a once great seaport and now: the site of the many persons holding ...
high rank in the numbered hierarchy of the officials of the mystical Land of .
Caverns.
So it was, that on the third day of the fourth season in the 63rd .year of..
our Founder and King, this knight regoived a plea for aid through his etheral
communicating device. So urgently was he needed, that forsaking his faithful
steed, he went out to the lair of a giant condor. .
The knight climbed into the nest of the condor and hid himself in the loose
material with his noose of hemp close beside.
Following a wait of many hours, this brave adventurer espied the condor
approaching: Fully 100 feet was the wingspread of this monstrous aerial creation.
It alighted, and as it did so, the knight slipped the noose around the thick leg
of the bird. Yea, as large as a full grown tree, and as rough as bark was this.
leg.
Tightening the noose, the adventurer at the same time startled the bird,
which, frighted further by the unaccustomed weight upon its leg, flew northward,
toward' its ancestral home. .
The bird, after flying for many hours, grew tired and landed, no longer
frightened. The knight alighted and removed himself before the bird should re-
cover. After walking a short way, the knight was able to borrow a steed and in
good time arrived at the scene of his fellow's plight.
