Beyond the Flat Room, a small amount of break-down is encountered and then
the passage continues with a nice smooth floor and 25 foot dimensions. These
features continue until a break-down fill is encountered.
Our trip ended here, since the break-down has a reputation for being
rotten". On the way back to the Flat Room, we made a stop to take some photo-
graphs of the excellent helectities and some stalacti-flat arrays.
It was an excellent trip and we found it hard to believe that we had seen
some 4000 feet of cave in such a short time.
Don't forget - summer cavers who appropriated club carbide will be re-
quired to pay 75Â¢ summer dues. This will, of course, entitle you to a copy of
the summer Tech Troglodyte.
*****
Plan now to attend the next Virginia Region Meeting to be held in Blacks
burg October 9-10. VPI will be the host Grotto, so it's bound to be a success-
ful event.
