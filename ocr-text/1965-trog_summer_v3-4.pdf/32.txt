At the bottom of the grand chasm drop, there is another 20-foot pit. From
here, it is possible to rappel from the lower stream level down to the upper
stream level, so we descended to the upper stream level and explored a short
distance up the upstream passage, then we turned downstream and traversed as
far as the sand room. Beyond here, the crawlways were partially filled with
water. We then returned from the downstream end of the upper stream level and
ascended to the Ante Room by way of Schell's Crossing.
We continued up the various small drops and through the tedious crawlways,
passing ropes and camera equipment along as we went. We made our way to the
surface and returned to Blacksburg in time to catch the late show at Books,
Strings and Things. .

Bauer asked me at the Saturday vertical cavers' luncheon. Since we had had four
hours of sleep during the previous fifty-two hours, the question was ridiculous;
we'd go caving.

One hour later, after getting lost once and confused twice (typical of
Bauer's navigational abilities), we arrived at Salamander Cave. At the cave's
parking lot, we met four other cavers and with them formed a corps for our
adventure,
After attiring outselves in spiked' boots, clothes with tear-proof pockets,
hard hats with lights and other caving paraphernalia, we started down the ravine
toward the cave. On approaching the cave, we met a group of boys and girls
(ages ten to twelve) wearing cloth hats and carrying flashlights. They had just
left Salamander and were looking, for Grotto Cave.
To digress no further, Salamander is a very pleasurable cave to go through.
Passing through an entrance 15 feet wide and three feet high, you proceed for
approximately 75 feet and then drop through a small opening into a narrow stream
passage. This passage maintains its seven-by-ten-foot characteristics for approx-
mately 200 feet and then opens into the Mountain Room". This room has an im-
pressive high mud bank on which rests a large "break-down" mountain Leading
out of the Mountain Room are two passages, one of which bears southeast, is:
approximately 30 by 40 feet, and ends after a couple hundred feet. The other
bears northeast and is very wide, smooth and high. Both are stream passages,
â€¢ The latter-mentioned passage "lyis" and then joins itself beyond the "Flat
Room," which is a medium-sized place, and, true to its name, flat,
