The annual banquet is always a wonderful culmination to the convention and
this was no exception. After a delicious roast beef dinner, the new members to
the board were announced. Tom Barr, the new president, said a few words and
dooor prizes were awarded. Gregg Marland, a former president of the VPI Student
grotto, was awarded a research grant of $250 for his work on' manganese deposits
in caves. .
Roy Davis, the master of ceremonies, did an excellent job and entertained
us all with his adventures of the commercial cave owner.
Brother Nicholas capped the evening with a wonderful, illustrated talk on
caves in various Pacific countries and islands which he has visited. Following
the banquet, of course, were the usual parties, both at the campground and in the
dorm.
Of ridteworthy interest:
The living, eating, camping, and meeting facilities were excellent - very,
very reasonable accomodations for those in the dorms; good food; a campground
within walking distance of the sessions hall; and the meeting halls spacious
and air-conditioned.
The convention was very well-planned, events took place when they were
suppposed to, a good, close relationship was maintained with the university.
The arrangments for socializing" were far better than many had been led
to believe, and this convention proved that a group of our nature can conduct
itself properly in such circumstances.
Preview of next year's convention, celebrating the Society's 25th anniver-
sary, indicated that it will be terrific, Let's have a better representation
from VPI.
