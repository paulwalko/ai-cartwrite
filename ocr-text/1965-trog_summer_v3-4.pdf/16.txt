REFLECTIONS ON THE 1965. NSS CONVENTION ::
... Once again it was convention time, but this year' registration for summer
school forced me to stay on the Tech campus until Thursday, June 17th. That
evening about 9:30 Charlie Maus and I loaded up his TR-with our gear and
headed for Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana.
About 8:30 the next morning, under a blazing sun, we arrived at McNutt
Quad, the central building. It was decorated with a giant banner welcoming the
convention. At first there was so much talk of the Hondo bowling team that we
thought perhaps we were in the wrong place. Finally, however, we spotted Bill .
Cuddington and several others known to us.
Needing a shower and a few hours of sleep, we checked into our very pleas-
ant dormitory rooms and sacked out.
That afternoon, we attended the Practical Session. We were very interes-
ted in a new home-made ascending device and in two papers dealing with under-
ground to surface radio transmission for the purpose of communication and 10-
cation of cave passageways.
After attending the rather quiet Board of Governors meeting and eating
dinner, we sat in on a panel discussion on Cave Owner Relationships moderated by
Vic Schmidt, This disoussion was very interesting, addo some good points, and
dealt with a dangerous situation.
Later in the evening, the slides entered in the salon and the speleological
art entries were shown and all of the photographic awards were presented. Of
particular interest were slides of caves in Australia that showed the beauty and
immensity of the caverns "down under".
Of course, that night there was the nightly party at the campground.
Saturday morning dawned all too bright and early and we were off to the
general and conservation session.. Interesting papers dealt with the progress
of cave gating in the United States, a discussion of the relationship between
the NSS and the National Park Service, and a study by a group from Cave Research
in the Flint Ridge System on the use of cane torches as illumination.
: A fitting finale to this moming session was a preview of the 166 Conven-
tion to be held in Sequoia Park, California. Dave McClurg clued us in and it
sounds like another good one.
After a vertical cavers luncheon (was that blonde really a vertical caver?)
at which & forthcoming pamphlet on vertical caving schniques by the Huntsville
Grotto was discussed, Charlie' and I got together with Tommy Tucker, his three-
legged dog; and several others and headed for nearby Salamander Cave. .. ..
After caving, we refreshed ourselves in a tremendous swimminghole at a
nearby quarry. We then went back to the dorm to get ready for the banguet.
