The other spring is one-fourth mile north of the railroad crossing at Eggleston
at the base of a high dolomite cliff. To my knowledge, no investigation has
been made of the underground course of Sinking Creek, but it seems likely that
the first of the above mentioned springs represents the resurgence and that
the stream flows essentially through the alluvium below.its surface channel.
Tawney's Cave, Giles County, Va. (6/30/63).. Less than one ounce of fluor-
osein was placed in the cave stream at the bottom of the formation room. Vis-
ible green coloration was noted at the spring along Sinking Creek (about 250
straight-line feet away) eight minutes later and persisted for eight minutes.
This was a simple experiment by a fellow who had never played with fluorosein
before.

Gregg Marland -- Recipient of 1965 Research Grant
The Origin of Manganese and Iron Minerals in Limestone Caves" is the topic
of a study which won Gregg Marland the 1965 National Speleological Society Re-
search Grant of $250. This award is made annually to a student writing a gradu-
ate thesis on a speleological subject. Mr. Marland is' a' student in the Departa
ment of Earth Sciences, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri. His research
will include analysis of the chemical composition and mineralogy of the deposits,
determination of the source and characteristics during: different seasons of the
depositing water, and evaluation from thermochemical data as to whether or not
the deposition occurs within the stability fields of the minerals at. equilibrium.
