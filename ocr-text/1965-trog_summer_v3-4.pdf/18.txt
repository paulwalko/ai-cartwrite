Your big cavell list is something that needed to be done. It really shows
how poorly some of these llwell-known" caves are actually known. A couple of
comments. First, I hope you hear from Holsincer, Some of his stuff in south-
West Virginia tops ä mile. Douglas lists Cudjo's (Lee County) as a mile and I
believe 'Unthank is the one Holsincer has run well on up. One I'm wondering
about is Beacon, I've never really figured out whether it's in Virginia or
West Virginia, but it's within a half mile or so of the line (probably in West
Virginia) and looks on the map like just over a mile. I tried for a year to
get some of you guys down to Buchanan Saltpeter with me. I've been in it twice
and not seen an end... I can't guarrantę two and a half miles, but it's a
mighty bic (and nice) cave.'

. Glad to see also, the sentiment on belayed rappels. I've always main-
tained that the only use for a prusik is when you are unsure that the rappel :
rope is of sufficient length to reach down and that it is renerally more of
a hazard than a safety device. An over-head belay does have a place; certainly,
on all ladder climbs and on novices with few exceptions (first or second rap-
pel). After that, give the rope a good test and then rely on it. .
Pretty good issue overali.
Your pal,
Grege.

Dear Robert;
A few comments on your "Virpinia's Biggest Cavesh article in the Spring
issue of the Troglodyte. "Most of the following is up-to-date from the Vir-
ginia Cave Survey files. Annotations where necessary.
1)
Butler 'Cave - no commenti Who is plotting the recent surveying rumored.
to be going on there?
:
Breathing Cave - About four miles is all, I imagine. Penn State map is
accurate.
3) Newberry-Bane Cave - I've seen two miles. Get Thierry's survey notes
and you might clear this one up. Else you'll have to go on tho present
map and rumors.
