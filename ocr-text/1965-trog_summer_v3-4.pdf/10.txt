This he was told, that the other had been moved by the tale of a fair
maiden, who told of the wonderful treasures contained in a certain untenanted
castle. The knight, with two followers, had entered the castle and descended
one of the torture pits, but, the castle being under an evil spell, the top of :
the pit grew narrow and the gallent adventurer could not return: Gathering his
equipment about him, thc. just-arrived rescuer tried many spells, both potent and
powerful. These, however, avoiled him naught, and he was unable to aid the
trapped knight. Finally, with the aid of a magician, Nobel by name, he succeoded
in destroying the evil castie, so that it would never again trap unwary knights. .
The knight then called forth for the wandering balladeers and tellers of
tales to gather close around him. These gentle men devote their lives to
travel, appearing ever all of the Land of Caverns, and bringing news of other
areas. They immortalize heroic deeds, shameless braggards, and evil workings
with song and word. :
Then the knight spoke to these gathered wanderers, and he bade them jour-
ney forth with the sad tidings. His eyes shone like lightening as he expressed
fear that evil forces would in some way profit by the defeat of the unfortunate
knight. This, said the brave rescuer, had been the case when another brave
knight had been trapped and killed in the Castle of Crystal, near the Mammoth
Castle, in the Land of Karst.
Thus the knight bade farewell to the people of this northern province, and,
proceeding to retrace his path, found the giant bird in the same place where he
had departed from it, clinging to the bope, he waited patiently, and the bird,
becoming concerned about its nest, flew back to its home. Forsaking the condor,
he entered the city, to be greeted joyfully by his merry band.
And there sit they, even unto this very day, awaiting only a plea for help
to stir them to action, And, oh, how they dreamily savor the tiles of heroic
feats that the balladeers sing of their glorious doeds.
Thus, Gentle Reader, ends our story. As to what it has to do with caving,
look again at it, and you will see, The Land of Caverns is the eastern United
States, the knights are cavers, the dragons and witches are the dangers of
caving, and the evil barons are unreasonable landowners. There is, of course,
much more symbolism, which we leave, to the reader to discern. But, who, some
might ask, is the knight who is the main character in our tale? Think on, kind
sirs, but if ye be truly puzzled, send 25â‚¬ to: Uncle'Gary's Bedtime Stories,
Box B-5, Va. Tech Station A, Blacksburg, Va. The answer will be returned in a
plain brown envelope.
