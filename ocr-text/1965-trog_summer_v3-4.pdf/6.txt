II. Shock loads on a Tyrolean traverse
The falling weight which will stress a Tyrolean traverse to its working
load will be computed for the following cases: 3/8-inch, 7/16-inch, and inch
nylon rope; assuming a 15% stretch at working load; and inch Manila rope,
assuming a 3% stretch at working load
A = Lsin A
W VS AAAAGH!
For 15% stretch: A = 290 35.50 d in A = ,49382
The stress-strain curve of a rope is highly nonlinear (see Belaying the
Leader). It can be closely approximated by a parabola.
TW ---# Tok €2
· Tw = 800 lbs. for a 3/8-inch nylon rope
Tw = 1100 lbs. for a 7/16-inch nylon rope
Tw = 1300 lbs. for a -inch nylon rope
T = tersion
75% € 6 = stretch/unit length
The area under the curve, which represents the energy absorbed per foot
of rope, is equal to 1/3 TS = E
E = 1/3 (800)(.75) = 40 ft-lbs/ft
E = 1/3 (1100)(.15) = 55 ft-lbs/ft
E = 1/3 (1300)(.15) = 65 ft-lbs/ft
for 3/8-inch nylon rope
for 7/16-inch nylon rope
fpr 1-inch nylon rope
Note that this is per foot of Lo, the unstretched length.
A = I sin A = 1.15 Lo (.49382) = 0.56789L.
However, there are 210 feet of rope available for absorbing shock.
potential energy of W = energy absorbed by rope
0.56789WL0 = 2 E L
0.56789W = 2 E
W = 2EW
-56789 = 3.5218 E
