The stretch of a nylon rope at its "working load" (generally accepted as
20% of its breaking strength) will almost always be within the limits of 10%
and 20%. However, it can be seen that at this stretch, the Tyrolean traverse
becomes substantially equal to a two-point sling at an included angle of ,120°,
im which the tension in each leg is equal to the load. Thus, it can be seen
that a nylor rope used in a Tyrolean traverse can support a load approximately
equal to its a safe working load" without grossly exceeding this stress.

The angle A at: which a load of 200 lbs. will produce a rope stress of 530

Since a manila rope stretches about 3% when dry, and 10% when wet, it can
be pulled up tight. (By pulled up tighth, it is meant pulled up as tight as
passible by hand. Use of rigging, such as a 2-prusik 2-karabiner hoist, will
take up some of the rope stretch. While this is unimportant in nylon, it can
cause the stresses to be excessive in dry manila.)
