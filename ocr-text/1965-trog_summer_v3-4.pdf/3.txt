EDITOR'S COLUMN
The age-ald VPI Grotto has somehow survived one of its best years, Not
only did every Saturday see at least two or three trips. Ieave campus, but not
a single Friday night passed without a songfest, beer party, and/or drunken
orgy.
The "Tech Trashcollector'll staff would like to take this opportunity to
thank Bob Robins, Chester Greco, Bob Mallis, Mr. Plank, and. Dr. West for prom
viding space for these events. We would alsoʻlike to thank John Eads, "Ferdin
Thompson, Henry Stevens, Mike Bohn, Jack Keat, Bob Croft, and several others
who provided varying degrees of instrumentation which,' along with the beer, help
make these events a success. And to those of you, who, on occasion, couldn't
quite hold it all, we would like to extend a special note of thanks because of
the suffering you expenenced the next day to provide the club with so many
Iaughs the night before. Let's hope next year is just as good.
The big social event of this past quarter was, as usual, the club picnic.
Thanks to good planning by Paul Helbert, Whitey Eubank, Bob Mallis, and Dixon
Hoyle, the affair was quite a success. To those of you who didn't make it home
that might', we say "Can you think of anything better to do with two: kegs of beer?!
And to those of you who found Trout Creek so enjoyable, we, say, "Congratulations!".

Probably what will prove to be the most significant political event in
club history occurred this year: the demise of the obnoxious leadership system.
Naturally, this event was closely followed by an overall increase in caving
activity, and not, as some people predicted, by an increase in fatal injuries
within the club. Perhaps the fact that members are now getting more caving ex-
perience has made them safer cavers,
There will be those among us who will sigh nostalgically for the days when
they could approach a group of neophytes and draw looks of awe by saying, "I'm
a qualified-ABC-Horizontal Vertical Hero LEADERT" Then, of course, there are
those who, with the loss of their status symbol, left our fold. Tski You
should have known it was com ing. For the past two years, the members who have
been doing all the caving never had time to pass the ridiculously complicated
requirements. A meaningless ordeal is gone, we hope, forever,
To thase of you who have been puzzled by the somewhat sporadic appearance
of this journal of speleology, I shall devote à few lines to explain our "policies,
