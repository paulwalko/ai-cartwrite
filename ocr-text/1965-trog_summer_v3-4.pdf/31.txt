TRIP REPORTS
CHAMBERS CAVE

Personnel: Dick Hughes, Mike Youso.

:
Chambers Cave is located at the end of an enormous ponor sinkhole which
extends one mile along Peter's Mountain. A stream flows into the entrance and
ranges from dry in summer to wet in winter,
The entrance is a rocky crawl into the cave for about 50 feet. The cave
itself is relatively unexplored and has never been surveyed. It consists of
two levels: the upper level, which branches off and up from the steam passage,
and the lower level.
The upper level can be reached from several spots on the lower level, and
once in this level, sinks which go down to the lower level are encountered. On
the lower level, near the end of the cave, there is a crawl of one hundred' feet
which leads to the Ship Room. This room is over 100 feet high. From here, an
upper passage leads to some musical formations.
Chambers is a large cave which has several unexplored portions beyond the
stream and on the upper level. There are some nice formation, including a
rather large one called the Coliseum. This cave is wet at times, but normally
is moderately dry.
Opinion:
It is worth the trip!

Our original intent was to survey a large side passage off the upper stream
level, but lack or proper equipment caused us to change our plans.
The road proved to be too muddy, so we took the one-mile hike up to the
cave. Upon reaching the entrance, we were disgusted to see that someone had
placed a large manila rope as a permanent fexture in the entrance, Also, a
wooden ladder, elaborately constructed in four sections, had been placed at
the first drop. Closer inspection of the upper levels revealed a definite in-
crease in vandalism, now that the cave is more accessible.
Steve and I had decided to explore the "dynamite passage," which forms the
upstream end of the lower stream level. We explored as far as the point where
the stream enters the passage, then returned to the top of the first waterfall
where the stream plunges down to the 500-foot level.' Having no ropes, we were
unable to explore that section of the cave. Instead, we chimneyed out, to the
belay loft for a better look at the waterfall, then took a crawlway back into
the grand chasm.
