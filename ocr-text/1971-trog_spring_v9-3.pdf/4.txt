PRESIDENT'S COLUMN
I am most pleased to be your president for the com-
ing year. I will work to the best of my ability to at-
tain the proper recognition for the club, This column
will outline some of my thoughts.
I hope that our training program will strengthen
with respect to introducing trainees (and regular mem-
bers) to all aspects of caving. Caving is a very diverse
science, Exposure to all fields will give one an educa:
tion from which he will be able to field plays from di-
verse persons associated with the subterranean environ-
ment, For example, an elementary knowledge of geology
aids in the locations of new caves and their entrances,
Mapping underground passageways is a growing activity
and serves many important functions, Vertical expertise
is an art that can be a sport in itself as well as serv-
ing as a tool for gaining access to the inner depths of
some' caves, Only after seeing it all may one single out
interest areas. Then he can use his talents to investi-
gate his interests. It does not matter whether it is
stream tracing or photography, just so long as one is
aware of all the various aspects of caving.
Once one has mastered the various caving techniques,
it has proven most profitable to visit other caving areas
outside the Virginias. Whether it be a muddy cave in
Pennsylvania or a pit cave in Alabama, caves in other
locales offer new and interesting challenges. But the
most exciting part is meeting the cavers of those areas
and exchanging techniques, new equipment, and ideas,
New mapping techniques, a new vertical ascender, and
thoughts on landowner relations are just a few of the
many exchangable subjects. It's a give-and--take propo-
sition. Everyone benefits. For these reasons I am en-
couraging caving activity by individuals in other states,
My strongest feelings center around club unity. The
club's activities have been a way of life for me the past
four years. There are already several traditional club
activities that promote the fine fellowship I speak of.
The picnic, banquet, and club projects have been the
major events in the past, An annual float trip has re-
cently become a yearly highlight, Regional events and
the Convention promote fellowship among cavers from other
areas as well as establishing a sense of identity with
one's own Grotto, VPI has the closest knit group of in-
dividuals I have ever witnessed. This is evidenced most
clearly by our daily gatherings at Owens for meals and
our frequent group participation in activities other than
caving. In the future I would like to see club caving
trips on a scale similar to our club project weekends.
I have in mind three specific areas: Bath County,
