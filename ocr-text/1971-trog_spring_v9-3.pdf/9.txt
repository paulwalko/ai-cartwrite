MAIL ORDERED CAVER
Hey Gang, this is the Mailbag speaking, Yes,
that's right, the Mailbag, more often than not just
known as "the Bag". Sure, you know me, I'm the one who
gets up at the Grotto meetings during Committee Reports
and does her best to bore everyone to sleep with all
sorts of trivia and stuff that comes to the club via the
US Mail. After all the time that I have held this
position, I still wonder why "Mailbag" is considered
a committee; I singly comprise it and I suppose that
means I qualify as chairman, Jeez, I've been coming
up in front of the Club for quite some time. I've
babbled on under the presidential sighs of Vig, Moose,
Bobaloo, and now there's Birdman, wow,
Well, for some of you trainees who wonder if I
was born with the VPI Cavo Club PO box key in my mouth,
before me there was Mailbag Mike Kayes, the Polish Guru,
and before him was the ubiquitous R.E. Whittemore, and
before that I believe it was Glenn Davis. That's as far
back as I care to go, but it sounds like a good field
for trivia seekers,
We've been known to have gotten all kinds of neat
stuff in the mail, A coulple of years ago we got a
questionnaire from the local congressman who was up
for re-election. So, several of us got together, pooled
our resources, answered questions concerning opinions
of the Draft, Vietnam, and political affiliations,
made it totally absurd, signed it A.I.Cartwright and
sent it in. Well, a couple of weeks later, we got a
response telling us where A.I. stood in political terms.
I think we put extremes on the left and right ends of
his poll. Oh, well. We also keep getting electric
bills for a Burley Lanb and other people who probably
don't even exist, For a while the library kept insisting
to us that Al Hurt had a book long overdue. We've
even gotten scented love letters that were supposed to
be in the box under us. Applause for the PO efficiency?
Seriously, I really enjoy reading all the publica-
tions and things we get in the mail, We exchange with
about 60 other caving organizations and we a looking
to exchange or subscribe to more. I just wish that more
people would read the exchange mail we get. After I
rap about it at the meetings, it lays to rest in Club
Files, (See THE TECH TROGLODYTE,Vol. IX, no.2) Sure,
alot of it is local stuff and private jokes, but if you
look closely, there is a wealth of information. All
of us get hung up and tied down to our own Grotto
and usually become all too familiar with our own prob-
lems. Every club has its own hassels and with the
exception of names, caves and regions, they are all
nearly the same, Grotto Chairmen want more support
