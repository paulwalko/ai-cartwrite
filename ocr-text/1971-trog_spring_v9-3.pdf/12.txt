EARLY HISTORY OF CLOVER HOLLOW
April 11, 1943, a cave in Clover Hollow near
Newport, Virginia was looked into by the VPI Grotto.
That same day they put sawdust in the entrance and it
came out of Smoke Hole. No exploring of the cave
was done, because they were not prepared for a verticle
entrance.
The first trip in Clover Hollow was on May 8-9
of that same year. It consisted of Barns, Burns,
A. Loyd, R.N. Southworth, H.V, Yarns, and E.F. Moore,
They explored passage off Hud River to the stream and
"found passage winding; having no end we came to several
tremendous rooms, one 2001 ceiling, another full of
fossils, crystals, formations etc. and another flat
angular wall; different structure from everything
else," If you are familiar with Clover Hollow, you
probably recognize this as the passage from the Canyon
Room to the Gypsum Room (fossils, crystals) and the
Fault Room or Library (flat angular walls).
The next trip on record in the Grotto files was
August 7-8, 1943. This well written report by R.N.
Southworth has Dr. H.WJackson, who was in charge,
surveyers were A. Crabb, T.W. Edminster, Golo Jones,
H.V. Yarus, L. E. Andrew, and R.N. Southworth, Explorers
were H.W, Jackson, E.F.loore, C.C. Beard, R.B. Thompson,
Dr. J. Murray, 3. Weiss, and McDorman. Four hours after
they entered the cave they had all the equipment and
they surveyed to :the bottom of the Grand Canyon Room,
Most of the cave was seen during this expedition,
except what we know as the Andrew's Room and the ad-
joining passage. This passage was believed to go to
the Gypsum Room or even be part of it. In the Gypsum
Room they found sand that was several feet thick and
contained a large percentage of Gypsum crystals, The
survey was started there and worked back to the Canyon
Room, The Thistle Tube was pushed and many "Devonian
Fossils" were found. Then they surveyed down Mud
River, "once a river, now only dry clay", (Mud River
was not pushed and not on their map). They found
a rimstone dam 28' high and surveyed into a small room
that is a formation section. Though they did not say,
they obviously rappelled 30' down to the Big Stream
Room. The survey party followed the stream and pushed
it very far, but never mapped it, They named this
section Idiot's Delight, appropriately after Charlie
Beard, They pushed Idiot's Delight until it cam to
another stream (1970-71 Survey was not as lucky).
After this they surveyed back to the Caryon Room with
only a sketch of Idiot's Delight,
