appropriate! ) This room, and its adjoining passages was
truely a climax to the afore discovered formations.
And so, as, koger Baroody puts it, "It took two years
and about 30 cave trips to map the cave and get all the
dann passage sorted out" and even at that he was still
getting lost right up to the end. I personally think
it's fantastic what he did - Paxton's is truely a con-
fusing maze of passageways-with 3.4 miles under a rel-
atively small area of ground, but definitely well worth
the visit,
I have not included a map of Paxton's with this re-
port for a couple of very simple and I feel, important,
reasons. Paxton's Cave is not a cave to visit without
someone who has been there before. It's a very easy cave
to become lost in, and for that reason you should look up
various people like Roger Baroody (WVAC'S), George Neal
(VPI), Tom Roehr, Ed Morgan (VPI), or myself, who know
the cave, before you visit it. This would be more for
your personal enjoyment than anything. The second
reason is from a conservationist's viewpoint. Should the
map get into wrong hands, Paxton's could become so
horribly vandalized as to never warrant visits again,
So, all you cavers who would appreciate the wonders
of perfect soda straws, helictites, snow white calcite
crystals and cauliflower, dogtooth spar, gypsum needles,
and massive flowstone walls, get on the photographic
trip to Paxton's Cave at the Convention. We'll be leav-
ing Sunday, June 13 at one PM, and should be back about
11 PM, You'll see the "butterfly", "camel rock", Christ-
mas Room, and Worn Garden, not to mention a great variety
of geology and fossil covered walls. This would be a
good cave for not too young children who have had some
experience climbing and chimneying.
See you at the Convention!

But people can't, unhappily, invent their
mooring posts, their lovers, and their
friends, anymore than they can invent
their parents. Life gives these and also
takes them away, and the great difficulty
is to say Yes to life. -James Baldwin
