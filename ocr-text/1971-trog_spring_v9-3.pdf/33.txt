Then there are of course our close allies fron
Alabama, Tennessee, West Virginia and Texas, The more
the merrier - uh- the more the efficient, I mean,
But these people are not Tech students, We can't
have any non-students, university policy, you know,
Gee, it sure would be a shame is we didn't know
when old Burruss would go. Such a nice structure,
Tsk, tsk,
All right! All right!
oh, we won't be greedy, just provide us with all
the equipment we will need for exploration and surveying,
acedemic considerations, D room in Owen's to serve us
steak every night, also access to the Stadium and Cole-
seun for training purposes and, of course, a field house,
A. field house? What do you need a field house
for?
What do the jocks need one for?
Ahem, We'll have to see...
By the way, one of our Club members is in arche-
techture, and he'll have the blue prints ready for you
by next week.
Is that all?
No, as a matter of fact, we would like to make
an extended budget request of $1200,
What on earth for?
We need some working capital for our or- uh,
speleo-seminars, ljust take breaks from all the hard work.
And one more thing.
(gasp! ) What now!! ?
We would like to arrange diplomatic immunity
for all the cavers at the NSS Convention in June,
And how many is that going to be?
Oh, 600 or so. Maybe more,
(Silence, then the sound of collapsing body and
the swinging receiver against a hard surface.)
