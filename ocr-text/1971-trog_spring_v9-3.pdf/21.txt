occasionally blocked by masses of ice in one crawlway.
The Haines entrance is located on private property
Although this entrance is at first tight, it soon
opens up into a large passage about 500' long which
contains two pits of 60' leading to lower levels.
Beyond this passage one has a rather tight passage of
200' before getting into the main passage,
On the surface, the main steeam in the cave, and
most of the passage runs parallel to East River Mount-
ain, along a line of sinkholes, Upstream holds good
promise of an entrance as there is considerable organic
debris washed in from an area with several larse
sinkholes. Approximately 1000" downstream from the
Haines Entrance the cave goes under the Virginia line
and continues for another 1000' to where there are
indications of a Virginia entrance. The surface in
this area has not been checked out as of yet, Already
Beacon is the only cave that goes under the Virginia-
West Virginia Line, A Virginia entrance would greatly
enhance Beacon's reputation,
The cave is a storehouse of life. It has the
greatest proliferation of cave life I have yet encount-
ered,
There have at present been observe three species
of salamander in the cave, The' commonest of the
three is the only aquatic one. These average three
inches in length, are pale orange, have a squared
off snout, bright red gills and are definately not
blind. They have very tenatively been identified as
Desmognathus fuscus. They are quite common in the
calm sandy pools upstream fron the Haines entrance.
The second species is found in only one part of the
cave, at a particular rock near the downstream pool,
These salamanders are five to six inches long. A
dull reddish brown color with black spots. There
has been no attempt at identification as yet, The
third species has only been observed twice. It is the
common cave salamander Eurycea lucifuga, bright orange
with black spots and four to five inches long.
The cave also houses a considerable bat population,
Several hundred are located in the Bat Room and ad-
joining areas inside the Beacon entrance. The only
species so f .r observed is the little brown bat
(Ilyotis lucifugus lucifugus). Bats also occur isolated
in other parts of the cave.
In quiet upstream pools there aan be observed
thousands of tiny isopods. These are the only true
troglobitic species in the cave,
