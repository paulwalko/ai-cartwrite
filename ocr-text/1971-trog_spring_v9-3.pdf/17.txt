PIG HOLE
Pig Hole Cave is located under the property of A. B.
Porterfield on Johns Creek Mountain in southeastern
Giles County, Virginia in limestone of the mid-Ordivician
period, Total passage length is just over a thousand
feet. It has an entrance drop of 116 feet and the rappel
from the Empire Ledge to the bottom of Hess' Hollow is
Approximately 200 feet. The cave is characterized by
large rooms and wells and many bats, the population of
which has declined greatly, but they appear to be return-
ing.
A survey led by Bob Barnes in 1948 resulted in the
establishing of a sinkhole above the back portion of the
cave where leaves had been found. "With the aid of
several sturdy diggers (from VPI Grotto?- you've got to
be kidding!) and 24 sticks of dynamite a breakthrough
was accomplished in two weekends of hard work" (and prob-
ably much beer). The back entrance is a 10 foot vertical
climb through a sewer pipe. (I don't know why it's called
the back "entrance" because most people rappel the en-
trance drop and exit through the rear)
The cave was first entered in 1943 using a block
and tackle rig. Large deposits of bat guano have been
found along with brushite and taranakite, which are the
first recorded natural prescense of these minerals in
the US. In the area of the bat guano (in the rear por-
tion of the cave) markings can be seen on the wall which
were first thought to have been put there by early man
(cavers!). A study conducted by R, John W. Murray of
the VPI Chemistry Department has determined that these
markings were formed naturally.
Pig Hole was originally named Earl's Death Cave (I
guess someone named Earl deathed in it) and was changed
to the present name when a pig, which was very much dead,
was found lodged in a crawlway.
