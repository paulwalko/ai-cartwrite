THE TECH TROGLODYTE -
1971
My, my, that's a large one isn't it?
(cringe )
Now we're not sure, but analyzed sand samples,
by our own geologist, indicate a possibility of a very
large cave, indeed. Our Overland survey crews' have
determined that the likely direction of passage trave.s
in a N 45 W direction,
Is that any where toward town, hopefully?
No as a matter of fact, it appears to run in a
beeline toward the administration building...
Oh
no, not Burruss: Hall!!!
Oh, don't worry, it's not toc likely that the
weight of the building will collapse the cave,
Oh my goodness gracious.... Is there anyway that
you can do anything about it? To determine where this
forboding menace will strike? Burruss topple! Ohhhh!
Well first of all, we'd have to make a detailed
map, then an extensive structural geologic analysis,
of course I louresien tracing, and naturally thorough
phycological, mycological and zoological studies...
Excellant, excellant! How soon can you begin?
Tonight. But wait a minute. Cavers, after all
are human, and such a project as this will take several
years, and unless properly motivated the club may aban-
don this project...
Oh no! You can't do that! What is needed to
motivate cavers?
Well, we'll need some good strong leaders and
some relief crews.
Such as?
Well, first we'll have to try to get Jim and
Linda Hixson,
Sounds good; a caver and his wife,
Linda's not his wife, that's his dog. Best damned
passage pusher we have.
(shudder!! )
