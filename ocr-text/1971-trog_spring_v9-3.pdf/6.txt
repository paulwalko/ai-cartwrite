THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1971
MY TURN! ! !
Well, it's time for the VPI Cave Club to get a new
editor 'cause I'm getting married! (You knew there was
gonna be problems with a girl editor, huh?!!)
I've had an interesting time being editor for four
issues now; I think I might even miss it a little.....
eventually...like in a couple hundred years! Seriously
though, being editor of The Tech Troglodyte has its prob-
lems - like you make a lot of enemies because you don't
publish someone's poem or a trip report (that he must
have worked on for all of maybe seven and a half minutes
at the lunch table to turn it into Doug because it's re-
quired to write one in order to get into the club) or be-
cause one or two of the other editors don't like what
you're trying to say in your editor's column so you let
one of them do it, or because you might have the wrong
address of some subscriber in the files and he hasn't.
received his Trog in about two years and wants to know
why, or because maybe it's all your fianc√© hears is "gotta
get the Trog done - don't talk to me now".
.
But it's not rally all problems. There's always
someone (bless his heart) who tells you "It's a pretty
good Trog", Janet, Guy and I feel great about such com-
pliments, we tell Doug Perkins that it's a quality print-
ing job and umpteen-million others that they "sure are a
good stapler", and most of all, say thanks to all the
writers for getting those articles to us by two weeks past
deadline 'cause if we'd really stuck to the deadline we
never would have had anything to staple together between
the covers!
Thanks again for letting me be editor - it was really
a very rewarding experience. And gang, please help your
next editor; write articles before midterms come around so
you'll have the time!
