SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1971
PICTURE PERFECT CONSERVATION
Recently I was given the task of putting together
the club's Photo Album, I took on the job with great
enthusiasm and was very thankful for an opportunity to
serve the V.P.I, Grotto, (other than mapping). In working
on the Photo Album, I have gained a deeper understanding
and appreciation of caves and the need for conservation.
A few minutes ago I was arranging the pictures of
Clover Hollow, 1946's and 1949's. I was in Clover Hollow
in 1970 and the difference in appearance of the cave is
unbelievable. Thanks to the pictures, I can see what
Clover Hollow used to look like--I don't have to use my
imagination to add on to the ends of broken formations,
And an even more fearful contrast is the past and present
condition of the Forest Room in New River Cave, Now the
Forest Room is filled with broken stalagtites and
stalagmites, but once it was un-damaged. Before man came ,
it kept its own beauty in one piece--instead of shattered
on the floor. Thanks to pictures from long ago the
original beauty of the caves remains to be exhibited.
If you are a caver, you live conservation. Conservation
should be placed above all else. I am not blaming the
"Conservationist" caver for the vandelism of caves, I am
only trying to emphasize a very important conservation
practice, All caves under normal use and with proper
care will still change in appearance, If a picture is
taken, the original appearance is preserved. A picture
of a cave will not change -- and that is what I label --
PICTURE PERFECT CONSERVATION.
Useless
P.S. Please take pictures of caves and keep them
in an album, better yet, give a copy to your grotto or
the N.S.S. But if you prefer to keep your own personal
photographs of caves--will them to the N.S.S.

It's not like beer, and not like bourbon
It's effect on cavers is awful disturbin
Some sing, some dance, and others get sick
Some get lovin' with a cute young chick
But me, I'm different, wierdest of all,
I hold hands with a guy named Hall.
