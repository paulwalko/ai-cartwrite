from older members. Editors beg for material, Saftey
and Conservation Chairmen bitch about active consider-
ation, Student Grottoes moan about membership turnover,
novices write the same run of the mill trip reports,
Grottoes reprint other Grottoes' feature articles and
there's always the old conflict of electric versus
carbide caving. It makes you come to grips about
your own quibbling and fussing when you find out that
most every other Grotto experiences the same thing.
OR
Alot of newsletters come to us and they run the
full spec 'rum of excellant to just plain thrown-
together, but no matter what the degree of literary
merit, they all show the spirit of the individual
Club or Grotto, One can learn alot about other cavers
and their attitudes and pretty soon you can recognize
names and caves and NSS politics begins to mean a
little more than someone else's hassels. So, whether
a publication is "good" or "bad" it nevertheless has
its value. This brings us around to our own publication.
VPI has quite a heritage; THE GROTTO GRAPEVINE, started
in 1943, I am told, was the first caving publication
of its kind in this country. It continued well into
the late '50's when it became disorganized, but was
revived in 1962 and christened THE TECH TROGLODYYE.
In the last year or two, the Trog has gotten alot of
support from the Club in the form of material and
with the aid of talented artists and a "let's get
done and done well" editor, we've put out some pretty
decent printed pages.

So, after gettin a little side-tracked and giving
ourselves a pat on the back, I'll quit.
Keep those cards and letters coming!
