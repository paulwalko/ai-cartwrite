BUYING IN BLACKSBURG
A convention-goer's guide
to purchassins equipment
There you are; you' e finally made it to Blacksburg
for the 1971 NSS convention and you're going to do some
c√†ving in all those great caves roundabout. But suddenly
you find you left your rope at home. Or you don't have
any carbide. Or you've lost your carabiners and sling. Or
may be your skrungy caving coveralls (which haven't been
washed for at least the last five trips ) finally fell apart,
Time to panic?? Not while VPI Grotto is taking care of
you!
Below you will find a list of places to buy all
kinds of gear that you might need; anything from spare
parts for your lanp to Kelty packs and ropes.
First of all, two supply sources are worthy of spec-
ial mention:

burg, a branch office of Appalachian Outfitters in Vienna,
Virginia, Here can be found all sorts of goodies for
caving, climbing, camping, and backpackins. A few itens
