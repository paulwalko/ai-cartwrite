minutes. This was not the end of my agony though,
You had back. This was part I always dreaded because
the contraptions you used had teeth that knawed at me,
You won again,
Incident #3
This happy event happened on a site near straley's,
You were just about to tie me to something to pull
on me when one of you changed hes mind. He tied me
to himself instead and proceded to drag me across the
ground. This did not last for long for I was picked
up by the other two who started to pull on me, I was
getting quite up tight over all this and started planning
how I would get my revenge. I decided that when they
let go of me I would go after the nearest one and
try to whip him. Ah, my chance had come for they released
me. I aimed for the nearest neck I could find and
hit it, The die was cast. Gold Line had prevailed,
Incident #4
This one was a winner. It happened in Spence,
You had finished putting me through mud, a bit of
burning friction, and a small amount of tooth grind-
ing. I thought you were finished with me, but you
just weren't satisfied. You had to tie all of your
muddy junk equipment on me and pull it up, didn't
you? Well, this was the last straw. I had to do
something. There was an overhang near me, the perfect
place for a hangup. That's exactly what it turned
out to be too. You could neither pull me up nor pull
me down so you just left me alone for a while, I
caused you plenty of trouble and you deserved it,
I was satisfied thoroughly.
Well, I leave it up to you. Are you all going to
stand by and watch ne suffer? Are you all going to
watch me slowly cleteriorate? Are you all going to
see me rot into an eternal hell? I know you are,
you sadistic cavers,

I asked for everything
that I might enjoy life.
God gave me life
that I might enjoy everything.
