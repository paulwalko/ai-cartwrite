SURVEY
VPI cavers are known for many things throughout the
campus, the region, the NSS - etc. Some may be good. and
some bad, but quite a few are interesting. I became in-
terested in the little things a VPI caver contends with
while underground, such as how do you carry spent car-
bide?, and how do you wear your hair? This last
question proved quite fascinating. Mike Frieders swears
by Pierre's in Paris, but Mike Dunn, along with the
long-haired girls, prefers old-fashioned pigtails.
Then there are the more truthful ones who replied
"not very well" and "seldom". Steve Kark likes his in
a bun, but Ed Morgan uses perhaps the most conventional
method- the mud permanent,
Out of the 30 surveys turned in there were only 3
coverall wearers (Hixson of course!) and 3 sweatshirt
users. Everyone else chose "dirty" or "old" in refer-
ence to attire. The only two who profeesed to wearing
sneakers were Nancy and Useless(?!) and everyone else
chose some type of boots (really now, Pit-"holy"?)
Four people started their caving outside the VPI
Grotto, including our only electic caver- Fred Hines.
Jim Hixson holds the longest caving record with 15
years, and Paul Broughton and Ed lorgan have 11 and 10
respectively. There are quite a few who claim about 2
years experience,
Baby bottles outranked everything else as carbide
and water carriers, and tied with baggies for spent
carbide. Then there's always Kark, who claims he eats
it all. The majority preferred to carry gear in packs,
though about a dozen let it hang on their belts, Jim
Altman uses loops sewn inside his coveralls! Most
surveying gear ended up in pockets, and most food
wasn't even there in the first place, Spare parts
came in film cans, and ropes and ladders for the most part
delerated to trainees. There were no differences ob-
served as to experience, sex, or Douty, though the girls
and onder male cavers seemed to have better handwriting.
The best survey, however, came from Alice Cockey who
simply states "Michael carries everything for me."
Kiaja
Remember the time when Tuna,
Just as his trip looked ruined,
'Cause his brunton got wet,
But he said "we're not done yet",
For we'll map that cave later or soona!"
