BEACON CAVE
Bescon Cave is located near the city limits of
Bluefield in Mercer County, West Virginia. To be more
precise, the cave is found in the Miadle Ordivician
limestone of East River Mountain, close to the Virginia
line. The exact formation of limestone has yet to
be' determined.
The cave was originally mapped in August 1958
by R. Janke and others. However, I decided to remap
the cave last fall after it was brought to my attention
by one Fred Hines of Bluefield (formerly my roommate)
that he knew of a great deal of cave not the old map,
Several other people a?so informed me that the original
mapping was done by Brunton and pace, So, confident
that a good survey caild enlarge the cave considerably,
I undertook the task,
The cave itself consists of one long trunk channel
containing the main stream and at least four known
side strears, two of which may be the same stream,
Further surveying will decide this. The only passages
of any condiderable length are to be found alons one
of these streams. The cave trends along a line that
runs N 45 E with the side streams trending S 45 E.
Passage type in the cave is quite variable. The
main passage is fairly large on the average being
30' by 300 whch is filled with breakdown every 500'
to 600' for approximately a mile and a half, Passages
alone the side steams are quite variable, some of
which are of walking height and others crawling.
However, they are all wet and tight. These are the
passages that hold the greatest likelyhood of new pas-
sage as none of them are on the old map, although the
presence of two of them is noted. The streams are
known to contain at least a mile of passage. However,
the ends of ther streams have not been reached.
There are also parallel passages and passages of
different levels that are known to contain roughly
one half mile of cave, Passage beyond the downstream
pool contains approximately a thousand feet and the
cave's most impressive array of fornations, a great
deal of which has been vandalized,
The cave has two presently known entrances, Beacon
and Haines, The Beacon entrance is located on the
Applaachian Power righ of way, and consists of 2500
of alternatly crawling through and climbing down break-
down. In the winter access through this entrance is
