Recently, some secret documents stored in the
hallowed administrative halls of Burruss were made
public to the students, much to the distress of some
of our superiors, Here is the text of a telephone
conversation, printed completely without permission,
between the Supervisor of Buildings and Grounds and the
chairman of the VPI Grotto, Some of the names have
been witheld to protect the innocent and those names
stated are of individuals who are anything but innocent,
So, here it is,
CONVERSATION: CLASSIFIED

there was possibly an CAVE protruding its ugly head
in our midst. Fine, Then the filling operations can
begin as soon as...
Wait a minute, I mean that there's more likely

Possibly another Windy Houth,
Heavens! (pause) What's a Windy Houth?
That's a cave in West Virginia that is approaching
fourteen miles in length.
