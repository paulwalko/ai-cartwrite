From Fall Trog, 1968, by Steve Kark:
SWILL
01 Vigour grabs his spoon,
And Yeatts, he grabs a cip.
While Pablo's already chewin!,
Big Moose is throwing up.
A can of beans, a bottle of
beer,
A loaf of bread, a rabbit's
ear,
A jug of wine, a cricket's
leg,
A dash of salt, a turtle's
ess.
A slice of pork, a chuck of
ham,
A piece of cheese, a potted
lamb.
A cup of flour, a speckled
newt,
A pair of pants, a dirty
boot,
Someone says "it's good for
you,
Puts hair upon your chesti".
Yes, these are the priviledged
few,
who achieved the highest crest,
Somewhere in a quiet land,
Behind the farthest hill,
There sits this grubby little
band-
A'dying on their swill.
We gather round the old tin
pot,
At the bottom of the hill.
We cook it till it's boiling
hot,
And then we eat the swill.
