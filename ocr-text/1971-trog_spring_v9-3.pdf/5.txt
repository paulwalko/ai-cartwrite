Virginia; Pendleton County, West Virginia: and hopefully
the Central Kentucky Karst. These would be "sport" trips
and open to any interested and qualified caver,
Our opportunity for recognition can start NOW with
the NSS Convention. Let's demonstrate to all other
cavers that we have the caves, cavers and partiers, They
will leave the Convention with an impression of us. Let's
make it a good one.

EDITOR'S COLUMN
Annual Springtime elections of Grotto officers are
over and surprisingly, they went very smoothly this year.
Sure, we had the usual three hour meeting, but at least
we didn't argue for one hour of that about precedent and
whether or not candidates should stay or leave the room.
So, congratulations from the Trog Staff to the new of -
ficers, Dale and Pete, and keep up the good work to Liz
and Dennis,
With the 1971 NSS Convention coming up fast, we
went into the planning of this Trog with hopes for some-
thing special. We hoped and prayed for an abundance of
articles froin our many dedicated explorers and mappers
about all the most famous caves of the area. We approach-
ed the pestering of Dale for his President's column with
renewed vigor, We badgered the guys relentlessly to
think of "anything funny" so Bob could cartoon it. We
begged for articles - any articles, Then we sat back and
miserably waited, just as we'd waited the past three
quarters, Then, just as had happened the past three
quarters, a select few of you lovely cavers came through,
even with all the busy work scheduled in planning this
best ever, NSS Convention, Thank you for your support.
So here it is. I guess it's nothing "special" as
we'd hoped, Just another Tech Troglodyte, but composed
and concocted strictly by cavers for cavers.
And everybody, if you're coming to Convention,
have a great time, and if you're not, we hope you wish you
were! The 1971 NSS Convention promises to be really fun!
