did it encourage caving. The development of the brake-
bar method of rappeling and countless other improvements
in vertical caving were making vertical caving safer and
more easily learnable by the average member or trainee,
The safety committee got more and more incidents of ': ....
safety violation, in which the party involved often saw
nothing unsafe about his action -i.e. - an unauthorized
trip. The solution was the foundation of the present
trainee program, adopted about 1965. This system pre-
sumes that a member will use his or her own judgement
about leading a trip. Responsibility is emphasized,
Trainees may take out trips if they desire to caves they
can handle, although no hour-credit is given unless a
member is along. The results: an accident record that
is free of injuries and only very infrequently referring
to any trouble at all. The most unusual item in the
trouble listings is the fact that these trips usually
involved an experienced member, and the results were
never serious. Because of improvements in equipment
and techniques, once difficult caves now only present a
challenge, with one weekend trips now being done in an
afternoon. Hence the system that has now evolved seems
to be working, but only the future will tell us what
new developments in caving will appear and what steps
will be taken to neet them. But for the present, the
Grotto is in as good a condition as it ever was. If you
don't believe me, read the minutes, and you will find
that we have no monopoly on problems at all,

There is a caver named Douty,
Who at parties is said to be rowdy,
But give him one beer,
And he's down on his ear,
So goes the caver rowdy Bill Douty.
I'll tell you of Cheryl Jones,
Who among us is not too well known,
But she once went to Spence,
And came out from thence,
Laughing betwixt her moans.
There is a guy called Bobaloo,
Who was president of our motley crew,
When asked how he liked us,
He answered "no fuss",
"But I'd rather preside over a zoo."
