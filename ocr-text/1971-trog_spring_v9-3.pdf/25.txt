PAXTON'S CAVE
Paxton's Cave, owned by Burrus Paxton, is located in
the Newcastle Quad, near Jordon Mines in Alleghany County
of southwestern Virginia, It has a rather imposing en-
trance set down in an equally inposing sinkhole. A
stream flows down from the surrounding hillside directly
over and into the mouth of the cave, Mr. Paxton has set
up a drum to catch some of this water, complete with a
spicket, and although I won't guarantee how many cow
pastures the stream flows through, it does, nevertheless,
have good tasting water,
There is an entry in Douglas' book by Barbara Hagen
dated 1957 which indicates the presence of helictites and
high water marks found indicate "occassional flooding",
All is found in "Devonian Helderberg Limestone" with
"sandy material attesting to the proximity of sandstone
and limestone beds".
One will notice on entering this sinkhole a fallout
shelter sign with a rather small capacity numbered,
This indicates a small cave, but nothing could be further
from the truth, Roger Baroody, head of West Virginia
Cave Survey, undertook the mapping of Paxton's Cave as
a result of job he had in 1962 in which he was paid to
set up fallout Shelters in various caves. After being
lost for three hours in the 600 feet of the cave near the
entrances (for there are actually about three holes which
pose as one main entrance), Roger came to the conclusion
that he must have missed some of the cave,
So it took him till September, 1964 to finally re-
turn to Paxton's after hearing "stories of wild forma. ?
tions and crystals" from "agroup of cavers in Lexington"
who visited it. This second trip he made with one of
the Lexington people and Keith Evans, After again being
lost for two hours, they too found the formation room,
So impressed were they by these formations, that they
went on to find the First Discovery with its "Worm Gar-
den" of strange helictites,
In October, 1964 Roger again returned, this time
with a group from UVa Grotto, One person was sent to
push a crawl on the lower level from the First Discovery.
After 30 minutes "he came back babbling after opening up
the Second Discovery" and they proceeded to discover
still more of the extensive upper level maze.
Still later that year he returned with Walt and
Barbara Lipton and this time found the Christmas Roon,
(Contrary to popular belief that this name derives from
its white walls and passageways which look to be covered
with snow, this doscovery was made on Christmas Day; how
