SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
19
LOOKING BACKWARD
After wading through about 15 years worth of the VPI
Grotto's minutes and Constitution, one is completely im-
pressed by the ways in which the club has not changed.
The problems which we deem to be pressing were pressing
in 1943 and will probably continue to be in the forsee-
able future, with the club less than a year old, on
February 19, 1943, the problem of the club growing too
large was brought up for the first, but certainly not the
last, time,
My own particular interest is, of course, the train-
ing program of the club for new members, and how and why
it got to the point it has reached now. It has been an
interesting history, governed by the needs of the club
and the methods available to get the job done,
On April 23, 1943, the first stated new member re-
quirements were given in the minutes. These consisted
of filling out an application blank, going on two out
of three club trips, and being voted on by the club gov-
erning council after being discussed by the club. A
brief explanation of the club's structure at the time
will make this clearer. The club was governed by a
council elected every year. Apparently there were not
club votes on every matter as their are now, Club trips
were planned in advance, usually for a whole quarter
ahead, subject to change, of course, The club then went
on these trips "en mass". Most changes in the trainee
program can be traced to a change in caving conditions,
techniques, and methods of leading trips. By 1950
qualifications for members to lead trips to various
caves were set up, and certain caves were closed to
novices, This no doubt, was brought about by an in-
crease in vertical caving and its inherent dangers dur-
ing the era of the hoist and later, the body rappel. The
"club trip" was still the rule of the day.
During the 1950's the "club trip" system was re-
placed by the individual trip system, with responsible
leaders forming their own trips. This is a theory of
mine, relating to available information, for the minutes
for most of the 1950's are lacking, or missing entirely.
By the early 1960's however, the idea of authorized
trip leaders was being challenged by people taking out
"unauthorized" trips -1,e,-a caver taking out a trip
of his own without approval of a leader or the safety
committee. The "leadership system" answered with even
more stringent regulations, with an "A class" or verti-
cal leader, and a "B class" or horizontal leader classi-
fication being needed to lead vertical-horizontal, or
horizontal trips respectively. Needless to say, this
did not solve the problem of unauthorized trips, nor
