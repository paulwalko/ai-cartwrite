all the directions were backwards, and the map should
be redrawn upside down." They also surveyed lud River,
but not the crawl. The warning "FOOLS GO BACK" was in
there before this trip. (This quote appears at the
start of the climb out of the Andrews' Room, ) Solari's
barometer read 2100' at the entrance when they went in;
1860' at the bottom of the Grand Canyon Room (240'.
verticle distance for 1946 as compared with 220' for
1970-71. They have the Grand Canyon Room Drop as a
140' --no way--.) At the beginning of Idiot's Delight
1720' and 1700' at the end. When he brought it out,
the barometer read 2200" at the entrance.
Thiery and Griffin did the only flouresin tracing.
August 22, 1947 they put 200 grams in the stream 300
above the entrance at 6:30 pm. Aug. 23, 3:20-no sign
of floursin in Smoke Hole, Aug. 24- no sign of the
flouresin at Smoke Hole or Clover Hollow (the hollow,
not the cave.) Aug. 26. no luck anywhere,
April 29, 1949 Southworth led a party in to the
bottom of the Andrews' Room for sketch mapping and
tying in previous survey stations. This is the first
mention of the bosuns chair in the cave. (Slide 19
of the NSS'S "Caving Techniques" shows it being used
in 1946.) They sketched in the side leads between
the Gypsum Room and Library, and the passage from
Point Panic to the Garbage Room, Roy Charlton discov-
ered the passage from N i to 302 which is the Mud
River Crawl.
The first map was drawn in 1943, this one was
discovered to be 180 degrees off so it was revised
in 1948, More passage was found in the next few years,
but nothing was done until 1970 when the entire cave
was re-surveyed. To date, no new big passage has
been found, but everything was surveyed that was new,
as well as old,
The author wishes to make a more complete history
of the cave. If you have any information on Clover
Hollow Cave please send it to me in care of the Tech
Trog.

There once was a caver named Jim,
Some have climbed the Big Frog with hin,
When asked why he did it,
He bellowed "ah shit!",
"It was time for things to get grim".
