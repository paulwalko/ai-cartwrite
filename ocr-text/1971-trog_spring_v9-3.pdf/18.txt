A ROPE'S MEMOIRS
Let me introduce myself. My name is Gold' Line,
Perhaps you have heard of me, I'm the one you torture
as if you were depraved sadists. You have stepped on
me, thrown me down drops, tied me to trees and rocks
and pulled on me, dragged me through dirt and cold
water, and if that's not enough, you have coiled me,
tied me in knots and hung me on the wall. These are
not my biggest problems, though. The things that
really tick me off are those beings that you call
trainees, Clipping metal objects on me and using me
as a sliding board are bad enough, but these trainees

I feel as if I am in eternal hell sometimes with
the incidents that have happened to me. However, I
do not give up hope completely. Even though I have
been subjected to unbearable pain at times, I do not

two were lost through extreme pain and suffering,
but the remaining two were victorious for me.
Incident #1
This adventure turned out to be the most painful

me any warning whatsoever, He then let go of me for
some reason; I don't know why. That's when the torment
started. A shooting. buring pain went through me like
the fire of all hell was breaking out. I tensed up and
started to kink. That's what stopped him, thank heavens.
I don't think I could have taken much more.
Incident 2
This next adventure happened in a place called
Clover Hollow. It was a cold morning and there was
snow on the ground when you took me to this spot.
However, it would not stay that way for long as I
would soon find out. You had put me over the drop,
used me in the usual way and left me there. I finally
could get a little peace, or could I? It started
out as a small trickle but that didn't last for long.:
The water coming over the drop turned into a large
fall before I knew it. I was soaked in a matter of
