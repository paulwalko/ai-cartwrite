SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1971
Once upon a time
There was a wild, virgin maid
clothed in the deep blue of oceans,
fringed with white lace foam
and the rich green of grasses and foliage
Strong mountains she had,
with the white of snow
and ribbons of clear, curling, laughing streams
And her breath was fresh and sweet
once upon a time.
The maid became mother to many children
and let them take from her
that which they needed or wanted
for nourishment, protection, and adornment
And each time as the children became older
and grew teeth that bit too hard
the breast at which they fed,
she thrust them away
and, no longer in her favor
many languished and died.
But some of the children grew strong and smart and covetous
And took from her the blue of her oceans
and the green of her grass and foliage;
They smashed her mountains and muddied her streams
So sick they made the earth who mothered them,
that her breath became fouled,
and the nourishment she gave was poisoned
And when in final fury she died
she took them with her
And none were left to wonder at the enormity of the
destruction,
Or is that not the ending
and shall the story be:
But some of the children cherished her gifts
and grew wise in their desire to hold them.
And in a mighty wish for others who might
one day bear their blood
and know the warmth and beauty
they forged new knowledge
and learned a new restraint
And the earth who mothered them
was grateful
and paused in the path to death
and blossomed again.
