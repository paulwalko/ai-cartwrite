On this particular trip, Jones and Southworth
could not sleep, so they went exploring the passage
that the sleeping Room was in and found the Four Foot
Soda Straw. The newspapers that were taken in for
sleeping pads can still be read in the Sleeping Room,
the earliest one being August 4, 1943, The Richmond
Times Dispatch,
On October 3, 1943 there was another trip into
cave, but all there was was a mention of Idiot's
Delight,
The next trip according to the records to Clover
Hollow was April 1.5, 1944, when L.E. Andrews was lowered
in the room that bears his name, about 50' and insisted
it was a good 200" or more. (The Andrews' Room is the
only section named after a person, ) An interesting
letter was sent to the NSS Supplies Committee an April 23,
1944 asking permission to cut the 600' rope, that
turned out to be 1000' to 1200' long, into two parts,
This rope had been donated to Grotto for purposes of
exploration,
Rainey, Jefferies, Andrews and Bauer finally
did the Andrews Room on June 2, 19441, A Speleoplum-

own problems on the rope ladder. (It seems that they
used some of the extra rope to make a ladder);
November 10, 1946 was when it was reported by
E,F. Moore the latitude and longitude Were 37-21-26
and 80-27-38, respectively. This was gotten from a
topo and clover Hollow was made an official Giles

One of the most important discoveries was made.
on an overnight trip. (All Clover Hollow trips were
overnight for a long while; camping either at the
entrance or in the sleeping Room.) This trip was on
November 16-17, 1946. The party consisted of Dr.
Jackson, F, Solari, Yarus, Funkhouse, and Englert,
While Solari was experimenting with his barometer,
Moore and Jackson were surveying from station 23
(junction of the sewer passage and the tie off point
for the Andrews' Drop) they discovered "that the present
map of the cave was surveyed 180 degrees off so that
