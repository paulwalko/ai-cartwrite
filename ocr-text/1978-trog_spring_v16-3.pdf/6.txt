. There are many kinds of years. There are calendar years and
fiscal years and academic years. Here at VPI we don't care about
that sort of nonsense. All we care about are good years and great
-years. Well, unfortunately, it was only a good year this time.
But here you have it.iidt's called

All right then, let us consider what niakes it a good or great
year. Traditional have started this column out with a bit of
information concerning old A.H.'s throbbing heart: The romance of
the membership. Well, we got a few live ones this time. First
off, Richard Cooper (once perennial trainee, finally turned member)
has taken another bie step by going from perennial dirty old man
to hiappily wedded husband. It is a frightening story. Her name
is Debbie ivassa (now Cooper, of course) te met her just before
1alloween and she bewitched him. They were married March 18 in
Blacksburk. Robyn Ioud upheld tradition by setting sick on the way
to the wedding, but the ramifications of this event are even more
friehtening. Jim Bearden and Carol Goðla announced that they were
Eetting married July 1 in D.C. Also following this wave was Phil
Sica who proposed to his girl friend in the furnace room of the
VF v hall where Banquet party was hela. Not to be left out of things,
Dave Bell Erabbed the nearest available trainee and fell in love with
it (fortunately, it was a her). Her name is Jeannie Nye.
Other exciting news incluoes the fact that Lonnie Carter has
picked up a new (and larger) car. The corncob-mobile has been re-
placed with the cornhusker. john Mosely (once cornhole's roomate
in Pritchard) has made motions towards becoming the new rixon-Boy!
Lor Windle is flying again and warns the world to beware.
but all is not roses in the world. The VPI Grotto is going
to suffer some fairly heavy casualties this year. Carolyn Lewis
is departing to Oregon and Doug Olsen, Lor windle, Phil Sica,
Carol Godla, Donnie Carter, and üim Bearden are all graduating and
leaving, Bill Koerchner, though graduating, will stay on as a grad
student in order to supervise the conquest of (hopefully) much more
underground passage.
So it looks like old A.I. Cartwiight is ecing to have to make
it alone does it? Well, not completely. There are still plenty of
die hards still around pushing passages and such. Eill koerchner and
Paul Kirshman (known by many as the "kirch brothers"), have grunted
their way through toil aná trouble and have emerged with over three
niiles of passage in Spring rollow. They also claim it to be the deep-
est in the county (and are rumored to be digging for the world title).
Don Anderson has worked with Tom Vines and the Caver Certification
Program. Don's son, it is told, is going to pull some ears with the
connections he has made at the governor's ball to try to get the cave
conservation act into some semblence of order. Speaking of order', we
had flections this spring and wound up with a new crop of officers,
Ed Devine has secured the presidency except for this Spring kuarter
when Vice-President Chuck Shorten will preside. Notes will be taken
by pert, young Jeannie Nye acting as Secretary, and our gold will be
scrupulously hoarded by Treasurer/miser Richard Croft. For inaccurate
representations of them, see the first inside page.
