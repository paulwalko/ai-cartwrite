wue to a number of circunstances beyond
the control of the editor, the president was
unable to tive any insight into his upcoming
battle with apathy and all that. So it came
to pass that the editor approached me in the
underground haven that I call home that is
known to you as Clover riollow. The editor
appeared to be a reasonable chap even if he
kept addressing me as "Mein fuerher". Well,

I need to exhort all of you to take out the
potential members and bring them into my
domain so they can see my wonders and be

unce underground, i can dazzle them with my
antics and The Great Black God Chernobos can
impress them with his awe. cut we need to
éet them underground and only you can help.
so take them where we can get at them and
don't overwhelm theni with your great parties
and satherines (because somehow some people
det scared by too much greatness). Just.
bring them to me and I'll see to it that
we keep our underground in sood hands.
