Reflections

Its spring, 1978. And here is anotner Tech Troglodyte, vid
I hear someone say, "Biz weal"? maybe, but for me it is something
of a big deal. I know I didn't manage to get a songbook out, but
its hard to work unassisted without becoming demotivated. This is
also an important point because this is my last Trog. This is notice
of resienation for me as editor effective as soon as this issue is
Cispersed. I wish any successor luck.
This being entitled reflections, I feel entitled to make said
reilections. I stumbled my way through five years of college and
two degrees. Except for the first week of ny freshman year, I have
been a member of the club. I have been Parliamentarian for four years,
Program Committee Chairman for three years, Troe Editor for three
years, and Club Chaplain for two years. All these posts shall be
vacated this spring. I was also Secretary for one year and Vice-
President for two years. I also was the last caver in 3072 Pritchard.
I nicknamed Cornhole Carter (by accident), created the D.T.C., and
created Nazi Magoo I have been a Trainee of the Year and a Reckless
Driver. I have caved with the treat (myself), the near great (Don
Davison), and the not-so-great (Tuna).
But all horn-blowing aside, it has been a rich period in my
lite. I have met many interesting people, lerned how to handle
myself in curious situations, and had one hell of a good time doing
80. I know how ridiculous all this sentimental D.S. sounds, but I
do believe that in the cave of my heart the stalactites shall drip
tears at the thought of leaving
Concluding, though, I would like to admonish the club to take
care. The club is supposed to cave and it is therefore imperative
that cavers are in the club. This means either present members must
continue to cave or new cavers must be brought iri. Viewing the turn-
over rate wille have, hopefully both actions will be taken. if we (and
that means you-@12) can get our act together and not scare trainees
because of wild parties or emphasis on partying and keep then around
by active cavine (even trips to tough caves like smokehole or link's
would help). I know it is possible; it's just a question of doing
it. Again, sood luck.
