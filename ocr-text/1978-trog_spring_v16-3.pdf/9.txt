RACK ATTACK !
The intent of this article is to demons trate the basic principles of the rap-
pel tack and then to vive oine basis of comparison between different types of
racks. For those who do not wish to read through the whole article, Figure 4
gives a good sum:nary of the results,
For the first section, the rope is issued to be very flexible so that it has
no resistance to being bent. The next step is then to determine the friction
caused by running a rope over a round bar. This proves to be quite sinple, since
most besinninu statics houis derive this basic relation
T2/T2 = eau

where
T, = Tension in rope after rope goes over the bar.
T1 = Tension in rope before rope goes over the bar.
(T2 - T1 = friction)
a = Angle change over bar in radians.
= Coefficient of friction (sliding, not static, coefficient).
(sliding, not static, coefficient).
Notice that nowhere in the equation is the radius of the bar required, only
how far it goes around the bar in racians. So the same amount of friction would
be generated by a 90° bend over a 3/4" bar as would be generated by a 90° bend
over a 1" bar.
Next, the geometry of the rack must be taken into consideration. Since the
spacind of the bars can vary a great deal on a rack, a few simplifying 289umptions
are made:
) The rope leaving the rack and the rack are in line with each other,
The rope entering the rack and the rack are in line with each other
(Note: For comparison purposes, the angle that the rope enters the
racis will make no difference, since it will only add an additional
multiplication factor.),
The bars are evenly spaced along the rack,
The rope is flattened over the bar so that the distance from the center
line of the rope to the bar is approximately equal to 3/16",
The effect of wear arooves in the bars are neglected, and
U is constant,
