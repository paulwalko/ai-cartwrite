By 1972 it was apparent that the decline was serious. There were only around
ten cavers in Pritchard. Tuna was still in 3072, but kedder would replace Parks
in winter wuarter Cooke roomed with Slusarski, Stringfellow had Perkins, and Rolf
picked up Tom Calhoun, The cavers were in a state of siege, both with the R.A.'s
and with the jocks, Football' tickets were publicly burned and displayed, all sorts
or degrading comments were displayed on the doors. Perkins had the "Name the Nazi"
contest on his door. Due to this intense w√ºr, Strin
Due to this intense war, Stringfellow riceed up a fire alarm
in his room 3058, At the beginning of Thanksgiving break, before people were to be
vone, an R.A. came by checking on the rooms. Sure enough, the 3058 alarm went off.
Tuna, in 3072, heard it. The R.A. ran up the hall and begged him to turn it off,
Tuna pulled out his hearing aid, walked into 3058, and unplugged the alarm. But
Tuna was not a hero. This year the walls and stalls proliferated snide remarks
about him. He finally confronted someone with an accusation and got in well over
his head,..and the accused" was probably innocent. Tuna had other problems. One
night he locked himself out of his room and crawled out another window to try to
get back into his roon. Perkins set up lights and spotlighted Tuna in mid-traverse
from Lutz's room. All Tuna grunted was "Oh Goddamn" as he froze on the wall.
Elsewhere, Mark Slusarski roomed with Cooke in 3045. one night mark got sick
ang puked out the window. Unfortunately, he knocked Cooke's alarm clock out and he
threw up on that, too, as it dangled by its electric cord. Cooke was confused when
the alarm went off the next morning. Discovering his clocks position and its un-
sightly condition, he unplugged it and let it fall. They both graduated that wuart-
er and Denton requested to be put in their room to restore order. Perkins not only
got Denton in, but put Thor Brecht with him. One night Cheryl Jones ripped the
Trog off of Denton's door and venton,. suspecting neighbors, spray painted their
door. Having done nothing, they feared getting this misanthropoid upset, especially
since he used to carry a mace around with him. Winter of 73 also saw Loud return
to school and Pritchard. His roommate was awed by the fact that here was the man
whom the stalls were named after; the E.L.of E.L.M.T.in person. In Spring of '73
Stringfellow's mother got him a private phone. She had called up and got the old
"Pritchard abortion clinic--you rape 'em, we scrape 'em, etc" routine. The phone
was forthcoming.
In '73-74, the number of cavers dwindles to seven. Redder, wood, Stringfellow
and Mike Richardson held 3072 and 3058, They converted 3072 into a study lounge
and 3058 into their sleep quarters. Thor, Denton, and Calhoun also lived on the
3rd floor. The days of glory were over and the cavers struggled to hold on, Mike
Wolf took over 3072 in 74 and held it by himself. Lonnie Carter moved to 3075 and
Lor Windle revived the 3rd floor with Wolf in 3072. Retaliation was the order of
the day as many doors suffered when 3072 was marred, Nightly music kept irritated
residents up. "Convoy" blasted forth (with occasional "Green berets"). Lor Also
designed the "circuit-breaker breaker" to plunge the hall into darkness. Wolf left
in Spring 27 and Ed Devine moved in. Though quiet, he helped. But it was all to
no avail. In Spring of 1977 Lor Windle left 3072 and 3rd floor Pritchard after
fighting for two years. The last caver was zone, Pritchard had fallen.
Pritchard's defeat has to be viewed in the light of other events. In the late
60's-early 70's off campus palaces like the Airport koad House, The Dump, and the
Aux. Dump served as party spots. At first, this was Good, but then these places
became the mecting points and the dormis lost favor. More people moved off campus
to have some place to party and meet. In the mid "7006 VPI started a lottery
system to see if you could stay on campus. Once people could not be guaranteed to
stay in the dorms, the security and appeal were gone. So the dorms died out. It
was society that ended 3rd floor Pritchard as a way of caver life,

By 1975 the end was in sight. But
Lor Windle moved in and fought a bitter
delaying action against both the R.A, '8
and the residents. This lasted for two
years. After ten years 3072 went
down,
