POORLY, WITH PUKE IN MY

THE FIREPLACE. IT WAS

I FOUND OUT THAT THAT

Drink it. If you
are up after a party.
you obviously still
need a drink. If you
have revived after
the party then you
will need the drink
to recover.

The D.T.C. is still here.
Admittedly, we have not
been able to oversee all
drinking accidents in the
N.S.s. There have also
been several serious re-
ports of injuries within
the Virginia Region. It
is rumored that there is
an occassional puke near
VPI Grotto, too. So we
must all face up to the
facts that we are not the
image of perfection we
wished ourselves to be.
I'm close, but still may
have a fault or two,
work progresses slowly
with the D.T.C. One of
the biggest problems is
financial support. We
are working on a program
to educate novice party-
goers to tools that can
be found at home that
help with parties. This
is the Party Utilization
of Kitchen Equipment (or
"PUKA" as it were). We
8.lso need donations to the
Beer Analysis Research
Fund (called "BARF"). Any
contributions should be
mailed to us at the above
address. Also research
has ended on the ultimate
drinking vessel (see the
report on this page). It
should be noted that this
is a report and not an ad-
vertisement. As such, we
accept no responsibility
on the product itself.
What does it take to make a superior style of a
drinking vessel? It should be large, but light. It
should be well insulated to keep your drink at the
optimum temperature. It should be strong enough to
withstand rowdy drunks and rolling Toyotas. It must
be a comfortable grip to handle. In fact, two hand-
les would be ideal. The lip of the inue should be
contoureil to fit your lip. Now, after much research,
here is the Supermut, which helt all
This has definately got to be hailed as a true-to-
life miracle of technology. Made out of machined
aluminum, this mug is designed with an airspace in be-
tween inner and outer layers. This hollow construc-
tion gives lightweight characteristics to a large and
durable product. The hollow space also creates a
superior thermal , capacity, which means your liquid
will stay cooler longer. Twin handles are designed
to fit your grip and the edge will fit your lip. It
weighs only.9 pounds, but will hold 16 ounces. The
Superliug has been tested to 10,000 pounds axially and
5,000 pounds laterally. The handles have been tested
to 7,500 pounds. Finally, it has an adjustable flow
depending on the vertical axis angle. It is very
much worth it. Watch for future sales notices.
