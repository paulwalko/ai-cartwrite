(sung to "Pendulum" by Don Davison)
The first time that he saw the kee, the tapper was a-flowin',
Foam sat heavy on the beer, but his thirst was growin',
Filled up with a thirteen-ounce with brown and yellow foam;
Six point four type Miller trying to get him home.
Six point four type willer trying to get him home,
Drinking up that liquid near the beer keys stead,
He's drinking up the slack and now he's drunk off his head,
Alcohol slams his brain cells, inhibition's driven down,
Food goes out, Beer comes in, and dizzy all around,
Food goes out, Beer comes in, and dizzy all around,
Ten gallons still before him, that he cannot think,
Slowly putting down the beer--now piss, now pour, now drink,
From gulping down the gallons, to sipping down the suds;
Though slow and steady wins the race the liquor's in his blood.
Though slow and steady wins the race the liquor's in his blood,
He cannot count his drinks now, his concentration's poor,
Alcohol has robbed his body of the will to care for more,
His legs and arms hang leaden as he drinks that bev'rage down;
His mind it wavers feebly all around the town,
His mind it wavers feebly all around the town,
They tried to drink the kes with him, but he wouldn't let them near,
His gut was small, the keg was large, he could not drink that beer,
He puked there in between the toilet and the door;
You will not see hin drinking in your campingground no more.
You will not see hira drinking in your campingeround no more,
