Up to this point only the effect of friction caused by a normal force over
the brake bar has been considered. At this time perhaps a word or two on soine
other frictional types of forces is in order
If the bans are pushed too lose together, the rope is pinched between the
bars, causing the rope to bind at those points. With the possible exeption of
the two top bars, which sometimes have spacers anyhow, I don't believe that this
type of resistance will be very great. As the bars get closer together, the angle
of departure from the bar begins to approach a perpendicular andle to the rack
axis. This means that the force caused by the rope to slide the barg together
drops lower and lower. At the same time, the force that pushes the bar against
the rack fraide increases, which in turn increases the friction between the rack
frame and the bar. The result is to decrease the net force that could force the
bars into a pinching action.
Another very important frictional force is caused by the rope's resistance
to being bent. If the rope is very flexible and has zero resistance to being bent,
this force would be zero. In rope like new Bluewater II or Ill, which is very
flexible, I believe the resistance caused by the many bends would still be small,
To get a rough idea of how large this resistance is, clip a rack onto a piece of
rope and pull it through, being sure not to apply any tension on the rope feeding
into the rack. Of course with an old stiff piece of rope, this resistance can be
very large. I believe this bending resistance would be related to the sharpness
of bend (not how far it is bent, but what it's radius of curvature is) and number
of bends it nas to make in a rack, i.e., the sharper the bend and the more bends
there are, the more resistance would be produced, from this point of view, six
3/4" bars should Eenerate inore resistance than four 1" bars. But still, as flex-
ible as some of the braided ropes are, I believe that bending resistance should
be neglected in determining the capabilities of racks. If a stiff rope is en-
countered, bass can always be taken out or spaced to accommodate the additional
resistance.
It is not the object of this article to conclude which type of rack is best,
but only to give some basic idea of how they will compare in ability to generate
friction. But one thing can be easily observed, if five square cut bars with a
large offset are used to make a rack, this rack should have similar capabilities
as a standard six 3/4" bar rack. This new five-bar rack miunt possibly be less
susceptible to rope stiffness which would give smoother control on old rope that
has sections of variable stiffness.
