Once upon a time there existed the nation of Nazi Germany. It was a corrupt
dictatorship. It proclaimed that the "thousand year reich" was the ultimate form
of power in the world. But the thousand year reich lasted twelve years only.
In 1967 the dorm hall named Pritchard came into existence. It was corrupted
by masses of cavers. At its height of power, operating under the dominion of a
caver leadership, Pritchard was proclaimed to be the greatest entity in the world.
The strength of Pritchard lay in the mass community inhabiting the third floor.
Unfortunately, like its analogy to Nazi Germany, Pritchard was not invulnerable,
it lasted only ten years. This is a history of those years.
THE RISE AND PALL
OF THE 3RD FLOOR
Pritchard first opened in February of 1967 to handle the refugees from Campbell
Hall, which became a girls dorm, Russ Peterson was in the initial assault on the
3rd floor, taking 3083. In fall of '67 Pritchard was completed and Glen Davis and
ed worsan established headquarters in 3072. Bobby Lewis semi-lived in the room
also, even though he wasn't a student. Whened became president and Glen vice-
president this room began to become the focal point for activities. At this time
the club had a bulletin board at the end of one of the wings where they kept the
sign out sheet and other propaganda. Other residents included Danny Wright, Tom
Roehr, Tom Vigour, Carl Eddy, Don Laffoon and others. Barlow replaced morgan when
the latter graduated at the end of fall quarter, but the rool remained popular as
a center of activities, Alan Armstrong used 3072 as a departure point for his mid-
nicht runs to the Roanoke krispy Kreme Donut Shop. Sprint wuarter was quiet ce
Davis decided to flunk out with Armstrong. But Pritchard was now popular and the
influx of cavers gauranteed that there would come a reckoning.
Gary Moss replaced Glen Davis, As Moss relates it, he arrived before 3072 with
no key and no idea what to expect. When he knocked on the door, he heard a growl
and a thump as a body jumped out of a bunk. The door was thrown open and there
stood Barlow stark naked. loss says that he "almost got sick." Meanwhile, Frieders
became Resident Advisor (R.A.--police action) in 3040, joining Lauren Huffman as a
pro-caver R.A, Steve Hall lived in 3044, but n:oved in with Winston Harmon in 3047.
Bill Park lived with Dennis Webb (before he became a caver) and the two constantly
feuded. Their room was physically divided by a hanging sheet, Dennis complained
to the authorities and Frieders was notified to do something, Frieders wound up
setting Dennis interested in caving. Bill Park wound up flunking out. The year
saw many roofine expeditions from pike nayes and Don Laffoon's 6th floor room. The
two of them also regularly dropped water on Tom Roehr on the second floor. When
poured water and then water balloons failed to hit their tareet they resorted to
tiying water balloons to their rope and swinging them out and through Ton's window.
Bob Barlow tried to gas out Huffman on election night "68 by puttine carbide down
his own drain and plugeing it up. The attack failed and Barlow had to play plumber
to clear the air, Pete Schnaars replaced iMo66 Winter Wuarter. Guy Turenne also
appeared on the scene at this time, Spring Quarter was quiet but even more cavers
were signing up for 3rd floor Pritchard at this time.
By Fall Quarter of 1969 there were over fifteen cavers on 3rd floor alone. In
3072, Barlow and Schnaars; 3040, Frieders; Loud and Tirenne lived in the upper 3rd,
Craig Ellenfield and Peterson lived in 3083, Douty, Hogan, Laffoon, Webb and others
were around. It was at this stage in the developing saga of Pritchard that bon
Laffoon, primarily as a joke, gathered up petitions nominating Doug Perkins, Ed
Loud, and Bill Douty as vice-president, secretary, and treasurer, respectively, of
the Lower Pritchard House Council. The house council was an internal organization
of residents designed to provide open houses (visitation of the opposire sex), run
projects, make money, and keep activities active. Most people were fairly apathetic
about who ran the council and the vote would have been fairly even just owing to
luck. But the preponderance of cavers swung the tide. To everyone's amazement,
the cavers won. Fortunately, the President of the council thought like a caver or
could be persuaded to think like one, even though he wasn't a caver. Very quickly
the various committee Chairmanships were distributed out--to other cavers, of course
Peterson took charge of running the open house and who could be more perfect for
discipline than Bob Barlow, Since all officers, committee chairmen, and floor
representatives each had one vote, the control of the council by cavers was firm.
