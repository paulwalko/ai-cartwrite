The Vampire Bat can so fill up its digestive system that it has been estin-
ated that it can consume as much as thirty to forty percent of its own weight in
a single meal. To handle such a massive volume, especially of liquids, the Vam-
pire Bat has altered its urinary tract as well as the other alterations. One
means of handling the increased liquid is via diuresis. The Vampire Bat begins
diuresis two or three minutes after the feeding process starts and reaches a peak
several minutes after feeding has ended. The diuresis is extremely high reaching
a maximum output of four milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute.
This quantity is four times the maximum output found in laboratory rats. It is
an high indication of the specialization of the system since it is usually only
found in animals with high water intake. The variable urine flow is character-
istic of the Vampire Eat and is related to the need to increase extracellular
space.
Not only does the Vampire Bat have to contend with a large liquid diet, but
consumes nothing except blood, the diet is low in carbo-
hydrates and fat and extremely high in nitrogen content. This high nitrogen
level is balanced by the fact that the Vampire bat can concentrate its urea.
This concentration of urea is found to be higher in the Vampire Bat than in any
other mammal tested. The purpose for the urea is to minimize water loss through
urine and more rapidly and effectively reduce the nitrogen content. The Vampire
bat lives in an environment that is often not conducive to life-forms that re-
quire an intake of water on a regular basis. The Vampire Bat, therefore, lives
on a strict water budget. It does not compensate for this water need by drinking
and storing available free water, but rather restricts water lobs by having the
kidney concentrate the urine,
In conclusion, it can be clearly seen that the Vampire bat has developed a
number of specific characteristics in order to best adapt to its particular
needs and environment. These adaptations range from external factors such as
teeth, tongue, and lip to internal structure such as stomach and intestines to
internal functions such as diuresis and urea concentration. These factors have
combined to create a very effective digestive system that functions in an un-
friendly environnient, moreover, the system works on an all-liquid diet of
blood,
