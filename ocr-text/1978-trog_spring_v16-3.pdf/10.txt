To determine the angle change over the bars, the celationships in Figure i
were used, since the T, force of the bottom bar becomes the T force for the next
to the bottoin bar and so on, the relationship for the system is as follows:
(top bar)
To (bottom bar - eau + eazu +.... ganu U
In other words, add up all the angle changes for all the bars and treat that total
angle change as if it were around one bar. Figure 2 shows the Ol (angle change
around a bar) for 3/4" and 1" bars. Figure 3 shows total angle change for racks.

= Radius of bar
Sc = ivinimum clear distance between round bars--measured on axis between
center points of bars.
8 = dinimum clear distance between square bars--measured on axis parallel
to the rack.
= R + s/2
B = R + Sc/2
= R + effective radius of the rope = R + 3/16
= Arc Sin (offset/b) used for round bars
= Arc Tan (offset/A) used for square bars

angle change caused by exterior bar = OL
Angle change caused by interior bar = 204
