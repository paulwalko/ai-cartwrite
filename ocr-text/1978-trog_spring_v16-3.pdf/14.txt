Vampires!
Specialization in the Digestive
Tract of the Vampire Bat
The Vampire bat resides primarily in the warm climes of the world. As its
name from legend implies, the Vampire drinks the blood of its victim. The manner
in which this is accomplished, though, differs radically from legend. In fact,
in order to perform its own life-sustaining processes, the Vampire dat has
evolved characteristics different from the rest of the Chiroptera order. 'I shall
view the digestive system in the Vampire bat and show how it is specialized to
perform its functions.
The skull of the Vampire Bat is broad and the rostrum is greatly reduced in.
order to accomodate the large tooth structure. Of the twenty teeth the Vampire
Bat possJsses, only two have a distinct purpose. The two large upper incisors
are curved and sharp. They are used to gouge a wound in the skin. There is some
dispute as to what the canines do. One source said the large upper canines are
only used for defense. Another source stated that the upper canines were beveled
and were used to shave off layers of skin and hair with a sidewards motion of the
head. The two lower canines and the four lower incisors are much smaller than
their upper pairs and have no specific purpose. There are also ten nolars that
have no function in the blood-drinking bats and is considered to be of a vestig-
ial nature. This tooth structure is for the Desmodus rotundus, the common Vampire
Bat. Its two rarer relatives have a similar arrangement although possessing 22
and 26 teeth, respectively. The lower lip of the Vampire is cleft and the tongue
can be curled downward to form a tube-like arrangement. blood is primarily drawn
up into the mouth through tongue contractions similar to peristalsis. Other means
include capillary action and some lapping actions of the tongue. Additionally,
"As the blood flow lessens, the tip of the tongue is used gently to agitate and
thus stimulate the welling fount."3
The Vampire Bat has more than just teeth and tongue to aid him in seducing a
victim. There are anti-coagulant enzymes in the saliva. The Vampire has been
seen to lick its victim prior to biting him. This may be a method of applying
the anti-coagulant or it may just be a means of testing the victim's alertness.
It is also possible that the licking may apply an anesthetic enzyme, too. This
conjectured enzyme has not yet been proven to be produced by the Vampire Bat, but
it is suspected to be a possibility. Another possibility is a depilatory enzyme
designed to remove hair from the wound. Still more room for speculation is in
the purpose of the unique Buccal gland that produces a foul odor. It may be that
this odor keeps the victim in a sleeping state while the Vampire Bat finishes his
meal.
A normal Vampire Bat will drink 15-16 milliliters of blood per day. This can
be from one or several sources. An average meal will take about twenty minutes
and can fill the bat to a state where he can barely walk, much less fly. To
accommodate this large intake, the Vampire bat has altered its internal digestive
features as well as its exteraal ones. The primary digestive tract consists of
a T-shaped gastroesophagealduodenal junction and an elongated tubulat stomach.
The cardiac end of the stomach is drawn out into the shape of a long tube which
folds in onto itself in order to pack away in the body cavity. During feeding,
both the stomach and the intestines distend and stretch the skin until a gorged
Vampire Bat looks bloated and nearly spherical in shape. There is no appendix
or caecum off the intestines. Due to the shape of the Vampire bats stomach,
scientists believe that they may have a clue as to the evolutionary process that
has created the Vampire. "Such a modification of the stomach might easily have
been derived from the type soen in some of the fruit-oating bats in which the
cardiac end is already enlarged, so that one might suppose that the vampires were
first fruit juice eaters and later learned to puncture the skins of animals to
secure their juices,"4 One of the major functions of the T-junction digestive
tract in the Vampire Bat is that it is designed to facilitate several purposes
at once. During feeding, the blood flows down into the intestine and then over-
flows into the stomach. The stomach is the primary site for the absorption of
water into the system. Thus, the Vampire Bat can simultaneously handle the
immense liquid diet through both its stomach and its intestines.
