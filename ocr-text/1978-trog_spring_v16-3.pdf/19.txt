From 1969 to 1971, the obvious
high-water mark of Pritchard, all
the world was fair game, Perkins
instigated a right-wing policy
that definately reminded one of a
similar society.

Under the rule of the cavers, Pritchard flourished. Donuts were sold below
cost during exams, open house was always held. Peterson would assign cavers as
dorm monitors and no matter where they were they would sign forms stating that, to
their knowledge, all had gone well. Every so often someone would still get caught
doing something they weren't supposed to, though. It was then up to darlow to find
some excuse to have the charges dropped. Thus, Pritchard was the most trouble free
open house dorm on campus. The council did not encourage any athletic support, but
they did allow homecoming displays to be built by interested parties. The high
point came when the cavers were able to convince the non-cavers on the council of
the need for a mimeograph machine. So the obsolete mimeo Tom Roehr had bought some
time ago for the Tros was sold to the house council for $50. The cavers ruled in
Lower Pritchard with an iron hand and numerous policies reflected this. The
Council voted against amnesty for those who demonstrated against the Corps of
Cadets. A flier was put out in favor of the National Guard actions at Kent State.
But eventually the year ended in a party at the Greek's Celler with $270 worth of
food and drink. Sixty people attended (only one caver, though) and Bill Douty
left $5 in the treasury for the next year.
Other events that became memorable was the water battle where wike Hogan
pulled out his penis and chased someone (thought to be Guy Turenne) down the hall
with it, Ed Loud resigned from his position as secretary because he resigned from
school. The position was never filled because they couldn't find another caver to
take his place. Feeling low, Ed lead the drunken group to revelry at the Pizza
Hut. He lived with Turenne in 3044 and would stagger home every night. une night,
though, a crowd was hangine around as Ed tumbled into bed and passed out. A few
minutes later though, he jumped up, pinballed down the hall, and puked his guts
out in a bathroon stall. It used to be the Rocky Raccoon stall, but Ned Coleman
spray painted "another Ed Loud wiemorial Toilet" on the entrance door and a legend
was born. Soon the .L.M.T. name spread and became famous. Loud resigned but
would be haunted by his own legacy in years to come.
1970 was a year of conflict. Tuna Johnson and Pete Schnaars lived in 3072.
Perkins, Ned Coleman, Stoutenburgh, Webb, McClevey, Douty, Cooke, Lutz, Harmon,
Ellenfield, Hogan, Gross, Paga and Parrott all lived on the 3rd floor. There were
other cavers on other floors. But things were in turmoil. This was the last year
for Huffman, leaving the Pritchard Cavers at odds with the R.A.'s. The mimeo and
lack of money in the Council account led to charges of mismanagement and having
bought the mimeo for our own use. These charges were never substantiated (in fact,
Pritchard won the award for third best house council the year the cavers ran it).
About the only event of importance occurred in Spring of '71 when the freshme. were
signing up for dorm rooms in the T.V. lounge. A gang of cavers lead by Huffman and
Perkins marched in carrying clubs, chains, etc, Douty pulled the T.V. plug out and
Perkins stood on a chair to read a list of unacceptable people. From the Unamerican
Activities List!
Fall of 1971 showed the beginning of the decline. Tuna and Parks held 3072.
Strine fellow and Snelling, Webb and Rolf bicQuery, Coleman and Altman, Douty and
Cooke all held the 3rd floor. Tuna was earning a reputation as his third year in
Pritchard began. Stringfellow was to rival him in a short time. It was a quiet
year. Perkins remembers one fine night when he passed out in String & Snellings
rooli.. he awoke feeling poorly, saw what appeared to be a grate on the floor, and
threw up in it. To his amazement, the puke stayed there. It was only in the light
of day that he discovered that he had mis taken the lines of design on a rug for a
