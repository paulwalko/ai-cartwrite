Note for the case where there is no offset, the 1" bar has a larger Ou than
the 3/4" bar with no offset, which means it will generate more friction. But if
the 3/4" bar has a 1/16" offset, then its 04 becomes larger than the 04 for the
1" bar with no offset. Figure 3 shows clearly that even if the 1" bar generates
more friction on a one-to-one basis with the 3/4" bars, the four 1" bars would not
equal six 3/4" bars.
in an attempt to increase the annount of friction a rack using 1" bars can
generate, a few modifications were plotted in Figures 2,3, and 4. un the basis of
a 3/8" hole, leaving 1/8" metal at the bottom of the bar, a 3/16" offset is tried.
Note that a square cut and a round cut bar with offsets have different on for the
same spacing and offset. This is because the square cut bar must be spaced further
apart along the racis than the round bars to give the same minimum clear space.
This may not seem to be a fair way to compare round bars to the square cut
bars, but if round bars with offsets can be pushed closer together and still give
the same minimum clear distance to prevent pinching of the rope, then this is an
attribute that should be considered.
To give a feel for the magnitude of the frictional forces generated by the
different racks, Figure 4 was developed, in this graph, T, (tension in the rope
leaving the rack) is held constant at 200 pounds. The resultant 11 force is than
equivalent to the force required to maintain a cons tunt rato of rappol. The U

20% less than the static coefficient of friction in other colon engineering sys-
