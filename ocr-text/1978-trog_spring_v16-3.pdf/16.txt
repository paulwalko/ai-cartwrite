To the town of slacksburg drove a stranger one hot day.
Hardly spoke to folk's around him, didn't have too much to say.
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip.
The stranger there among them had a beer mug in his grip.
It was early in the morning when he drove into the town.
He came driving from the southside, slowly looking all around,
He's a drunkard who's been drinking, came a whisper from each lip
And he's here to do some chugging with the beer mug in his grip.
In this town there lived a drunkard by the name of Caver cd.
Though men tried to out drink him, all these men were gone and dead.
He was vicious and a puker and a punk of twenty-four,
And the notches on his beer mui numbered one and nineteen more.
Now the stranger started talking, made it plain to folks around,
nie was a west Virginia drinker, wouldn't be too long in town,
He came to out drink puker Loud, alive or maybe dead,
And he said it didn't matter, he was after Caver ud.
wasn't long before the story was relayed to Caver id,
But the drunkard didn't worry, men that tried before were dead.
Twenty men had tried to drink him down, twenty men had made a slip,
Twenty-one would be the drunkard with the beer mug in his trip.
The morning passed so quickly, it was time for them to meet.
It was twenty passed eleven when they walked out in the street.
Folks were watching from the windows, everybody held their breath,
They knew the redneck drunkard was about to meet his death,
There was a keg between them when they stopped to make their play,
And the swiftness of the stranger is still talked about today.
Caver Ed had not yet lift his mug, when a belch was heard to rip,
The drunk had chugged his first one down with the beer mug in his grip.
A look of fear crept in Ed's eye, but he hadn't started yet,
He chugged one down and plenty more, his match he had not met.
The nausea, the shakes, the sick, came from the rotgut lager.
Up came the puke, a dead cold sweat, and cd began to stagger.
It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round.
There before them in the puke and muck lay a body on the ground.
Oh, he might have gone on living but he made a fatal slip
when he tried to match the stranger with the beer mug in his erip.
