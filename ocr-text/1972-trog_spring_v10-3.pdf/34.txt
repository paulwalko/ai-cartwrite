crossectional area at the junction of the flat hook blade and
the horizontal beami Such strain multiplying factors directly
contribute to material failure when the lamp encounters caving
obstacles. Similar poor design exists at the junction of the
beam and the bolting plate. The bracket also holds the lamp much
higher up and farther out than the brass model, increasing both
it's collision vulnerability and the bearer's neck strain,
The brass. lamp bracket could absorb tremendous blows and re-
quired... simple rebending for repair. The 'lamp was also held
much closer and lower than the plastic model: The above ment-
ioned problems are fundamental design defects and should not
have been permitted.
FIX H: The old stamping machine could easily have been
used to produce a brass bracket which could be superior to the
plas tic one and only slightly different from the old design. If
you want to make your own, try these two designs, the choice
depending of the materials available to you:
Design #1: For bendable materials such as brass.
(Figure 2) Obtain a piece about 1 5/8" wide, 2 3/4" long and
no more than 1/16" thick. Scratch the pattern of Figure 2 on
the surface, and chew out the design with a hacksaw or nibbler.
Drill the bolt holes, and cut the two slots to allow the bending
of tension curves, Round the corners, and smooth the edges.
Bend the bracket around a 1/4" drill or rod, using the wide area
for greater strength, to slightly more than 180 degrees to tilt
the lamp downwards. The "acorn" nuts may be replaced with
regular hexnuts to increase the bracket clearance,
Design #2: For brittle materials such as heavy aluminum.
(Figure 3) Obtain a piece about. I 5/8" wide, 2" long and no .
more than 1/16" thick. Scratch the pattern of Figure 3 on the
surface, and hacksaw the shape. Drill the two bolt holes, round
the corners, and smooth the edges. A slight bend will point
the lamp slightly downwards,
ITEM I: There is another hazard with the new lamp:
the unexpected disingtegration of the lamp when the front brass
bushing melts out. This "meltout" results in the loss of the
entire tip and reflector assembly, Also, the freed acetylene gas
represents both explosive and physiological dangers. "Meltout."
most frequently occurs when the wind protector is attached to
shield the base of the flame. The flame passes through the 1/4"
diameter hole, and, by proximity and contact with the protector,
it supplies' heat to the entire reflector assembly. Heat
losses by convection and radiation from the shiny reflector
are inadequate, consequently, most of the heat is conducted into
the plastic, melting it in as short as a matter of seconds.
Unfortunately, Justrite encourages the use of the wind protector
supplying them with each lamp, and they fail to warn of the :
possibility of "meltout". It should also be noted that"meltout"
can occur under certain conditions without the protector, such
as being relatively motionless, and pointed downward to capture
