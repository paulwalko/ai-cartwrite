BETTER ILLUMINATION FROM YOUR CARBIDE LAMP
The most important piece of equipment to a caver is his
source of light, One source is the acetylene l√°mp. Most cavers
are aware of the versatility of the carbide lamp. Its intense
white flame is projected by the reflector into the void ahead.
Let's look at the nature and use of this lamp and see how one
might be able to see more of the world that lays before him.
First, assume that the flame length and quality are such to
give the optimum illumination. Also assume that these parameters
do not vary with the particular configuration of the lamp. Two
variables now exist for the lamp - the nature of the reflector
and the position of the lamp with respect to the object(s) (or
void) to which one is looking. Again we assume that the flame
lies on the symmetric axis through the reflector.
Most reflectors obtained today are of a parabolic nature with a
highly polished, chrome-plated surface. They range in size from:
a 2 inch to a 7 inch diameter, The 2 inch one throws a broad,
diffused light while the 7 inch reflector projects a powerful
beam of light. Most cavers I've met use the intermediate size.
This 4 inch size combines advantages of both, Reflectors used
today are almost entirely chrome-plated. The 'brass and tin
reflectors phased out long ago with the passing of Guy's Dropper,
Auto lite, etc. So it seems the standard of today is the 4 inch
chrome-plated reflector available from Justrite,
Next, consider the placement of the lamp. Again the standard
seems to be sporting a flat clip model attached to some sort of
protective head gear. This arrangement leaves the hands free
but the attachment to the hard hat definitely leaves much to be
desired. At best the lamp is aligned along an axis parallel to
the hard hat. This is fine when looking at objects directly in
front but does little to illuminate the 100 feet of open passage
that may exist or the pitfalls that lie directly at your feet,
Lamp clips have been bent by the constarit removal and replacement
of the lamp on the helmet to such a degree as to be also lighting
the ceiling while the caver picks his way across uns table break-
down. If one tilts his helmet (and thus his lamp) downward, he
often finds his vision completely blocked by the brim of his
helmet. So, we have posed some problems, Let's look at some
solutions,
The most obvious foresight is to assure that you have a clean
and polished reflector. A dirty or tarnished reflector is no good
whatever the size, shape or material. Many cleaning agents are
readily available. I've used Brasso, silver cleaner, and tooth-
paste - all with success. In general., you want to avoid cleansers
that depend on heavy scouring action and especially steal wool,
