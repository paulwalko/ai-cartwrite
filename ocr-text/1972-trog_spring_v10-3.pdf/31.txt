and the setting was maintained by the small stamped detents on
the lamp top. With the old lever, determination of the setting
by touch was easier than with the new ambiguous stem. The
rounded-hexagon stem knob is also relatively slippery, even
when dry. Furthermore, if the stem is loose, it can easily lose
it's setting when bumped.
FIX A: Cut or file a large notch on one side of the stem
knob and several grooves on the other points. (See Figure 1)
These will provide improved friction, and the notch aids setting
by touch. If the stem turns too easily, chew the threads a bit
with pliers.
ITEM B; The water fill plug, although easier to grip
than the stem, is easily lost. The old water door was secured
from loss and was simpler to open. It also captured and returned
most water expelled from the water tank. The new plug tends to
spill water which collect's in it's open-topped recess. Note
that in many new lamps, the plug must be screwed in fully to
allow necessary ventilation through the two small holes in the
plug sides. Otherwise, the lamp may chug, die or overpressur-
ize (BANGI)
FIX B: Punch a hole in the top edge of the plug, and
tie it to the stem, with a short string, to prevent loss.
Punch two small holes in the bottom surface of the plug to insure
ventilation.
ITEM C; The new neoprene O-ring gasket is an improve-
ment over the old flat gasket, The O-ring should provide a more
resilient seal, unless the sealing surfaces are badly mangled.
Although this O-ring does not fit the old brass lamp, a smaller
one should be a desirable modification,
ITEM D: The new structural design of the filter and
the gas path through the front brass bushing appears inherently
inferior to the brass lamp design. The old design maintained
continual protection of the gas path behind the tip by the felt
filter, which removed particles and droplets from the acetylene,
The gas tube was also water-cooled, and any condensation in the
tube normally descended into the felt, minimising buildup which
could block the tip hole and kill the flame. The new design
has a simple horizontal gas path and a nonabsorbent plastic
"filter" which has an overly large cellular structure. These
factors permit contamination of the gas path, and subsequent tip
blockage, by both particles and condensed fluids. To compound
this problem, the path is exposed, accumalating more material,
each time the top is removed for carbide reloading. As another
significant hazard, the combination of faulty plug ventilation and
frequent tip blockage can lead to excessive pressures within the
lamp, as the carbide will continue to produce acetylene with any
water remaining in the bottom. This may explain several reports
