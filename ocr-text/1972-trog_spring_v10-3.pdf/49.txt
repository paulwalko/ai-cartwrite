THE STORY OF WILBURN VALLEY CAVE
In the shade of the lofty Pearisburg Mountain there
are caves which go by such names as Raspberry Hollow, Hodges
and Starnes and one little cave called Wilburn Valley Cave,
Once a party of adventure-seeking cavers entered this dark and
then unknown cavern only to be stopped by a deep,evil lurking
pit. Being prepared for such an outcome, they pulled out their
magnificent 120 foot cable ladder and and attempted to conquer
the drop. But, alas, even their miraculous ladder fell short of
the bottom by at least 60 feet. The overpowering Pit forced them
to turn back full of amazement and wonder and new thoughts to
tell the world
Well, so goes the legend of Wilburn Valley Cave, Driven
by this tale, a party, consisting of Bill Donkin, Scott McDon-
ald and Ed Brenner of Pearisburg and VPI cavers. 'MikeFFrieders,
old-timer Bob Simons and myself decided to took into this cave.
The cave itself is located in Wilburn Valley in a gully-sinkhole
system east of Raspberry Hollow Cave and about a quarter of a
mile from the road. On speaking with the owner's son, Carson
Hodge, we got very accurate directions to the cave and back to
the pit. He also mentioned that a man from Radford once. entered
the cave, and declared it too dangerous because of its unstable
state. What, us worry?
AS We worked our way back the pit, we encountered an
abundance of cave resoures such as dripping and running water,
mud, crickets and spiders. The Rain Room accurately describes
the major feature in one particular section of the entrance
passage, adding to the discomfort of the tight crawls, It should
be pointed out that supports a great abundance of spiders, crick--
ets and some salemanders. Parts of the passage are well decor-
ated with flowstone, draperies and other formations,
After 300 feet of tortuous passage we and all our
gear reached the top of the pit. The stream we had been follow-
ing veered to the left and down and entered the pit a little
lower down the side, Loose and potentially dangerous break-
down lies at the pit's rim at the point we had to rappel. The
only place else would be directly in the waterfall. Scott was
the first to go down the virgin drop which was later named
Great Scott Pit. The drop itself is 105 feet deep and the well,
20 by 30, bells slightly, making it a rather nice free-fall,
excellant for rappeling and prussiking. The only troublesome
part is the layer of very loose and wet mud clinging about
ten feet down from the rim. It makes a terrific SPLAT when it
hits bottom, but makes it hazardous for those below.
