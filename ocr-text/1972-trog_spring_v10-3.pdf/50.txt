SPRING --
TECH TROGLODYTE
1972
At the bottom of the pit, in all its muddy glory, there
were virgin leads going in two different directions. We chose
"the passage into which the stream flowed, and soon plit into two
groups. One group went to a higher level, but the group I was
with continued to follow the stream. The entire stream passage
was overlain by moist thick mud and wood de cis, suggesting occa-
sional flooding. The passage twisted at sharp angles, probably
following the joint system of the rock. We pursued the stream
until it sank under a wall. The other group discovered a few
large rooms and found many more leads.
A second trip gathered the following weekend to push the
leads and start mapping. The exploration party, which was led by
Bill Donkin and included Janet Queisser, Scot McDonald and Ed
Brenner, went to the upper level to push the leads, A mapping
crew consisting of Steve Hall taking notes, Bill Park reading
brunton and myself on lead tape,, mapped the stream passage. We
found a couple of leads, but didn't check them. We did, however,
manage to push the crawlway at the end and found more passage on
the other side, It opened to a room containing breakdown which
was completely covered by moist dirt. At the end of the room
iay a lot of small breakdown covered with wet mud, possibly in-
dicative of a sinkhole above, We mapped 450' from the pit to the
end of the stream passage. All the leads pushed by the explor-
ation crew ended in mud sumps. With time as a major factor, we
left.
The cave is by no means finished. There are many leads
still unchecked, and there will be more tales to tell as the ad-
venturous seek to conquor Wilburn Valley Cave, mysteriously hid-
den until now.
