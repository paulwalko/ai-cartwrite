ON CLOSING OF A CAVE
This is a report on why a cave was closed and how
this closing may have been prevented.
Beacon Cave is located in Bluefield, West Virginia,
(Mercer County). For many years it was known as a small cave, a
measly 150 feet. In 1959 members of the VPI Grotto undertook
the project of mapping it. A small hole through the break-
down was pushed and it opened up to the trunk channel, Two
weekends of extensive mapping revealed 12,500 feet of passage and
a second entrance. For reasons unknown, exploration and survey-
ing ceased with five major leads unchecked.
Interest in Beacon Cave was revived in 1970, as the
unchecked leads had been pushed by local cavers and several thou-
sand feet more discovered and no end was in sight. The project
of remapping the cave has produced 2000 additional feet, none
of which was on the old map.
Beacon Cave is unique for several reasons. Of the thou-
sands of caves in Virginia and West Virginia, Beacon is the only
one known to cross under the state line, John Holsinger has re-
quested specimens of the cave's isopods and amphipods to det-
ermine if they are unique species. A bat colony numbering in
the hundreds is also in the cave, which is unusual to this
particular area. In a county which contains caves 1000 feet
or less, Beacon Cave may extend co over 20,000 feet.
In the years between 1959 and 1970, Beacon Cave saw
an increased amount of traffic, Due to local political moves,
the cave is now located within the city limits of Bluefield.
Readily accessible, it became a favorite with the local "cavers",
and several times rescues' were needed to remove the lost ex-
plorers. The heavy traffic began in 1967 as the downstream
pool was crossed for the first;time revealing the cave's only
formation room. Within three years it was destroyed.
The events that directly and finally led to Beacon
Cave's closing occured during the summer of 1971. These incidents
went on without any knowledge to the Grotto or the rest of the
Caving world. It was learned on the first mapping trip of:
Fall Quarter that the cave was to be bulldozed shut in one week.
Earlier that summer two young teen-age heros armed with
candles and a gallon of wine entered the cave. Five hundred
feet later and after finishing the wine, they lost their light and
waited for a rescue, which arrived the next day.
Late in August another youngster with some adventur-
ous companions went in. The boy dislodged some loose break-
down which fell on his chest, knocking him urzongious.. Again
the town rescue squad was called in.
