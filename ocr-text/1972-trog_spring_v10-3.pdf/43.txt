What treacherous squeeze may lie ahead?
What slippery: climb may be encountered?
what danger awaits this explorer of the mind
As realization becomes a horrible nightmare?
The real becomes a fantasy as horror and truth are one .
False images are shattered as rocks are chipped away
To reveal virgin passage that otherwise would be lost.
The beauty of unknown is soon enjoyed as light gives form to chaos
But once experienced the unknown vanishes and with it a lessened
beauty.
A virgin lead, a virgin thought
Both will never be the same
So there is a loss that must be considered
Before determining what is gained.
The passage goes, understanding continues
As exploration begins.
Excitement builds as one proceeds
Alone to discover truth.
Deeper into the depths of self
Till the only light is one's own
The only sound is the caver's steps
As he continues to climb and crawl.
Moving still deeper into himself
And farther from the known.
Yet this mysterious realm
Will soon yield to search
And unknown made known
As mystery is solved.
The lamp grows dim as the journey is continued
And plans must be made to renew the sight.
A spot is found in this unknown region
And the necessary preparations made,
The lamp goes out as the waste is dumped
And new components are added.
Carefully the operations are performed
