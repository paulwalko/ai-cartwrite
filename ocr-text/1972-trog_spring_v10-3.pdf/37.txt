hot convection currents with the reflector - "meltout" can
occur within minutes. There are times, however, when the pro-
ector can be valuable, such as in stiff breezes or when it cap-
tures a tip dislodged by shock.
FIX I; ... Do not use the wind protector with the plastic
lamp unless it is absolutely necessary, for it risks destruction
of the lamp. If it is used, the reflector should be touched
frequently to detect overheating. Paint the reflector rear
surface a flat black to increase it's heat radiation capabil-
ities. Enlarge the protector hole to reduce the probability
of flame contact - an increase to 5/16" diameter will provide
50% more aperature area and will still catch loose tips.
Should "meltout" occur, shut off the lamp water supply and
attempt to avoid acetylere concentrations. Incidently, it should
be possible to restore a melted out bushing, with dubious
value and some difficulty, by reheating or glueing,
In review, it is apparent that the new plastic carbide
lamp is somewhat less than optimum, or even desirable. The
device suffers from engineering iyopia and mismanaged technc-,
logy. Hazards such as "meltout", ease of breakage and possible
explosion constitute deterrents to underground use which Cavers
cannot ignore, ..
How is Justrite presenting their product? The following
paragraphs are quoted from a Justrite form letter, dated Jan. 72,
which was apparently intended for dealers:
For the past two years we have been engaged in the devel-
opment, preliminary production and testing of Carbide
Lamps molded in polyethylener and polypropylene. These
lamps now replace the brass and steel lamps we have
made in the past.'
We know that you will find thse new lamps to be substan-
tial improvements over Carbide Lamps made in the past,
and that you can look forward to a much larger market
for Carbide Lamps as a result of thse changes,
It is suspected that Cavers and dealers will remain unconvinced.
Cavers have probably been Justrite's most faithful
group of customers, Why has Justrite made this change and risk
the alienation of the Caving Clan? First, consider that the
carbide lamp has remained essentially unchanged for decades,
It can be shown that a company without significant domestic
competion, and with a readily marketable product, is unlikely
to change either its designs or methods. This conservative
attitude may be forcibly changed by the pressure of rising pro-
duction costs and other factors. The costs of both labor and
brass have climbed greatly in recent years. However, before
significant changes are implemented, it is wise to conduct
