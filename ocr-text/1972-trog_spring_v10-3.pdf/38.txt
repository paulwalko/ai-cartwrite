a market survey to determine product desirability. Further-
more,' a strict evaluation must be performed to appraise product
suitability. Evidently, neither have been properly executed,
and the product failure may cost Justrite a major portion of
it's market,
What could Justrite do now, assuming that they would
be sincerely interested in improving their product and re-es-
tablishing themselves before Cavers? An interview of the
Caving Fraternity, perhaps by means of questionnaires circulated
among members of existing groups, could lead to the development
of a winner - the first lamp for Cavers and designed by Cavers.
Meanwhile, back at the plant, the company would do well to supply
on request, free replacement metal brackets such as Design #1.
They should also be willing to redeem their dere tive plastic
lamps for the original purchase price.
More importantly, what can Cavers do in this situation?
Pass the word, and don't buy plastic lamps. If one has failed,
take it back to the dealer with a polite demand for full refund
of the price. Warn him of the hazards involved, and encourage
him to return the lamps, demanding full refund, with an explan-
ation of refusal. If enough reaction is generated, and lamps
returned, the manufacturer may be persuaded to correct himself.
Also, check out all your local sports and hardware stores for
residual stocks of brass lamps. If you locate some, spread the
word and help your grubby buddies. . Assemble quantity orders
for discourits (some dealers may sell discontinued products at
reduced prices), and spread the supply. ..
Where can one find brass lamps? There are two types
worth seeking, one of which is the rapidly vanishing: Justrite
model. The other is the Premier, made in England and imported
in increasing numbers. It should be noted that many owners of
the Premier lamp believe that it equals or surpasses the domestic
product. Although there are undoubtably other sources, the
following entries have been personally checked as indicated in
