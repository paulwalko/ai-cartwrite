The life line to freedom
Yet the exit from paradise.
The heart wishes to return to the outside world
But the mind desires the solitude of the self,
With mixed emotions the rope is climbed
And the journey through the inner self is ended.
As the entrance of the cave is left
The mind recalls the experience of the inner self
And the exploration is continued,
Striving always to discover truth.
