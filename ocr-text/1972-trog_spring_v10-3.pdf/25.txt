SOME NOTES ON TIE-IN
The clove hitch is often used for tying-in to trees
because of its high efficiency when compared with the bowline.
Normally, the hitch is backed up with a bowline tied to another
tree as in Method 1. Unfortunately, this usuallly creates a'
low trip cord, near the edge of a drop, waiting for some in---
attentivı caver to stumble over.

Method 2 requires less rope than Method l and also
eliminates the hazard mention above. The bowline should kang
just loose enough so that no bend is produced in the working
portion of the rope,
