PRESIDENT'S COLUMN
. One of my Geology Lab students asked me the other day if I
had any cave formations at home that I had collected, Somewhat
amazed, I replied, "But of course not. That's totally contrary
to our club's conservation policies."..
"But I wouldn't think that it would hurt just to break a
few off the walls."
"Listen fella, you don't even take a broken one from the
floor unless it's of some scientific interest and can be utilized
for those purposes."
Still puzzled at his naive attitude, I explained to him
about cave conservation, even going so far as to repeat the old
adage that - if everyone took a stalactite there would be none ;
left for anyone to see, Now the guy wasn't being arrogant and
he wasn't dense, He just simply hadn't thought about it.
The trouble is that a lot of people like this guy go caving,
and when those that just don't care are added to them, the result
is the pathetic destruction of caves, like New River, that bear
grim witness to their negligence, And what bothers me just as
much is the tremendous number of people outside our club that do
go caving now, many of whom do not subscribe to good caving prac-
tices. We, as a grotto, adhere to the caving principles consti-
tuted by the N.S.S. but we have no direct control over these out-
side cavers, They can ruin the beauty of a cave with their van-
dalism, cause a cave to be closed by disrespect for an owner's
property, or create bad publicity and endanger themselves and
others through reckless safety techniques. As you may have al-
ready heard, we are essentially suffering from an over-population
problem in caving, and the practices of these "outsiders" should
be of a major concern to our grotto.
At this point you probably wonder what the heck we can do,
since it seems like we're doomed to a position of helpless frus-
tration. However, there are some measures that we can take to
help correct this detriment to caving.
We can start right here, within the club itself, Last fall
was a prime example of the exact thing that we do not want to
happen. Judging from the number of trainees who paid dues, we
turned on a lot of people to caving but they were turned off to
the Cave Club, These grotto drop-outs that still go caving are
no longer under the influence of the conservation-minded cr tech-
incally experienced members of our group. Due to the high per-
centage of students on this campus that go caving, we don't need
to interest people in caving, but let's turn the cavers on to the
grotto. We can make the club more attractive by stressing the
