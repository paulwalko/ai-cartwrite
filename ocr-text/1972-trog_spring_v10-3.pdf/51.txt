..... Pages 37, 62, and 77 of the Songbook came out really bad.
the first time around in all of them. The stencils have been
recut and if you'd like improved pages; just ask for them. Al√≥t
of people have pulled the staples and 3.-Hole punched the books
so they lie flat in a notebook, so you can have your hands
free for strumming, drinking.: or messing around with your
neighbor, Just watch out for your comrads who get their grins
from rearranging the pages upside down and backwards and think
it's really: cute!
iStill on the subject of songbooks - we've had orders for
them from all sorts of places and we've also sending as many as
we can out to White Salmon Convention (Go West in '72!).
..... If you muscians have found some of our chords not quite right
you can either blame it on typing errors or the fact that when
we sing, it usually is so off key thet it doesn't matter anyway!
..... This quarter for the first time at VPI Cartography was
taught in the Fundamentals of Engineering Dept. Quite a large
number of cavers enrolled, but were somewhat disappointed in the
content. Everyone sort of expected to be doing actual map draft-
ing, but the course turned out to be learning how to read maps,
It was nonetheless rather interesting and even time was taken
to describe cave maps and Bill Park made a good pitch for caving;
Hopefully some outside interest can be sparked in what wehre
trying to do.
..... Down in Cumberland Gap National Park where we stayed for the
Spring Project, turned out to be nothing more than a big morel
patch! If you're not up on your edible wild mushrooms , morels
are considered the most delicious of the ones to be found in
this part of the world. So if you're out ridge walking between
April 20 and May 10, keep your eyes open.
..... Did you know that to go into the mushroom business all
you need is some luck, a cave and lots of high-grade horse
man ure? I don't know about the first two, but we sure have alot
of the latter flying around!
.....For the closed cave list - Five Meters Down Cave (Blacks-
burg Quad) has been closed again. The cave is located on
Campus across the street form the Wesley Foundation. The cave
mapped last fall with total passage length of 8 ft.with cave life
consisting of rats (Rattus rattus). The map rest in the private
files of W.C. Douty for scientific purposes only (No sport cavers,
please!) The Caving World surely loses big with its closing,
The name will aid in finding the entrance, five parking meters
down from the corner of Roanoke Street,
