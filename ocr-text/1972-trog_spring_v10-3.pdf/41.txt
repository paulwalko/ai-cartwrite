"EXPLORING THE CAVE OF THE INNER SELF"
Excitement is felt as one approaches
The entrance to the unknown.
A dark hole that awaits the curious mind,
Inviting yet forboding in its mysterious cloak of black.
Brave person or perhaps fool to search this unknown realm.
The mind soars with fleeting fantasies of dangers that never could
cccur.
The flesh is fearful to cross the mark and journey through the
inner self.
This cavern dark and unknown can surely hold truth of mind
Just as one can find a light in discovering the inner self.
The rope is rigged, the life line secured
To journey forth in search.
The depth unknown the peril unclear
The brave will now begin.
Yet one is not alone in this trip into the mind,
For there are friends of similar plight
Who will journey with you there.
But they don't see what your eyes see
And they won't see your inner self
For their journey is another cave
Into another self.
The brake bars hold the precious cord
And slow the life force's path
Till carefully the caver glides
Maintaining steady control
As the harshness of nature's beauty is illuminated by his path.
A fragile light is all the force that separates known from unknown
A single desire to search for truth is what forces one to continue .
A point is reached where contact is made
But there will be no stopping here
For dee per adventure awaits this soul,
