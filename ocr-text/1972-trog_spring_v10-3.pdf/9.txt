HIGGENBOTHAM'S #3
The Group, which consisted of Janet Queisser, Rolf
McQueary, Steve Hall and Bob Amundson, left Blacksburg, the arm-
pit of Southwest Virginia, early on a typical Wednesday morning
in March. Good weather smiled down upon them: rain, cold and
a forecast of sleet. The destination was Higgenbotham's #2,
Virginia's finest and most perfect cave.
The drive down was une ventful, stopping twice for
repairs and only six times to let Janet relieve herself in her
excitement of finally fielding a trip to Hig. Following dark
and ominous clouds, they found their way to the most haunted
part of Thompson Valley. While talking to the Pucketts, they
learned of the many local legends concerning the cave. A lost
collie and a blue-striped hat which had been thrown down the
drop, were washed out of Maiden Springs, a resurgence down the
valley. After Bob cleaned his breakfast off of their new color
TV, they tiptoed through the cowpies to the awesome, yawning
chasm. But alas, water was boiling into the entrance at a
voluptuous rate!
They started to skip back to the car, when Janet raised
her dejected head and exclaimed, "Ah HAH! We can check out
that obscure local spring on yonder slight rise." Which turned
out to be a 60Â° slope, So they fanned out in a search and destroy
pattern and promptly located three ground hog holes, four snake
pits and a garbage dump. As they turned exhaustingly to leave,
Janet cried out, "This hole looks as if it has loose boulders
around it!"
After moving six tons of number nine dolomite, access
was gained to a crawlway leading into the ne thermost parts
of the hill. After ten feet, it opened up into huge passage,
typical of the Great Savannah. Steve Hall, geologist emeritus,
exclaimed over the brightly colored trichnic speleothems. The
passage wound sinuously ever downward requiring expert climbing
and skillful chimneying to negotiate it. They were astounded
by the amount and type of debris: old truck tires, old trucks,
boards, rusty nails and even a small sledge hammer. Finally,
Steve could restrain himself no longer. "I must take a sample
of these unusual crystals solely for scientific study and to
display in my kitchen." As he nonchalontly knocked off a
piece and proceded with preliminary examination, Janet and Rolf
were carefully inspecting some curious fungi covering the caver-
nous walls. "What a find! Psilocybe cubensis! Here, try some ,
a most delectable edible," All partook and enjoyed.
Meanwhile, a small riverlet of water trickled from the
space where Steve had extracted the crystal. As they watched
in horror, it started to increase exponentially in volume. The
only escape was to assemble a raft from the cave debris. As the
