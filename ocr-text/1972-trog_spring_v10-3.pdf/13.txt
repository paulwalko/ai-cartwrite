THE EVERGROWING DISCOVERIES OF HELLHOLE
Hellhole is located in Pendleton County, West Virginia
just a few miles from Seneca Rocks. It is a vertical cave that
had been explored for the last 30 years and attempts have been
made to connect it with Schoolhouse Cave for years. No one has
succeeded in finding any passage until recently when a very large
section was discovered.
In the winter of 1969 Harry Dickerson and Ron By ourke-
land from the Falls Church High School Speleological Club were
crawling around the breakdown in the entrance room. They squeezed
through a crack and it opened up into a large passage. They
followed the breakdown and maze type passage until they were
stopped by a 30' pit. Excited about this fantastic find, they
came back and joined the rest of the group and we left the cave.

A few weeks later John Bakanas, Dave Jacobs, Vic Lutz
and I went back and put up a path with rope and arrows to follow
so as to avoid the beautiful formations. Some very inconsider-
ate cavers have now destroyed most of the beauty. One of the
most unusual thing about the new section was the bat grave-
yard. The graveyard was about 2 inches. thick with bones. Not
many bones are left now because everybody wants a souvineer,
So now because of them, future cavers will not be able to see
this unusual place. After placing a path we descended the pit.
I was first down, when I reached bottom I couldn't say a word,
it was too unbelievable to be true. Everyone else came down and
we all stood in disbelief. Before us extended a room estimated
about 500'. We explored this and found many side leads. We
left a register and then started back out.
During Old Timer's Reunion in 1970, we decided to start
a survey of Hellhole and the New Section. There have been two
previous surveys of Hellhole,; one in 1938 and the other in 1946.
Both are just a map of main passages leaving out side passages
and detail,
Bob Thrun and I are working together in mapping this
cave. We have had a great deal of help from members of the Poto-
mac Speleological Club (PSC), the District of Columbia Grotto,
the Falls Curch High School Speleological Club, and various other
High School clubs in Northern Va. Many thanks go to the people
who have worked hard with the survey, Our survey of the old section
is almost complete now, and all passages in the cave are on the
map. The entrance to the cave is a 154' drop into a bell-shaped
room. The old map shows the entrance as 187', but that was
measured to the bottom of the breakdown. In a sketch of the big
room it appears to be right under the entrance room. What is so
fantastic is that all these years nobody could find virgin passage,
and it was right off the entrance room. Jan Reese is doing a pro-
