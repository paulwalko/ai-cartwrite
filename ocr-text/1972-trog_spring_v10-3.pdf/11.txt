A PRODUCTIVE NEW RIVER TRIP
Having registered on the first day of Winter Quarter, I was
faced with the problem of what to do on the second day of regis-
tration, I found out that Dale Parrott was going to New River
that day so I asked for and was granted permission to join the
trip. The rest of the party was Rolf McQueary, Steve Snelling,
Cathy Dancy, and Jerry Redder. Whe main purpose of this trip
was to map some virgin passage which had been found downstreer
during the four day Thanksgiving trip.
On the mapping portion of the trip Dale took notes, Rolf read
brunton, and Steve and Cathy were on lead tape while Jerry and I
were assigned to checking leads. We were only able to map approx-
ima tely 250 feet, but much of our time was spent checking out a
couple of interesting things we found.
While pushing the main passage we were mapping, I ran into
an unusual floor, The floor of this passage was a white flaky
substance. None of the people on the trip had seen anything like
it, so Dale decided to take a sample and have it analyzed. Imme-
diately after this, another, and perhaps more important, discovery
was made.
After all the excitement had died down, Dale pushed through
an upper lead which quickly opened up into a large room. The rest
of the party quickly followed Dale when we heard his cry of vic-
tory. While in this room we heard the rumbling of a train and
agreed that we must be close to the surface. It's possible that
there once was an entrance to the cave close by. Also in the room
Dale discovered a small grotto which had many pretty formations
and a small reflection pool which deserves photographing.
While I was wandering around the room, I noticed some bones,
which I passed off as formation. When Rolf looked at them he saw
that they were actually bones which had been encrusted in calcite.
On further inspection of the area, more bones were found. Numer-
ous leg bones were found, ranging from 5 to 7 inches in length,
as well as a jaw, Rolf guessed that the animal might have been a
skunk or a large racoon. On a later trip, the bones were brought
out for examination by Dr. Ross (from VPI's Biology department),
who identified the animal as a black bear. A bear's presence so
far back in the cave seems to verify our the ory that there was an
entrance here at one time,
