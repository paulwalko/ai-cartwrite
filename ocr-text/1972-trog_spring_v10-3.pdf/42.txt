â€œSPRING
*****TECH TROGLODYTE --1972
As the light sinks ever lower
Till finally a target is sighted below.
A point. from which one may begin
To understand one's self.
A quick glance around is all allowed
For a second member, a distinct individual,
Begins his journey down the same life path
Yet his end will not be the same, though his destination fixed. .
And once together yet still apart
Two explorers begin their path
Of searching what appears as one
Yet finding both to each.
How simple seems the searching process
Of understanding self
Yet the act consists of difficult climbs
Whose brittle untested form entice and lure one onward.
Dangerous and difficult and awkward even to see
Yet herein lies the hidden beauty
The untouched self that begs to be revealed.
White crystal formations hang like angel's hair
Mighty earthen fingers grasping forth to hold.
Yet careful now, for the mind is fragile here
These forms are easily broken by the careless intruder.
To explore the self is a worthwhile journey
But to destroy what is beatiful
Is a crime no punishment can pay.
More difficult paths are then begun
To crawl and labor for a goal
That leads one closer to the self
Yet perhaps further into danger,
The danger of losing light or meeting climbs too great
Or perhaps the self will claim its own
And there may be no return.
