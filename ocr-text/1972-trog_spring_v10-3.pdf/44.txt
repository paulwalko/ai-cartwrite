For one is alone in this newly known
And the cloak of black returns.
Fear and doubt come with the dark
And the security of self is questioned,
Perhaps forms creep in on one
As the imagination builds demons,
Or perhaps the stillness and quiet of dark
Allow a peaceful interlude.
The lamp is ready, the spark ignites
And truth of light appears.
Mystery is quickly dispelled
As the light gives form to darkness.
The passage continues but for future adventure
As the decision to return is made.
There will be other journeys into the self
For soon this path will be known to all
As this journey through the mind is mapped,
But for now the search will end
And the return to known begin.
The route seems strange as paths lead off
Luring one far from truth.
Indecision and fear emerge
As a maze of paths unfurl.
To be alone is no longer desired
And the beauty of self not seen,
For now the passage is merely a route
That enables one to escalie.
The main route is encountered
And fellow caver met.
Two distinct individuals, different in many ways
Yet strengthened together in the mutual bond
Of exploring the cave of the inner self.
The steps are re traced and the rope encountered,
