The rescue squad, backed by the town news papers and
television, prevailed upon the owner, Mr Thomas Early, to close
the cave. All efforts of the Virginia Region and the VPI Grotto
to work out a compromise concening cave conservation and safety,
failed. In two weeks a bulldozer began the filling operations,
at a cost of nearly $1500, paid by Mr. Early.
What could have been done?
First of all, as the traffic in the cave was noticibly
increasing, a gate should have been installed to limit access
to qualified and knowledgable cavers. Secondly, it should have
been realized that with the close proximity of Beacon Cave to
housing developments and shopping centers could only lead to
trouble. The town rescue squad should have been given a map".
the cave and the Rescue Roster of the VPI Grotto, so that ex-
perienced cavers could be called in to assist with rescues.
Thirdly, and most importantly, the Grotto should have taken great-
er pains to establish firm diplomatic relations with the land-
owner.
After a cave has been closed, it is too late to sit back
and discuss why it was done. A responsibility of a Grotto
should be to help educate local residents about the delights and
especially the dangers of caving. Tell local rescue squads of
your experience in cave rescue work and of your willingness to
assist in emergencies. When caves are closed, especially ones
popular with local residents, those same "cavers" will find
their way to previously unspoiled and more important, open caves,
