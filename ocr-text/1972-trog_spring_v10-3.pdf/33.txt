of lamp explosions with the new plastic model. Under these
conditions, the acetylene can quickly attain the two atmospheres
of pressure needed for explosioni
FIX D: Unfortunately, the poor design limits modifi-
cation. Try protecting the gas path by covering or plugging
the bushing hole with felt or fabric, Make a new filter from
felt or a porous sponge with smaller cells. Trim it slightly
oversize to about 2" outer diameter, 1 1/4" inner diameter and
5/8" thick.. Check that the filter covers the gas hole. Before
each reassembly, wipe the inside of the lamp and the hole, and
try to claan the filter. Good luck!
ITEM E: The filter is held in place by a fragile wire
clip which exerts: an inadequate holding tension. Consequently,
it often deserts it's groove at the first opportunity. The
brass design accomplished both filter retention and protect-
tion with a simple brass stamping that physically did not inter-
fere and was rarely lost.
FIX E: Replace the clip with a stronger retainer made
from coathanger wire. Bend it into a small square with 1 3/16"
between opposite inner edges. Before attachment, bend the cor-
ners slightly sharper than right-angles to increase it's hold-.
ing tension.

extraction of reluctant spent carbide somewhat awkward. As
the lamp cavity 'is beyond the reach of most Caver's claws, the
ready alternative is to beat the Hell out of it on the nearest
rock (or skull): with possible damage to the lamp and the gas-
ket sealing surfaces.
FIX F: Bang softly, and carry a big stick.
ITEM G: Fortunately, the reflector and striker assembly
remain the same proven design. As they still fit the old brass
lamp, they can be salvaged as relatively expensive reminder of .
the phrase, caveat emptor. Unfortunately, some time ago
Justrite replaced the handy wingnut with a grooved hexnut, re-
quiring the caver to bear some form of wrench for tightening.
The capability of maintenance without special tools is a valu-
able asset in any device which endures a life as glorious (?)
as that of a Caver's lamp.
ITEM H: The first failure endured by the proud(?) new
owner of a plastic lamp is usually the unexpected, abject loss of
the entire device (Plop!). When the lamp is brushed against the
ceiling or an obstruction,' even gently, the bracket can snap.
With reference to it's structure, the bracket is evidently de-
signed to break, although this may not have been the intention
of the manufacturer. Note the sharp angles and minimal material
