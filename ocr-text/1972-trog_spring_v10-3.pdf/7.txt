1972
CAVE HUNT
Recently a new section of Interstate 81 has been opened
from Christiansburg north towards Roanoke, providing easy access
to an area with good cave possibilities, Besides the road cuts,
there are many outcrops near? y. At the instigation of Bobby
Lewis, Rick Whitt and I proceeded to check this area, particu-
larly in the vicinity of the Elliston - Ironto exit of I-81.
Our search began on Tuesday, January 4,1972, when Rick
and I were riding with Bobby to Roanoke. We stopped 0.2 miles
north of the Elliston - Ironto exit. With two binoculars, we
located what appeared to be four holes in the outcrops on the
west side of the highway. Since it was late, we would check
these out later,
The following Friday, Steve Hall told us about some
holes that he had checked on the east side of I-81. We widened
our search area. He mentioned one place he was unable to reach
due to its location in a cliff face. We marked these down on a
topo which we had previously obtained from the Grotto files.
Sunday, January 9, our search began in earnest. Armed
with lights, hats, rope and other assorted gear, Rick and I
set out to see what we could find. We took the Elliston - Ironto
exit, route 603, and then turned onto a gravel road which para-
llels the highway. We stopped at a field. Our first objective
was a hole in the middle of a cliff, two-thirds of the way up
Pedlar Hill, at approxima tely 37 degrees 14 minutes north and
80 degrees. 14 minutes west, on the 7.5 Elliston quadrangle.
Not being able to climb directly to the hole, we climbed above
and rappelled down. It was necessary to go half way down and
then swing into the cliff. In front of us was what looked like
a large cave entrance. After we lit our lamps, we saw that it
was just a very nice shelter cave extending about 20 ' and consista
ing of one room with no leads, containing several nests which
were probably squirrel. This would be a nice place for a camp.
In order for the decond person to rappel down, it was neces-
sary to tie a line to the main rope so that he could pull it
in after the first was down. .
Our next objective after returning to the car was lunch
and then the west side of I-81. As we proceeded to check the
holes that we located the previous Tuesday, it began to drizzle,
making the leaf covered slope slippery. After several hours
of checking, we found nothing.
This general area seems to hold promise. There are
more outcrops about a mile north. Also several sinkholes are
indicated on topos of these quads. Dennis Webb and I have
checked some of these sinkholes and will have to return some day
with a shovel. Time and conditions permitting, I shall return.
