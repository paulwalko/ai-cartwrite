Although Recreational Equipment and Applachian Outfitters do
not at this time carry Premier brass lamps, they are usually
quite responsive to their friends and customers and would prob-
ably stock them if urged to do so by the multitudes, Clue them in
with a call or a card,
Where do we go from here? It is hoped that the Prem-
ier lamps will become more available in this country. It is
also hoped that Justrite will accept the challenge , perhaps
developing a super-lamp surpassing their former brass model.
