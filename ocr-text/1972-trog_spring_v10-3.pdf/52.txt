..... It has been going around the Region that Paxton's Cave is
in grave danger of flagrant vandalism and should be gated. Well,
since no one from VPI had been in there since the Convention last
June, a trip went out to see exactly what the situation is, Sup-
posedly the dog tooth spar was excavated by mineral collectors,
gypsum needles trampled.by hordes of tourists travelling through,
and all sorts of other atrocities. As it turned out, the spar
is still there and OK, the needles are about the way they've al-
ways been. Also, according to the register in the Christmas
Room, 124 people have traveled there since the Convention, which
isn't really that many for such a well known sight-seeing cave.
It doesn't seem that any significant damage has occured there, as
a matter of fact, it seems that most people have been very care-
ful. The trip last month took pictures, emptied the carbide
dumps, brushed carbide off of floors, and purposefully rubbed out
conspicuous directions back towards the formation sections. A3
far as a gating project is concerned, special thought must be
taken when considering the nature of the cave. First of all, the
entrance would be impossible to gate (3 large holes and a surface
stream). Secondly, farther back where the passage could be fitted
with a gate the walls are the consistancy of cinramon crackers
and would not hold a gate too well. Finally, the maze is SO com-
plex, at least half a dozen gates would have to be installed to
suit the purpose,
...., Mr. and Mrs Puckett, owners of Higgenbotham's and Devil's
Slide, have sold their land. Hope we can keep in contact with
them because they are some of the best friends this Grotto has.
When asked about the new landowners, Mr. Puckett said, "Coal min-
ers, right fine people.". That's good enough for us.
....Seems like we've been going through a wet period since the
Convention, because Hig, #2 has been flooding continuously since
last November. This makes a rather hairy wet-suit cave; tope it
will dry up this summer. Also, no one has been to Devil's Slide,
a nasty place in its own right, in four and a half years. The
last trip saw a blizzard, frostbite and a car wreck. Maybe that
valley is haunted.
