Even fine steel wonl will eventually scratch the chrome plating
through to the base me tal, It's best to use a milder substance
and generous amounts of elbow grease. Even though the 4 inch
reflector seems to be the most versatile size, Justrite makes a
4 inch model for their 8-hour hand lamps which has come to be
known here as the "parabolic" reflector. It is the same size as
the regular 4 inch model but has a more pronounced curvature. The
net effect is a more concentrated beam. The diffused nature of
the light is still retained, however.
I've found the most efficient method of illuminating my way
is by holding the lamp in my hand. Only when both hands are
necessary for a difficult climb, vertical work, mapping, etc.,
does my lamp find its way back onto my helmet. The advantages
are obvious. The result is much increased visibility, The absence
of the lamp from the helmet necessarily means a decrease in
weight on the head. No longer is there' need for extravagant
counter-weights. But we must consider the times when the lamp
must be worn on the helmet.
Instead of using a flat clip lamp, I find that a round
hook model can be modified into a spade which tilts the lamp
downward :while: the helmet remains in its "normal" position. I
modified a late model Autolite, but the procedure will work as.
well on a Jus trite. First, remove the spider clip, if the lamp
has one, Next,, flatten the round hook with hammer and anvil.
Cut a strip of metal - I used galvanized tin - twice the length
of the hook. Fold it to secure the round hook as a sandwich..
(Figure 1) Flux and solder. Excess solder may have to be filed
or ground away. The result is being able to bend the lamp at
an angle to the clip. (Figure 2) Finally, the universal hat
bracket will have to be filed out slightly to accept the larger
clip.
For almost two years my clip has held strongly under
severest caving activities. With the advent of the new poly-
propylene Jus trite: lamp, this modification may be unfeasible or
undesirable. But for brass lamps, I've found this procedure to
produce an amazing improvement in usable illumination.
