EVERYTHING YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT PLASTIC CARBIDE LAMPS
(BUT WERE AFRAID YOU'D FIND OUT!! )*
You are chimneying near the top of a very deep pito
Just as you make that critical move, your lamp blacks out, and
several pieces of it plunge' to dark destruction below...poss-
ibly followed by your body!
The above situation is a realistically possible incident which
could be caused: by. "meltout" with the new plastic carbide lamp,
and it is one of the more hazardous problems associated with
the device. The condition is occurring in increasing numbers of
lamps which have been described to the author. The author's
lamp has also suffered from the malady:during the second
usage, the reflector assembly detached itself and narrowly missed
landing in a batch of freeze-dried pancakes (which were already
bad enough?) Apparently, another hazard is possible lamp ex-
plosion (BANGI)
First, a bit of background information; early this
year Justrite Manufacturing Company, Chicago, terminated the
production of their traditional brass carbide lamp and com-
menced to supply a new molded plastic model. From the Caving
Clan arose many questions concerning its suitability for under-
ground use (abuse). It can be generally agreed that a caving
primary light source must be rugged, reliable and effective.
It should also be reasonably efficient, trouble- free and re-
pairable without special tools. In an attempt to resolve the
doubts about the plastic lamp: the author consulted many other
cavers who have used it, and a sample lamp was purchased for
examination. Specifically, it was a Justrite Model 3-314 with
the 4" reflector and the flat hook. The major composition is
molded polyethylene or polypropylene with occasional brass parts.
The gentlemen (?) of VPI Grotto invited a plastic lamp to a
ceremonial five-story drop - it took a bit of time to recover
the pieces. A lamp plunging down a pit is not unusual, and it
should be noted that most brass lamps can survive this interest-
ing shock test in functioning order; In the evaluation results
which follow, several unfortunate defects are described, and
most of these have been encountered in actual usage. Possible
(hopeful) solutions to the problems are also offered,
ITEM A: The water control stem is removable for clean-
ing, an improvement over the old permanent dropper design. How-
ever, the old dropper was easily controlled by it's handy lever,
