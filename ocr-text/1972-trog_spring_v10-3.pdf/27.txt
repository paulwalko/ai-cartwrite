For one man coiling, one crosses his legs at the calf
as in Figure 2, and coils the rope around his legs, thus
producing a horizontal coil. The "v!. formed by the lower legs
Functions as the "v's" mentioned above, although less effectively.

The chaining is done while the coil is on the dummy
or the legs and is not removed until the chained coil is fin-
ished. Chaining is done in the direction of coiling. The rope
is chained as any single rope would be, only the coil is between
you and the back of the chain, so the chain surrounds the coil
The chained portion is begun as step 1 in Figure 3.

OF COILING
Each successive loop is passed around the coil in the
direction opposite that of the previous loop as in step 3, Fig-
ure 3. As each link is completed it is pulled tight and slid
in the dierction of the large arrow until taut. Short loops
produce a more solid coil.
As chaining continues, it becomes clear what the
ideal length for chaining your particular rope is and if it
has been over or undershot for hhe size loop being used.
Shorter loops require more loops to finish the job and thus
use more rope, whereas larger loops will use less rope. Ad-
justments in the loop size are made so one to two feet of rope
remain when the initial link is encountered. The end of the
rope is passed through the final loop and pulled tightly as
chains are normally ended. The end is then passed under the
