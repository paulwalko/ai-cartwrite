file of the Ä‰ave along with the survey.
Within the last year Bruce Smith found a stream passage
and reported a high lead off the second waterfall. This stream
passage is off the 500'Big Room located in New Hellhole. It
has seven waterfalls with the highest one about 10' down to about
4. The exposure is very bad in this part of the cave, especially
since you will be getting tired from climbing and crawling in
water. The air temperature is 43 degrees and the water 41 degrees.
The stream disappears into a tight hole which has not been push-
ed yet because of the cold water and the limited space. Beyond
this hole can be heard another waterfall. In this part of the
cave we are approximately 500" below surface so this could pour
into a trunk channel at the water table. The only water source
in Germany Valley is Judy Springs, but the volume of measured rain-
fall and what actually comes out of the Springs indicates that
there is much underground flow. So maybe this stream flows out in
into a big trunk channel which could go just about anywhere.
The last time I was in the cave was last fall with
Ed Richardson and three other people from VPI Grotto. We
found the reported high lead above the second water fall and it
opened up into a maze section with some very high chimneys, 'Due
to lack of time we had to leaver but left is the rever: increasing
reality...of connecting Hallhole with Schoolhouse Cave,... These
chimneys and the still unexplored passage brings the depth level
back up to the level of Schoolhouse,
This summer work will be done in three areas: First,
pushing the siphon, second, checking the virgin leads for possible
connections with other caves and third, completing the survey
work. If anyone is interested in the project contact me at:

Please remember if you go to the new section of the cave
be considerate of those that follow because they would like to
see the cave in the same state you first saw it. So use common
sense and good conservation practices,
