THE CHAINED COIL
INTRODUCTION
A chained coil consists of a coil of rope with the
last twenty to thirty feet being chained around the coiled
portion. The chain coil has the following advantages:
1. Loose loops which are prone to snagging in close
quarters are not present and cannot develop.
2. The coil is compact and its form is not destroyed
by extreme abuse from activities such as packing,
dropping or throwing.
3. The twenty to thirty feet of rope for tying can
be rapidly produced from the chained part; leaving the
coiled protion undisturbed.
METHOD
The rope is coiled except for the last twenty to thirty
feet, de pending on the total length of the rope (experience being
the best teacher). Two coiling methods are used, the most desir-
able requiring two people. In the method portrayed in Figure 1,
the rope is coiled on the dummy between the "y" formed by the
index finger and extended thumb of the opposite hand. The degree
of arm extension determines the size of the coil. Since the
coil is consitructed where it will be worn, custom sized coils
can be readily made. It can be easily seen that full extension
of the arm produces a coil too large to be worn bandolier style.
The advantage of the coiling method lies in the "v's", which
keep the innermost coils on the inside, by not allowing outer
coils slip between them.
