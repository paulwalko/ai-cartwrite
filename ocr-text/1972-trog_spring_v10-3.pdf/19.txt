TRAINEE TALK
Many trainees, when they frist come into the Club,
have a hard time adjusting to both the Club and its ways and
college at the same time. Adjusting to college life is your
own personal problem. Adjusting to the Club, or trying to,
is observed by members and other trainees alike. Have you
ever wondered just what the impressions you are or are not making?
Here are some quotes recorded earlier this year, most of which
were made by members, a few were made by other trainees. But,
all of them are either about or directed to those foul underlings,
TRAINEES. Read through and see where you fit in.
"I sure don't know what's the matter with trainees
this year, but they just don't have the respect for the members
like they used to
"You keep that up and you won't get my vote,"
"The loudest one in the Club isn't always the one
to imitate,"
"To those trainees that don't know, the Club is NOT
composed of members and girls, but only members."
"Boy, trainees sure are dense, ".
"Hi ya, Sweet Boy!"
"Remember, you're just a trainee, ".
"Cavers, hell! All I can see at this table are friends
of friends of friends of friends..."
"What's belay?"
"Well, of course since he's been in a cave before he
knows all about it."
"Danger! Caution! Proceed with care! Beware of
giving advice to members!"
"Irainees should be seen and not heard."
"You'd think they could learn a few simple songs."
"You'd think they could just plain learn!"
"I just hate to see ignorant people around."
"This group of trainees are awful!"
"That's what's the matter with you...no respect!"
"How dumb can a trainee be?"
"Don't blame me, I'm just a trainee."
"No, I'm not a caver, I'm just a trainee."
Q: When in a cave, what rocks should you walk on,
gray ones or black ones?
A: Gray ones, because the black nos aren't, there.
