A bunch of us were sitting around drinking on a sunny afternoon watching the river and someone realized it was Easter Sunday
and one thing led to another. One additional "rule" was that the women hid the beers for the guys to find and drink. It worked
really well to wrap the bottles in aluminum foil - the fail helped keep the beer colder.
I remember that we actually held an Easter Beer hunt the day after Hugh and Karen Beard's wedding. Nothing was sacred....we
paid people's kids to go find beers for us to drink...

Some of the more enterprising children charged double for a beer guaranteed to be unshaken. An great example of the concept
of "added value".

I believe Cheryl is correct about Janet's cabin. The reason to do Miller pony bottles was the Miller contest we did for a few years
back then making money for the club. You could turn in Miller
bottles and aluminum cans for points.
There were also Easter beer hunts done at the Picnic site one
year it hit on Picnic weekend. One was at a house of Redders...
one or 2 were at the house in C'burg Jocko and the group rent-
ed.
The tradition obviously continued long after the collecting of bot-
tles for the contest ended (I think it only went on 3 or 4 years at
most). Many of the early bottles were decorated in foil, some
with rabbit ears :) In later years we added a plastic egg hunt for
children coinciding with the Easter beer hunt.
We may have read or heard of an Easter Beer hunt somewhere
but as far as I know it was mainly our idea to do it.
Sfor cavers.

Yep, that's what I remember too. The first Easter Beer Hunt was
Virginia y
at J.Q's Cold Comfort Farm along the Roanoke River at Dixie
Caverns. She and I, and others?, hid Miller pony bottles and
plastic Easter eggs. The paper scraps inside each egg were
probably from Chinese fortune cookies. Everyone had a great
time, we might have eaten grilled chicken, and no telling how or
when we got back to Blacksburg.

I remember planning the first Easter Beer hunt with Robyn
Koerschner. We decided we wanted to do something Easter-like
and coloring eggs became decorating beers. The rules were
modified once the hunt was started at Janet's. Somehow it didn't

occur to the women who planned it, that the guys would collect the Photo from Chip Clark, SIVTAC gallery
beers before they drank any. (What were we thinking??) The rule to
return to base to drink the beer before getting another was made on the spot and, of course, ensured that the winner was also
going to be very drunk. Wasn't this planned at the Saturday night poker party at Loud's?
