INTRODUCTION
The Cave Club is more than an organization, more than a group of people who like to hang
out underground. It's a lifestyle. I think many of you can relate when I say that I don't hang
out with other people anymore. Somehow everyone else doesn't seem nearly as interesting
as the quirky people we have in our club. I don't think any Trog could really show what our
club is like, but I sure tried to capture our way of life in these pages. Whether you're going
on a trip, to a spelioseminar, or to one of our numerous events, something crazy is bound to
happen.
I am really impressed with how many people in the club really do want to help out new peo-
ple. I was able to get my membership as a freshman because, as soon as I showed interest, I
had help learning everything. Whether you're caving with a student or an old fart you're
bound to learn something. For those of you who do want to get some more experience, just
ask and you will receive.
Thanks to everyone in the club for all that you've done to make it how it is.
