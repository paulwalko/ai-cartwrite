On the eleventh hour of Easter Beer the cave club brought to me!
Eleven still beer hunting
Ten girls hot-tubbing, Nine cavers dancing, Eight more logs a burning, Seven people tubing, Six cav-
ers caving, Five PBR's!!!!, Four creek runs, Three carbide lamps, Two jello shots, And a Keg in a bat-
ranch tree

Peppy thinks it's a good idea to hide beer on the roof. I have a feeling that beer will be there for a very
long time.
