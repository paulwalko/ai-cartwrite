Several candy companies have been contacted regarding the recent chocolate windfall. Hershey has not
returned our phone calls. Negotiations continue with the Cadbury chocolate company, but they have so
far rejected the proposed idea of 'Koala Kreme Eggs'. The corporate office replied with the following
statement:
"The Cadbury Corporation welcomes your suggestion for a new and innovative product. However,
market tests have found consumers unlikely to choose a confectionary filled with koala spunk when
more established sweeteners are available at a fraction of the cost. In addition, the eucalyptus after-
taste and side-effects including inclination to climb trees, telephone poles, and other people while
screaming 'narrgh-narrgh-narrgh' are not consistent with our brand."
Alternative uses for the candy by-product are under consideration. Please jump on Dan Crowder and
shout your suggestions in his ear.
