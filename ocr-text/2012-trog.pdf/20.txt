A Story of Sauce....
By Sauce Master 3000 and Sara Fleetwood
(As recorded in the Link's registrar)
Once upon a time, there was a jar of sauce that began to ooze stuff. It wasn't just any stuff, it
was crazy stuff! The crazy stuff began to chase the cavers. The stuff's name was Larry the Sauce
Monster. They were best friends, but want-
ed the cavers to be their friends also. So
the chase was on to catch one of them and
whip them into friendship. They began by
canyoning through the whole cave because
the floor was lava. HOT FUCKING LAVA!
With the lava and the whip, Larry the Sauce
Monster, and his second personality, Chono Dip, slimed the unsuspecting caver, Kirkalls. Kirkalls
then began to Kirk through the 5'9 in order to escape be-
ing slimed even further. Unfortunately, Kirkall's slime
made him so lubricated that he could only flail so deli-
ciously. That the crack ate him and he fell into caver world
of awesomeness! Virgin leads everywhere! He began to
feel a strange urge. He went booty-lust crazy and started
surveying any and everything he saw. Even his mom. The
moral of the story is to climb the 5'9, scoop-bore, and
have tons of fun no matter what state you are in because
you will always come out happy. Good thing Kirkall's name
was written in pencil at sign out.
