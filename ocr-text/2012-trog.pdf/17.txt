Sure enough, dangling above the pit with my hands
desperately gripping the rope and feet planted against
the vertical slab of rock in front of me, I relaxed as I
saw in my mind how I was going to rappel down into
the cave and arrive safely at the bottom. The ropes
would hold, the gear would support me, I knew what
to do, and I would be fine. With a renewed sense of
courage, I loosened my rack and slid slowly down into
the pit. Taking a moment to look around me as I de-
scended, I noticed the beauty of the moss growing
bright and green against the brown-grey of the rocks.
I walked down the rock face leading into the cave until
it ended and I had to summon up my newfound assur-
ance to relax my feet and free rappel the rest of the
way into the cave. Moving down through the air not
touching anything but the rope was oddly pleasant
and I wasn't as afraid as I thought I'd be. Smiling, I touched down inside the cave and unclipped
myself from the rope. After making my way to Peppy, Joker, and Brian outside of rock fall, we yelled
up â€œoff rope" and waited for Rapey and Deighan to come down.
Clover Hollow may not have many pretty formations, but its size and shapes are gorgeous in
themselves. Our group marveled and joked as we went deeper into the cave, rappelling down a 60-
some foot drop, arm rappelling a 20-ish foot drop, and continuing down a final 90 foot drop which
was largely a free rappel.
Once I reached the bottom of the last rappel, I walked down the canyon over wet rocks that
crunched and squelched beneath my boots, following the echoes of an unseen waterfall. The noise
was amazing, filling the rounded out space at the end of the canyon with the sound of rain. It felt
like rain too. I tilted my face up and spread out my arms, enjoying a rain shower a few hundred feet
underground.
Once I was back with the group, we detached our vertical gear and left them along an incline
leading to the rest of the cave. Climbing, crouching, and walking through the cave, we eventually
came to a bedroom-sized pocket that led to the infamous gypsum flower room. I'd been warned
about this room, but even so, Deighan and the others were so convincing I had to struggle hard to
remind myself that it was a trap.
