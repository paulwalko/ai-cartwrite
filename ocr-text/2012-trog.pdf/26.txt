5. Check your ascending gear for damage before you climb out after a death repel. This is
another obvious one, but it saved me from some major inconvenience on the climb back out, so I
have to mention it. When I was getting on rope to climb out, I noticed some minor fraying on the
bungee on the rope walker I was using, probably a result of rope burn. Everything else looked
ok, but Alex traded rope walkers with me so I wouldn't have to deal with anything else going
wrong. As it turned out, he had to tie an alpine butterfly or two while on rope to unweight the
damaged bits of the bungee. It was an easy fix, but tying knots with one hand is a bitch, so I was
glad we switched.
6. Gain experience and train with as many people as you can. As we heard many times in
the discussions after the incident, experience is the best way to prevent accidents. Go on as
many vertical trips as you can before you move on to big pits, and bug as many members as you
can to take you. None of the cavers on the Mexico trip knew about the possibility of dropping
the fourth bar at the lip, but the knowledge was in the club. It is important to cave with a variety
of members so you can take advantage of their experience and learn from their mistakes rather
than making the mistakes yourself.
Experience and the proper precautions can usually keep you from having to go through an out of
control repel. However, once you are in one, there are ways to stop it from killing you. As I
mentioned above, a bottom belay is always a good idea. There are also techniques such as leg
wraps you can use to slow your-
self down, and I recommend hav-
ing a member demonstrate these
techniques to you at a vertical
session. If you have any ques-
tions or would like a more com-
plete account of what happened
in Mexico, please come talk to
me. Happy caving!
