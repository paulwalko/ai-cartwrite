Float Trip
By Courtney Trost
You sway back and forth uneasily on the raft,
unsure if it's a set of rapids or if that “Diet
BEATLES
Coke” has finally hit you. Looking around you
see an assortment of drinking containers and
men wearing far too little clothing. Yep, you
guessed it, this is float trip.
Summer 2011 was the first float trip I had the
pleasure to be a part of, and I was far from dis-
appointed by the pure madness of a floating party. Thinking back on it, I have some
images engraved in my memory, many of
"tubes + twine +
plywood +
cavers = a
maritime shit
show”
which I'd rather forget.
An assortment of inner tubes, plywood, and
John bailing twine is put together and assumed to
Mulheren be strong enough to hold a large party. With-
out any question as to the safety or sanity of
it, I join the other crazies on
the raft and sing us off to
the sea (or river if you want
to be
technical). In
an
attempt to be “discreet"
about our suspicious activity, we pour drinks into coke bottles, solo
cups, and, for the well prepared, Big Gulp cups. Despite our best
efforts, I think it's pretty obvious what we're doing.
