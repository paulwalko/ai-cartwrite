The Story of Lady
By Lauren Waddell
For years, Lady has been the beloved whore
dog of the bat ranch, always ready to go up and paw
you like she's expecting a ring on it or fling aside a
wave of cats to lay on top of your feet. It doesn't mat-
ter where you are, she'll find you like a drunken caver
finds an Easter beer (unless it's Phil). Like a true caver
she will venture to the depths of the earth. Or at least
stick her head out of a hole close by the cave entrance.
Yeah, that's not a hell demon. Eyes kind of glow when
you shine bright lights at them. Also she might be
stuck. You might want to lift her out of the cave. Or
get a trainee to do it. Of course, though this may not
seem much, if you compare it to the 99 percentage of dogs
who have NOT been in caves (statistic complete bullshit) you
will see Lady for the true trainee she is (it's a bitch passing
your knots test with paws). She is the mascot to the bat ranch
like A.l. Cartwright is the mascot to the VPI Cave Club or Lep-
py is the mascot to the cave club suite.
| Of course you may have noticed that Lady's leg seems a little
off. You may think that's damned inconvenient considering
all the useful things you can do with paws/legs like using
them for leverage to remove banisters from walls or find/
create secret passageways from walls (or maybe just holes).
But really do you need appendages to be a badass? You can
do plenty of things with a maimed paw/foot. Like swordfight
Peppy. And climb three story balconies. And drink. And do it
all before realizing anything's broken. Why should crutches
prevent you from running around drunk? And even if it's your
In fact, crutches make excellent
weapons.
