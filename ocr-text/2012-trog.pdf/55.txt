Cave Club presents: Real Men of Genius.
By Ethan Bramble
(Real Men of Geniuuuuus!)
Today we salute you, Mr. Guy's Night Organizer.
(Mr. Guy's Night Organiiizer!)
While other partyers are worried about the guy/girl ratio, your only concern is the coke to
rum ratio.
(Needs a little more rum now!)
Cigars, booze, and such a high concentration of men that Hulk Hogan would die of testos-
terone poisoning...you've got it all.
(Caaan you feel the bromance?)
At the end of it all, you know this is night you'll never forget...or remember.
(WHAAAT THE HELL HAPPENED?)
So crack open an ice cold Bud Light, O'Sultan of the Sausage Fest, because you're putting
the 'semen' back in 'amusement.'
(Mr. Guy's Night Organiiiiiizerrr!)
