|||| PICNIC ||||
Thanks to a deadly concoction of Everclear
and something blue, Picnic was enjoyed by
all, some maybe a little too much.
Three trips through Newberry Banes caused
a little confusion with notes left at every rope
to indicate who had and who hadn't already
passed through. Towards the late evening
concern arose since only one of the three
trips had returned before dark. Many
stopped drinking and began to gear up.
Luckily the trips returned before the rescue
became serious. A rainy weekend caused the
cave to be much wetter than usual, making it
difficult to climb out of the Newberry's side.
The returning cavers were greeted with food,
beer, and a warm fire.
