The following is a true-life adventure written by Ed Day for the POTOMAC CAVER. Only
excerpts have been included in order to reduce eye fatigue:
"A group of thirteen cavers decided to start off VPI's fall quarter with a bang by go-
ing to Warm River Caveon September 21, 1963. Arriving at the cave late in the afternoon,
we rigged our one rope double in the 30-foot entrance pit. Since this drop is considered
climbable without a handline, we then pulled the rope down and used it to assist us on another short drop just inside
the cave."
Ed continues to discuss the exploration inside the cave, and notes that for the climb out of the cave that the
rope was still rigged-in for the inner drop. Ed ascended near the middle of the group and waited to unrig and coil the
rope after everyone was on the surface.
"In the meantime the rest of the party had climbed out of the entrance pit without a line, correct, I would say,
in their judgment that it was not necessary. I started up last with the coiled rope on one shoulder and my pack on
the other.
"I had climbed to about ten feet off the floor when I lost my footing, toppled over, and fell headfirst to the
floor. My helmet (I had no chin strap) came off in mid-flight and the side of my head struck a rock on the floor. At this
point I blacked out.
"Apparently I rolled, unconscious down the sloping floor and came to rest. The one person at the top of the
drop summoned the others. Then he climbed back down into the pit. I am told that I regained consciousness about a
minute after the fall, but my memory does not go back to this point for, at my earliest recollection, the entire party
was back at the pit. They had rigged a belay on me and were preparing me to climb out. At this point, I did not know
where I was or how I had gotten there, and I did not know the people who were with me. I was also in a state of pain
and was bleeding from a cut over my right ear. It was in this state that I climbed out of the pit. During the following
half hour my memory returned, and I actually drove the 'yellow bomb' part of the way back to school.

sky. We'll all miss him." -Travis Coad
