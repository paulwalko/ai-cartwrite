The Ten Rules Of Anti-Mole People Tactics
By Daniel “Rapunzel” Bishop
Certain items are necessary while caving.
Your helmet and light are the most im-
portant, and a good cave suit doesn't go
amiss. But what about your own protec-
tion? But you must not forget to pack in
order protect yourself against god's
most humble of creatures: The mole per-
son.
If there's anything I learned from the
movie The Descent, it's that the Appala-
chia and mole people go hand in hand.
But even with these pale, blind threats
cavers still go caving! Just with a level
head and adequate equipment.
Defense:
Your helmet can only go so far, and a cave suit is about as much protection as a burlap sack. A suit of ar-
mor won't do you any good in a cave, and a Kevlar would only do you good if the mole people were
packing heat. Rather – it is most important to stay out of the mole people's sight. Luckily, they don't
have any, only a sense of hearing.
Rule #1 – Avoid engagement
Cave softly isn't just a nice phrase to spout at trainees- it's an essential part of anti-mole people tactics.
It's a simple manner to avoid having a mole person notice you-watch the walls and holes, when there's a
risk of a mole person outbreak, silence is key. Keep on muddy surfaces when possible, it'll soften the
noise of your boots. Pools of water are not your friend as a mere splash could draw the enemy.
Rule #2- Use your eyes.
One of the biggest mistakes those who encounter mole people make is to not pay attention to their sur-
roundings. Even when there has been no known sighting of mole people in your cave, there's a first time
for everything. Check nearby holes and crevices, you never known what might pop out.
Rule #3 – Don't get grabbed
Loose clothing, long hair, untied shoes, you never know what a mole person might grab onto. If the mole
person's gotten that close you have already failed Rule #1, but there's no need to give the mole person
any extra advantages.
Rule #4 - Don't open carry
As tempting as a gun is, the risk of it falling into a pool of water at an inopportune moment or causing a
cave in is too great. More often than not a twitchy finger only serves to attract the mole people, and
while break down can be a useful tool to crush the bloodthirsty beasts, it is far more likely to separate
the group- never a good idea.
