Clover Hollow-January 2012
By Samantha Huff
My first vertical trip was in January of this year with Deighan, Brian, Joker, Peppy, and Rapun-
zel to Clover Hollow. Ropes were wrapped around large, sturdy trees on the edge of a wide hole
that dropped down into the cavern. Old jeans served as padding for where the ropes pressed
against the trees, the sight of which always amuses me because it seems like there should be a more
official-looking piece of equipment for this kind of thing. Brian and Joker descended one at a time,
attaching to the ropes and descending with ease into a 60 foot pit into darkness.
Once we were ready and wearing all our vertical gear, Peppy and I wove the rope through our
racks and made our calls. Listening to Deighan's advice, I leaned back into space, heart pounding as
I tried to trust the rope to hold me. Peppy and I stepped down the rock face into the hole and I be-
gan to panic. As Peppy continued down, I stopped to close my eyes and meditate, something Mike
had recommended I do if my fear of heights ever got the better of me. I thought back to what he'd
said when we picked up parking tags for
the cave from the Bat Ranch.
"Caving's very dangerous, we all know that,
but we decide to do it anyway,” he said,
standing on his front porch in a tie-dyed
bathrobe. “It's just like driving really. You
think to yourself, if I wanted to, I could do
something stupid and in one second I'd be
gone. One thing could go wrong and then
I'd be dead. We aren't afraid to drive be-
cause we do it every day and we get used
to it. We know that although we could do
something to kill ourselves and others, we're not going to do that."
As if unaware that his actions illustrated his point, he took out a cigarette and, with a startling
popping sound, lit it with a metal canister that spat out a stream of blue flame when he pulled the
trigger. Joker and I laughed and Mike continued. "See, if I wasn't careful I could light myself on fire
doing this every day. It's dangerous, but I know what to do and to not be afraid of it." He went on
to say how meditation had helped him get through some tough spots in caves where fear had para-
lyzed him before he stopped to calm down and visualize himself completing the task. He said to fo-
cus on each moment and what you are supposed to be doing and what you need to do next.
