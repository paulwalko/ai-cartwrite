flying away. But the bear was no match. They both plummeted to the ground as the
bear growled it's last soulless growl, a growl so soulless you would think that the bear must
have had a tawny hide, maybe have been a little bit of a daywalker.
By the time Lady landed the man had risen to fight of the remaining bears and rushed
to Lady's side. That man was Putin.
Lady had injured her paw in the fight but Putin rewarded her greatly by exporting her
to a land where some of the best Russian babies (also small children) had been sent (like Sara).
However, on Lady's way to the US her ship was attacked by pirates and the ship veered of
course landing in Mexico. Many flippie-floppies were lost in the attack.
Even though Lady no longer had her flippie-floppies, she traveled all the way across
Mexico to the US. Here she
encountered her first caves
and spent endless hours ex-
ploring their depths. To the
locals she was “BatDog” liv-
ing in caves during the day
and fighting crime (and
Chupcapras) at night. Many
goats swooned over her.
Eventually she made her way
over to Virginia. Lady had
lived her life heroically until
then. But it always seemed
like something was missing.
Like there was something she
needed as a dog to make her
feel complete. One day she
heard drunken singing and
following that noise she
found...
OMG PEOPLE! And thus La-
dy found a place she could
call home. A place she could
chase fireworks, cave, and be
loved.
