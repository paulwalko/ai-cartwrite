A summary of different rappelling devices
By Naomi Orndorff
During vertical caving, a more serious approach to exploring the unknown, knowing
and understanding your descending devices can be the difference between life and death.
Three common rappelling devices for the experienced caver are the bobbin, rack, and micro-
rack.
One popular rappelling device is the bobbin. It is very popular among European cavers,
yet is also commonly used internationally. As said by Gary Storrick, bobbins are “Mechanical
decenders where the rope path follows an S-shaped path”. A bobbin is made of two metal
spools, usually made of steel or aluminum, fixed to a metal plate with a pivoting metal plate
on the other side to prevent the rope from popping off of the device. For the common right
handed rappeller the rope runs in through the bottom, around the two spools in an S-shaped
pattern and out the top. The rope also travels through a brake carabiner attached to the rap-
peller's harness. To control the speed of descent the rappeller simply lifts or lowers the rope to
increase or decrease its bend through the carabiner. When using a bobbin it is important to use
a twelve millimeter locking carabiner to attach your bobbin to your harness. The thickness of
this carabiner helps avoid the possibility of unclipping the top metal plate by running the cara-
biner against the safety
gate. Thinner carabi-
ners have room to rat-
tle around in the at-
tachment opening,
which can permit them
to open the bobbin's
safety gate, or even
their own gate. A fat,
thick carabiner doesn't
have this “rattle

room".
