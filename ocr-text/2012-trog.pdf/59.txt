Florida Caverns
By Courtney Trost
Near Tallahassee, Florida Caverns is the only commercial cave in Florida.
As part of our winter break road trip, a group of us toured the cave. At a
comfortable 65 degrees, a metal door to the cave keeps the heat in and
the intruders out. The cave was mostly dug out by the Civilian Conserva-
tion Corps during the Great Depression as part of Roosevelt's New Deal
to provide men with jobs. Originally the cave was barely tall enough for
the men to crawl through, but today tours comfortably walk around the
cavern. With only guided tours allowed inside, the cave is in pristine con-
dition.
One of the tiny bats hidden I was in awe at the incredible formations. The cave was very dry with al-
in a crevice
most no mud. It almost didn't seem real, like something created for a
movie set. Stalagmites and tites remained perfectly in tact; no puppies
died in the mapping of this small passage. In one area the ceiling was covered in soda straws and they lit
it up with a rainbow of lights. Another difference between this cavern and the Virginia caves I have ex-
plored was the presence of bats. Florida has not been hit by white nose, so we were able to see several
bats which were much smaller than those that I have seen here.
Our tour guide permitted us to touch
only one column in the cave known as
the "touching post” because it was at
the beginning of a small incline where
an elderly person probably needed to
grab onto it for support. The contrast
between this column and those around
it was incredible. This oily black
"touching post” did not look as though
it belonged in the cave. I am now much
more careful when I see formations in
other caves, knowing that human con-
tact alone can kill their beauty.
