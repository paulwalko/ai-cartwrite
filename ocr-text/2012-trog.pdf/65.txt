Possible Cave Club Dissertations
By John Mulheren
Over the past four years, I've probably spent more time on caving and tomfoolery than
studying for my classes. Because of this I think that the Cave Club should offer degrees.
Of course you can't just give a Cave Club diploma to any old loser. My solution is to make
every Cave Club diploma seeker write a dissertation on a subject that contributes to Cave
Club culture! These are example dissertations I could easily write. Feel free to submit
your own!
Does a glowstick count as a source of light? No.
Dance moves that can be used to keep warm while others are climbing
How to use the recovery position to make sure people don't Jimi Hendrix.
40's or flasks: How to efficiently destroy your brain
Techniques used to scare away girls from cave club parties
In rage, I threw a boy scout down a pit. Now what?
Hypothermia and flatulence: silent killers of cavers
