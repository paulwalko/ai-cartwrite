Interview with the President:

Q: What do you like most about caving?
A: Unfortunately it is no longer socially accepta-
ble for me to play in McDonalds play houses.
Caving is the next best thing.
Q: What is your best memory from this year?
A: Leading trainees through a partially flooded
Smokehole.
Q: What is your favorite Cave Club event?
A: Easter Beer. I love wrapping up Kool Aid
bottles and placing them so the kids go ape shit
on sugar highs.
Q: What do you like most about being presi-
dent?
A: When people hum the president song as I walk by.
Q: If you lived in a cave which one would it be and why?
A: Links is the perfect temperature. Plus it's within run-
ning distance of the hot tub.
Q: What is your drink of choice?
A: Ron Burgundy. Or a Steely.
Q: What are you planning on doing next year?
A: Failing out of grad school so I can lead more boy scouts
on terrifying trips.
Q: What is your ideal date?
RESIDEN
A: Take a girl to a cave. Bring some candles. Maybe some
chocolate strawberries. Maybe some sexy music. And
then survey lots of virgin passage!
Q: Describe your ideal woman
A: Beautiful, blonde, smart, sexy, sitting right next to me.
