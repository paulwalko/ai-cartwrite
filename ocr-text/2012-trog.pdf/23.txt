Another common rappelling device is the rack. Although there are
different shapes of racks they all work on the same idea. A rack is made of
a U-shaped metal frame with steel or aluminum bars running across. The
rope is threaded through this series of bars. To vary the speed on a rack the
rappeller can vary the number of bars the rope runs through and slide the
bars up and down on the rack. By sliding the bars together more friction is
created making the rappeller move slower, when the bars are moved apart
friction is removed and the rappeller moves faster. Some racks have a hyper
-bar as the first bar which is an extra long bar with the excess hanging off to
the side and an upward facing pin toward the outer end. The hyper-bar is
used to create more friction and lock off the rack. When using a rack the
rappeller should never descend on fewer than four bars. It is also important
to rig your rack correctly so that the rope is holding the bars closed opposed
to pushing them open which detaches the rack from the rope which can end
in fatality. Another problem with the rack is that feeding rope through the
rack can cause bars to fall off and a sudden loss of friction occurs, this can
be avoided by holding the rack with your non-braking hand.
Finally, there is the micro-rack which is a smaller version of the rack. Although Scott
McCrea says “The micro-rack is unique among racks in that very little variation in friction is
available”. However, you can vary the friction by using the hyper-bar and with a long micro-
rack the bars can be moved; this is not the case with a regular micro-rack. A micro-rack works
with the same concept as a regular rack in that the rope weaves through a series of bars cross-
ing a frame. Since the micro-rack only contains four bars no bars can be removed, and most mi-
cro-racks have a hyper-bar as the first bar so there is an option to add more friction. The micro-
rack is especially useful because it is compact which makes it somewhat easier to maneuver
over a lip, it is easily locked off, can be used for most drops and can be used with most sys-
tems.
Bobbins, racks, and micro-racks are all commonly used rappelling devices around the
world. They all have their own way of using friction to control the speed of a rappel, therefore
they all have specific types of drops they are good for.
