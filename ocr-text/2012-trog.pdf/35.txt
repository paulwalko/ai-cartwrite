About halfway through the trip Deighan was nice
enough to lend out his canoe with the promise of a
romantic canoe ride, which I never got. Seeing the
raft from a little distance only affirmed my idea of
how insane we must look. One of my greatest memo-
ries is seeing the raft float under a low tree while eve-
ryone
screamed
â€œDuck!"
and
scattered
one side of the raft. It was also great to see how our party extended
past the raft as a few canoes and kayaks follow along and a couple of
determined swimmers kept up behind.
Since the river was so fast this trip, we actually had to tie up on the side
just to get our expected par-
ty time in. After being parked
for half an hour or so we
proceeded our way to our
drop off spot, hoping that
someone could control the raft enough for us not to miss it. Some-
how we made it safely back to land. Those of us still feeling moti-
vated tore the raft apart while others sat on tubes to deflate them
faster.
A caravan of a
few cars took
more people
than is recom-
mended or legal back to Blacksburg to unload the remains
of the raft and drop off those who wanted to continue the
party at the Bat Ranch. I will always remember float trip by
the absolute insanity of a floating party, and by the insane
sunburn I took home as a reward.
