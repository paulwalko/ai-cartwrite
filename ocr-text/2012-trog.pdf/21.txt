The Virginia Cave Board Revival
By Dan “Joker” Crowder
THIS CAVE IS
PROTECTED BY
VIRGINIA STATE LAW
Back during the fall semester it came to the attention of the
Cave Club that the Virginia Cave Board was going to be consoli-
dated in with other boards in the Commonwealth Government.
The Virginia Cave Board, for those of you who don't know, the
Cave Board is the agency that helps protect the caves in Virgin-
ia. They pursue prosecution of people who deface caves as well as issue the signs we all know in the
Caves are unique sensitive environments.

entrances of caves. You know, the ones about not eating the cave critters.
Needless to say it would have been a huge blow to cave conservation if it were consolidated. This was
brought to the attention of the VPI Cave Club at which point a huge reaction took place. Along with the
signing of a petition to be taken by delegation to Richmond, the VPI Cave Club also enlisted the VAR
(Virginia Region) cavers. The VAR sent in a large number of letters and emails to the board of consolida-
tion protesting the consolidation of the Cave Board.
A letter writing campaign was not enough for the VPI Club. There was a letter drafted which was signed
by a large number of Blacksburg area cavers and most of the College of Natural Resources at Virginia
Tech. The Blue Ridge Grotto also had a major hand in the drafting of the letter that was to be taken by
the cavers to Richmond. A delegation of cavers consisting of Rebecca Stewart, Ellen Koertge, Joey Fa-
gan, Rich Geisler and Dan Crowder went to the meeting of the Virginia Cave Board. They were joined by
members of the Richmond Area Speleological Society.
In the end it was the efforts of the letter writing campaign that won the day. The combined effort of
cavers from all across Virginia and the surrounding region kept the Virginia Cave Board alive. That being
said the initiative was spear headed by the VPI Cave Club.
In the future the VPI Cave Club needs to remain vigilant. This is not the end of the Virginia Government
trying to do away with the cave board. Next time they try
the same thing should be done. The combined cavers of
Virginia should be called upon to help the effort of pro-
tecting this valuable asset. That being said, next time you
go into a cave and you see that sign saying, "This Cave is
Protected by Virginia State Law", give yourself a little pat
on the back for spearheading this endeavor. Remember;
a bunch of college kids still have a voice and can influ-
ence the decisions of their government.
