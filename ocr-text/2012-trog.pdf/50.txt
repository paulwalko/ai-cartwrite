Does anyone know when the first Easter Beer Hunt happened? I know it predated the Bat Ranch at VPI
by several years. I recall going to one or two on Main St. and/or maybe at Glen's on Progress St. before
the Bat Ranch existed as such.
Did the idea originate at VPI Cave Club?
have word that there will be an Easter Beer Hunt in
Austin TX this weekend, too!

I recall the first one was at Janet Queisser's log cabin on the
river in Roanoke. Must have been about 1973 or 74. She (and
others?) hid those little (Goz?) clear bottles of beer with the
wide mouths around her yard, I think wrapped in Al foil. Can't
remember what they were called, but I bet it was Miller inside.
The rules were that you had to drink the beer when you found it
before going on to find the next.
Seems some plastic eggs were also hidden with a ticket inside
for a prize.
Don't remember much else besides roaming around finding beer
and drinking it, sometimes in a group, sitting on the grass. So it
must have been a good party.

Pony bottles!

At some point I remember we started using a marker to write
the year on the lids. Not every Easter beer is found the year it's

Cheryl is right the 1st Easter Beer hunt was indeed at JQ's in Roanoke.
As far as when it was not '73 or '74. It occurred when Miller was running their
campaign to have Miller drank and the club participated. If I remember the rules correctly we got points for Pony bottles or
Miller bottles in general. Separate points were given for aluminum cans. We were so far out in the lead we started selling
the cans instead of just getting points.... Yes we over did things even back then.... I am guessing that the 1st Hunt was '76 or
'77 or even as late as '78 - that year 6 of us lived in Christiansburg so we were close to JQ's place.
hidden......
