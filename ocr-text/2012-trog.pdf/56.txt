The Goat Song
By John Mulheren and Brian Burke
Me and my baby got a love so pure, I ain't never gonna ask for more
When I'm 'round her I ain't got nuthin to fear, she likes it when I stroke her beard
Well my baby she does all the chores, but she's too short to open doors
She knows how to treat me right, except for when she tries to bite
Cuz she's a goat, she's a goat and a love her dear
But I gotta get her drunk before she lets me near
I put a funnel in her mouth and pour the whiskey down
She looks real pretty when I put her in her gown
Well she's a goat, she's a goat and I ride her like a bike
When I mount her I know what heaven's like
I make her say baaa and I make her squeal
Our goat-human love is the real deal
I made her my goaty bride, when the preacher saw us walkin' he 'bout up and died
He said our love was an abomination, but he ain't ever seen our copulation
My baby had a kid and it's easy to see, looks kinda like her, and looks kinda like me
Well I'll never forget the first thing he said, he said "I wish, I wish, I wish I was
dead!"
Well she's a goat, she's a goat and a love her dear
But I gotta get her
drun before she lets
me near
I put a funnel in her
mouth and pour the
whiskey down
She looks real pretty
when I put her in her
gown
Well she's a goat,
she's a goat and I
ride her like a bike
When I mount her I
know what heaven's
like
I make her say baaa
and I make her
squeal
Our goat-human love
is the real deal
