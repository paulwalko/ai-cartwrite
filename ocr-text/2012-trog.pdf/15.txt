Rule #5- Stick together
A large group means more hands, more eyes, and a better chance of survival. This means that
pinch passages must be used with extreme caution, and long tube crawls are not friends.
When the groups spread out mole people feast.
Rule #6 - Don't sacrifice yourself
A valiant effort may seem like a good idea. Occasionally tackling a mole person off a cliff
might be the best way to go, but this is not so. One of the first laws of these horror scenarios is
that any sacrifice will almost immediately be in vain as it greatly increases the other party's
chances of attack. The same rule applies to sacrificing an ally- karma is indeed a bitch.
Rule #7 - Never bring a 2 way radio
Not only are you in a cave, where a radio is as about as useful as a brick- but their ability to
make noise at the worst time is only matched by first time caves. They are a dangerous luxury
you can't afford to use.
Rule #8 - Choose Your weapon.
Range is what you need, but sadly in a cave your line of site might only be as far as 10 or so
feet. You need a blade that's versatile and compact. This is why a machete is the perfect tool
for your cave trip. Its blade, when kept sharp, can render a mole person harmless with one
swift blow! For those of us who are lacking in machetes car keys are NOT an appropriate al-
ternative. When you're out of the cave you have to escape before some farmer hits you with a
shovel and throws you back in.
Rule #9 - Report your findings
The NSS has a record of all caves with Mole people, but as the infection spreads it is im-
portant for their records to be up to date. While some are brave enough to tackle a cave with
these fiends, most cavers don't
want to come up to bat with
these strange creatures.
Knowledge is power.
Rule #10- Don't panic
Even with blood thirsty mon-
sters all around there is always
hope! Keep put and allow sign-
out to take its course. If all goes
well dozens of cavers will ar-
rive, machetes and
flamethrowers in hand!
Remember kids- Cave softly,
and carry a big blade.
