3. Always have a Deighan at the end of your rope. I know we had a very long-winded de-
bate about the importance of bottom belays over the dreaded listserv, but as this article is pri-
marily aimed towards trainees, I think we will all be in agreement that a bottom belay is a good
idea. Once you're completely out of control, it is the job of the person belaying you to try to bring
you to a stop. In my case, John Deighan put as much tension on the rope as possible to try to slow
me down. I dropped the full 700 feet and didn't even break my glasses, so obviously he did a
pretty good job. And this is just as important in the caves in Virginia; a 200 foot drop will kill you
just as well as a deeper pit will. I've also heard of different techniques being used to stop the re-
peller, such as running uphill to change the rope angle. It's a good idea to ask the members on
your vertical trips to instruct you on the best way to belay someone at each individual pit so you
are more prepared to belay in the future. Each cave is different! Also, to those of you who refuse
bottom belays, consider this; your friends will feel really shitty if they have to stand there and
watch you die when they could be doing something about it.
4. Wear good gloves and sturdy clothes. This is
one aspect of my accident we never really dis-
cussed that went very right. Of course I was wear-
ing a pair of gloves when Alex Booker did my safety
check, but he recommended I replace my synthetic
gloves with a pair of Deighan's leather gloves as an
extra precaution. I changed gloves, and the leather
and insolation ended up saving me from losing all
of the fingers on my left hand and possibly from do-
ing more damage to the rest of my body once my
fingers were gone and unable to provide extra fric-
tion. I was also wearing a sturdy pair of jeans, pro-
tecting my legs from serious rope burns as I used
With her brain bucket award, Sarah was giv- them to grasp the rope for friction. I have a nasty
en a pair of medieval armor gloves. These scar on my left thigh as it was, so I am very thankful
should protect her in the future.
I had those jeans on.
