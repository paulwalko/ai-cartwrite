A Trainee's Guide On How To Not Die While Repelling
By Sarah Crowder
As many of you already
know, I got my ass kicked
by an open air pit in Mexi-
co called Huahuas. Upon
arriving back to Blacks-
burg, a discussion ensued
about how to prevent
such accidents in the fu-
ture. However, we never
really mentioned the ba-
sics so that new trainees
would understand what|
on Earth actually hap-
pened, and we failed altogether to mention the things that went right. In order to combat these
holes in our conversation, I took it upon myself to write an article aimed at new trainees giving
repelling tips members might forget to mention:
1. Always use four or more bars!! We'll start by going over the mistake that actually caused me
to fall down the pit. If you have only three bars in contact with the rope when using a rack, there
simply isn't enough friction to keep you in control. You will go into what some like to call a death
repel, which is something I would not recommend experiencing. In my case, I already knew this
critical piece of information. I was on four bars going over the lip but due to the rope angle, I
dropped a bar by accident. If you want a better explanation of how this happened, please feel free
to ask me about it; it's much easier for me to show you than to tell you.
2. Be patient at the lip. When you're standing at the edge of a 700 foot drop (or really any
drop) and you're having trouble moving, it's easy to psyche yourself out. Be patient! If I had re-
mained on five bars instead of four and just accepted the fact that getting over the lip was going to
take forever, my accident never would have happened. Stay calm, keep a clear head, and have
confidence.
