Although he knew what to expect, Peppy volun-
teered to go down anyway, headfirst, at
Deighan's suggestion. We were all amused by
his gung-ho attitude and his humor at finding
the "gypsum flowers." Climbing back out of the
tube is the hard part. It's not very far, but the
tube is so narrow that it is nearly impossible to
get any kind of leverage to wiggle your way out.
Peppy tried for a long time but eventually had to
be pulled out by both arms.
Joker felt his pride would be hurt if he didn't go
down too. He's a bit claustrophobic and was very hesitant to go into the hole, but he said he couldn't
back out now, "not with Deighan sitting out here judging me." To which Deighan agreed that he was
indeed judging him.
As we waited, we discovered that we could hear a regular pounding noise throughout the little
room. Joker stopped and said, "Guys, do you hear that? You can hear my heartbeat." All of us were
quiet and listened to the rhythmic pulse that was so loud and so close that it was like hearing it
through a stethoscope. Despite his best efforts, he also had to be pulled out.
Continuing on, we finally reached The Library at the end of the cave. It's a sizeable room with
large boulders to sit on, fake potted plants some cavers had managed to bring all the way down there,
and a sealed barrel full of outdated porn magazines. Deighan passed out old issues of Hustler and
some magazines without covers for the
men to read.
"Sorry, there's only one guy one,"
he said as he passed a magazine over to
me. It featured ridiculous hairstyles, hairy
chests, and thick bushy porn mustaches,
some examples of which I showed to the
others. In turn, they showed the group
pornographic comics and a few center-
folds of incredibly obese women. The
group's favorite by far was a close-up of
an asshole that had a penciled in speech
bubble next to it saying "Get me out of This is probably what Peppy and Rapunzel did after that trip
here!" and another below it that said,
