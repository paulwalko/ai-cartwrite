2012 VPI Cave Club Financial Report
by Brian McCarter
It's been a busy year in caving finance. European guano futures have expanded more than anticipated,
resulting in a gross income of 30 million (Kazahk pesos). However, a failed venture into using old cable
ladders for harpsichord strings consumed nearly all of the profits.
The 'Cans for Steve' television fundraiser was a major success, being carried by the TCA network
(Troglodyte-Caver Alliance) in all major markets. Those markets include caves all over Giles county, none
of which have reliable electricity, so reception was understandably spotty for the troglodyte component
of the TCA. Cavers picked up the slack, with calls coming in from as far away as China. Three beef candy
wrappers were donated, with approximately 75 micrograms of aluminum content each. There was actu-
ally more aluminum in the candy.
The ACA (Armchair Caver Association) has suffered severe financial losses this year after the dismissal of
its two most prominent members: Steve Lepera and Scott Rapier. They were convicted for embezzling
enough cash and PBR to buy off Steve's PhD committee. Punishment included 8 hours hard labor in Clo-
ver Hollow and a fine of one dozen cupcakes (made with excess koala chocolate).
Banquet was a wash. Ticket sales included 120 cavers, 2 land-owners, and 3 koala bears (with marsupial
discount). However, the koalas were caught pocketing money they stole from the coat closet. They were
summarily wrapped in duct tape and beaten until candy and condoms fell out. So-called 'pi√±ata' torture
has been banned in 37 states, but it still legal in Blacksburg and surrounding localities. The VPI cave club
has since secured a production contract with the Trojan condom corporation for a new line of 'K' contra-
ceptives. You may have heard the radio commercials with the slogan, "Sex? K."
