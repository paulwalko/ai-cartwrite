Lady
By John Mulheren and
Courtney Trost
Lady, the Bat Ranch dog,
Known as the attention hog,
Lacking in wit,
She rolls in her shit,
But I'll pet her after enough grog.
From the hilltops I want to shout,
She's a faithful pup, no doubt,
By the entrance she lay,
All through the day,
Till all of the cavers come out.
Her dingleberries hang from the rear,
Even after a bath I don't want to go near,
I've heard locals say,
From ten miles away,
Her stench killed a whole herd of deer.
Friendly and loving you'll always be,
The doggy face we're so happy to see,
You reek of poo,
But we still love you.
You're the only Lady for me.
