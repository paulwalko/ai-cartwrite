While I was not at the first EBH I attended a couple others. The ladies were nice enough to hide a few cokes for me as I did
not drink beer. :)

This certainly implies that any male who can remember an Easter Beer Hunt wasn't there or must have been blind.

1974, I was there. Miller pony bottles

The first Easter beer hunt was indeed at JQ's, probably in '75 or
'76 since I lived in Roanoke the time. Perkins was in particular-
ly fine form after sampling the goods. We went to the Bonanza/
Ponderosa steak house late Sunday afternoon after the party.
There was a sign out front that said they were giving away free
bibles. Unfortunately, when we were going through the line we
found out that they were out of baked potatoes. Perkins asked
in his outside voice if they thought he was a f**king termite,
that he couldn't eat a f**king bible. We hustled him out of the
restaurant before anyone in their Easter Sunday finest decided
we shouldn't be there.

Well there is the answer. The Easter Beer Hunt was probably an
original idea by the ladies of the VPI Cave Club. I knew the year
had to be after I returned to VPI and 1974 was the first Spring at
C-3 so makes sense. It was also probably the first year of the
Miller Contest (tho it went by quarters). In any event it predates
the bat ranch by 15-20 years? The year we had it at Picnic was
in the late 80s probably by the ages of the kids there.
I also remembered Perkin's quote from Lynn Richardson but had
forgotten that it was after the beer hunt. The f**king termite
story was re-told for many years.

The first Easter Beer Hunt was before I got there in Fall '74, so 1974
Carol Zo way 1982
would fit.

The first Miller contest started after I got there. It was probably Fall of
SIVTAC gallery
1975. I still remember going to the kickoff meeting where one of the
reps said "VA liquor laws are really weird. Everywhere else we pro-
vide free beer at these, but in VA you can't have free beer. You can
sell it for 10 cents a glass, though, and there's no law against giving away dimes." And "There are two categories in the con-
test: fraternities, and everyone else. Otherwise, since the frats will dominate, no one else would have a chance." Little did
they know...
