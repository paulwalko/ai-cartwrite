LETTER FROM THE EDITOR
So, it's been a pretty awesome year. Since it's my first year as editor I'm not really sure what I'm
supposed to say here, probably something about how awesome all the submitted articles were,
which hey they were! So thanks to all who sent me something. There couldn't be a Trog without
your submissions. I'm glad to see that we have a good amount of variety with serious and super
silly articles. It's cool to see how varied our club is and how much we've done over the year.
It's cool to read about the numerous cave trips our club has led, through well traveled and virgin
passage. Each event we hold creates some great memories, or lack of memories for some. It's awe-
some to have somewhere to record all of this through stories and pictures. Personally, I think the
pictures are the best part of the Trog, so I felt the need to include a lot. Thanks to everyone who
let me steal pictures off of their facebook (not as if I asked). Considering I probably have spent
more time working on this than on school work over the past month, I hope you enjoy it!
I encourage everyone to keep submitting articles so that we can have just as awesome of a Trog
next year!
