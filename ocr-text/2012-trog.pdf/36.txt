TAGO
The 34th annual TAG fall cave in held in Lookout Mountain, Georgia had a huge turn out this
year. Many VPI cavers dropped Valhalla while others repelled one of the cliffs in Alabama
with an amazing view. The Friday night party started off with the lighting of a wooden boat
and shortly after turned into a karaoke fest with appearances from Tommy, Kirk, and John
Bowling. Saturday night started with the fire lit by a flaming arrow and progressed from
there. Personally I do not remember a whole lot from that night but I was told it was a great
time. Sorry to Phil and Sam for taking their bed, aka their car since someone forgot the tent
poles. I guess it seemed like the best place to pass out at the time.
