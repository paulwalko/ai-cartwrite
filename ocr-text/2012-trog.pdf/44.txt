gushed into my Wellies, it leveled out. We walked in the holy silence of the cave until we came to a
small beach where the hill finally swallowed the stream. We bent over and shined our lights into twen-
ty foot wide horizontal crack. On the far left there was a little garbage and a basketball. The basketball.
We had connected Sparks! We jumped up and down, yelled, and hugged each other. Then we took an-
other look. Could we push through that? Joker decided he would give it a try. His whole body sunk into
the water and I followed him with my light until I heard the sloshing as he stood up on the other side.
He yelled back, “You have to take off your helmet.” So I took off my helmet and slid down into the cold
water. I crawled with everything but four inches of my horizontally tilted head under water, pushing
my helmet ahead of me. The airspace got smaller and I started to feel panicky and then I was through.
Sam and John came up behind me. We plowed through the next two crawls which now seemed easy
and we were out into the night, up the road, and back to the car.
Epilogue
Later in the week we fin-
ished mapping the main
passage and about half
the side passages. Rebec-
ca Stewart also ended up
doing the plunge for the
full Sparks experience.
