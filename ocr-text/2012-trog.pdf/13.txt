I had a sugar crash from not eating all day (I had an unfortunate
run in with the Cleveland Browns in the cave and as a result wasn't eat-
ing much).
We went through the crawly bits and the wet bits and subsequently
ran into yet another crew (BRG mania Crew) who helped us roll up our 5000
feet of phone line. After that the VPI dam broke.
We found Ray, Scotty, Deighan, Brian, and many others including team
honey badger (who wish it to be known that, and I quote, "they didn't
give a shit!").
Through this whole ordeal Guido had been brandishing his FM radio,
which was providing valuable insight to those of us who speak white
noise, and his trusty cave machete for beating back... well
everything. He victoriously crawled out of the cave waving it around
and terrifying the guy standing at the entrance to the cave.
I hope I have provided some insight and background to this story. If
there is anything to add DO IT. I was just happy to see so many of my
trainees gain-
ing so much
valuable expe-
rience
and
providing so
much
help to the
lost individu-
als.
Also a shout
out to Greg
Springer for
general bad-
assery and go
getter
mind frame.
