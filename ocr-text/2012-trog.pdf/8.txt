LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT
As always, we've had an extremely eventful year. Our club has gained six new members, and we
have a handful of folks who are on the brink of membership. Because of their enthusiasm, there
have been a metric shit ton of cave trips this year. Tons of fresh virgin booty has been scooped, and
hundreds of students have been exposed to caving. We've had a large presence at a cave rescue or
two, and had a few accidents of our own. Also, Club social events have been characteristically ac-
tion-packed.
I think that these achievements show how unique our organization is. A lot goes in to making this
club tick, and I would like to thank all the people that help make the VPI Cave Club the best thing
about Virginia Tech and Blacksburg. To all that have lead cave trips, trained new members, joined
us for caving, helped at club events, helped at a rescue, held a speleoseminar, and continued to sup-
port this club, I would like to extend a huge and heartfelt THANK YOU. Without you, the VPI
Cave Club would just be another outdoor organization. I hope that next year is just as fun, hectic,
and adventure filled as this year.
In conclusion: ashes to ashes, beer to piss.
- John
