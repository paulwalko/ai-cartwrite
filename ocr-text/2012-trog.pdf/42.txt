Trip Report Filthy Young Women 2012: Sparks Cave
By Matthew Skowronski
On Monday, Wil Orndorff assigned myself, Joker, Sam, and John to Sparks cave, which was an un-
connectable stream cave that goes through a hill but sumps out at some point, to survey. When we
walked into the southern entrance around eleven, we realized immediately that it was going to be a grim,
wet, stream crawl, mess. So, we did the first shot from a rock to the beginning of the low ceiling. John
forged ahead in about a foot and a half
of water and about that much air
space. Sam read the instrument data to
me for the second shot as they both
squatted in water. Then we all went
and in about twenty feet it opened up
again into a beach room where we
could all stand up. We took a few shots
and I broke out my candle so we could
all warm up a little. Then we did another, even grimmer stream shot and crawled through again. Again, it
opened into a beachy room where lo, the way ahead was an even grimmer stream crawl that I could not
even see the other side. Some garbage and a basketball had accumulated in the right side of the crack.
We were really cold and we decided it was time to head home.
After showers, cave gear through the dryer, some coffee, and a kitchen dance party, we were
ready to try the other entrance. Southern Joker got us landowner permission, and we headed in.
