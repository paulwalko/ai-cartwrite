Time and patience; patience and time. ::..
We dozed for another six hours, Ed's contacts started to ..
irritate him. Dick's Boots were bothering him. I felt a bit i
nauseated and the thought of food revolted me: Lew started to
apologize for the incontenience, but we shrugged it off and made
jokes about it. What else could we do? We speculated and conjec-
tured upon what rescue proccodures wou7.d be taken, if any.
"What time is it?" someone would say.
"One n'ulock," I would answer,
"Day or night?"
So it went.Raduim dial watches are nice in total darkness..
We joked about missing our Monday classes,
On Lew's. next-to-the-last visit to the siphon, he decided
the 6 pom, Monday would be the very earliest we could expect the
siphon to open up. The rate at which the. Water was falling had
decreased due to reduced water head.
About 7 p.m., we gathered up our equipment and started for
the siphon. We were all astounded by the great effort required to
walk. It is surprising how much energy it takes just to keep warm
for 50-odd hours.

Gary: The rescue was finally underway. Three cavers had remained
at my apartment in town to maintain communications between the
rescue groups and also to bring more help or equipment, if needed.

A brief stop was made by the three-car caravan at Rich Creek
for supper, contacting the West Virginia State Police, and a call
back to VPI (in hopes that the missing cavers had returned). We
were told that the missing cavers had not returned, that UVa and
D.C. cavers were on their way, and that the campus radio station
(WUVT) wanted a statement. Rick gave a brief outline of what
little we knew about the situation. This information was broad-
cast to the students and placed on the AP wire. by WUVT, firom which
a garbled account appeared in next morning's Roanoke Times.

A West Virginia patrol car met us just across the state line,
Rick explained the situation to the trooper, who radioed ahead,
instigating a search for Ea 's VW in the vicinity of the Snedenar-
Crookshank caves,
Our trio of cars pushed on, stopping only in Lewisburg: for ..
a quick call back to Blacksburg. The cavers still hadn't returned.
