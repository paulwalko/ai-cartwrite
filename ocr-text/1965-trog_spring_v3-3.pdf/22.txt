... After rigging the drop, the cavers prepared to descend. The
first man on the rope was approximately ten feet past the breakover
when the rappel rope broke. "He fell 120 feet and was dead when
the others reached him,
Besides pointing out the need to carefully test ropes, this
accident also defines the type of accident in which a prusik
safety, or any other safety device depending upon the rappel rope
for support, is useless.
i
A belay, however, is independent of the rappel rope. Should
the rappel rope break' (possibly by wearing on a sharp edge), come
untied, or pull its anchor (tree, boulder, stalagmite, or piton)
loose, the belay rope is unaffected and is still capable of
catching and holding the rappeler. .
The second accident, at the 180 foot drop in Newberry-Banes.
system in Bland County, involved a person who was not a member of
the VPI Grotto, Ellen Witherito, the nonmember, lost control and
began to fall. She grabbed the rope in panic and pulled her chest
safety knot down with her, instead of allowing it to catch her.
Ellon struck a ledge and lost her grip on the rope, allowing the
safety to work. It caught ten feet above the floor, saying her
life.
A belayer, safe at the top of the drop would not have been
handicapped by the fear and/or panic that besets the falling ra-
ppeler. A chest safety, by its very nature, works (except after
special training), only when the rappeler is unconscious. The be-
lay is much more flexible. Not only would a belayer stop à fall
almost as soon as it occurs, but, with vocal communication and time
to think, the rappeler could leisurely decide upon the best course
of action. He may either ask to be lowered to the bottom or may
resume rappel position. Other advantages are that the rappeler
may stop at any time and, by asking the belayer to hold him, have
both hands free to: fix a troublesome lamp, tighten a loose knot,
shift his rappel position, or study a high load,
· Belays are practical on any drop that is not free space. As
long as the rappeler has a wall to keep him. from spinning, the two
ropes will not tangle. Despite the possibility of tangling the
rappel and belay ropes, a belay should always be used by a caver
inexperienced in vertical techniquos. Novices should doscond only
after a more experienced caver, so that competent help is available
at both ends of the rope,
The first man to descend should always have a belay, as .
pointed out by the Catawba Murder Hole accident. If the drop is
unexplored and of undetermined depth, the belay is even more im-
portant as a safety device.
