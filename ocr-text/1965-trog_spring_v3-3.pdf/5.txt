Then move him about twenty feete an wen he settles down you drive
two more stakes so they line up with the net:. directshun that
lizzard is lookin. Then you streh a string between the secund
two stakes and another string between the first two stakes. Wear
them two strings cross you boer youre well and you dont have to gete
worked up in a swet worring about wether youre goin to hit water--
you can bet youre bottom you will and lay back and smoke cigars
wile the dam drell ri hammers on the hole.
There are sum tecknikal questions about these lizzards that
I wood like to call to youre attention at this point. I went up
to a university in Pencilvainia an talked to Doctor Otto Van
Zander in the Bylolgie Department there to get this informytion
an he sent me a bill for 700 bucks--therefore I hope you note
the following with reverence and care.
(1) Sum of these lizzards needs callibration. They got a
miner rite or left hand airor that cums from the fact that the
distance from there branes to one eer aint ezactly the saim as the
distance from there. branes to the other eer, Doc Van Zander says
this fowls up his audyo persnecktive and that kind of a lizzard
dont look square in the direcyshun of water. But I linoe how to
callibrate one like that,
(2) You got to put thease lizzards in a round jar big enouf
for him to turn around easy. Doc Van Zander says that if the jar
has corners the lizzard: heers refleckted sound waives off the flat
sides and gets confuzed. You caint callibrate even a good lizzard
in a square jar.
(3) For hi sensetivity you got to let theese lizzards get
hungery, Its a kind of a delikate art linowing wen thoose lizzards
are at there peek sensetivity. One day you got a reel sensetive
lizzard and the next day you got a dead lizzard from starvation.
Tor that reason you shud by at least 4. of theese lizzards for a start
In conclushun I wood like to send you 10 good lizzards. They
bin checked for reel low audyo prespecktive airor-les than the
dyemeter of the hole at two hunderd feetie All 10 are picked for
sensetivity--if a lizzard dont look down the road toward the Gulf
station shortly after somebody goes in the rest room down there we
knoe he cant here vater run at 4 hunderd feet and we reject him--
we do allow him to miss one time out of 3 becaus you never knoe
vhat sum people go in a rest room for.Advyse mne by return male an
I will ship you 10 by express. Try all 10 an if they dont tell you
exactly where the water is you dont owe me a dam cent. After
proper trile you will ove ne 50 bucks. If it wasnt for that 100
bucks Doc Van Zander charged ine I would give you the first ten.
I aint so good a speller but I know about lizzards. I gotta
dickshunary but its no good--if you dont knoe how to spell a word
it takes a helluva wile to find where it is in the book and if you
knoe how to spell it you dont need the dam book.
