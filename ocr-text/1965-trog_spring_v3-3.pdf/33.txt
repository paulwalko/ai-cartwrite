ORDEAL IN CROOKSHANKS'
Whitt: It all began when three members of the VPI Grotto decided
to go caving with the Baltimore Grotto, otherwise known as "'Lew
Bicking." As a result of this trip, we decided to bestow some
honor upon Solo Lew, and we could think of nothing more appropriate
than to make him an honorary real person. In fact, we have drawn..
a conclusion (implied in the opening sentence) that lew is the only
person in the Baltimore Grotto everyone else is ficticious.
The cave we decided upon was the notorious Snedegar's-Staircase
system, Lew would show us as much of Snedegar's and Crookshank's
as we wanted to see if we would help him map Staircase. So 'Saturday,
January 9, saw Ed Bauer, Dixon Hoyle, and I leave campus late in
Ed's VW. 'Before we got to Pearisburg, Ed couldn't stand it any
longer, so we stopped and took on a supply of suds before continuing
on to Lewisburg. We arrived in Lewisburg in a drizzlo, parked it,
and quickly located Solo Lew, eating alone, as we had expected,
in the Court Restaurant. We, however, preferred hamburgers, and,
with no further delay, left for Friar's Hole.
When we arrived in that vicinity, the rain had nearly stopped,
but the road was too muddy for us to drive any closer than Snedegars'
water entrance, We took a few minutes to smooth out some of our
ruts before walking around to the dry entrance.
The dry entrance to Snedegar's is quite picturesque; a large,
rectangular opening in a flat limestone escarpment. Inside, we
deposited a supply of dry clothing.

The entrance to Staircase is not quite so picturesquc, nor is
it pleasant. The sinkhole slopes gently down over rolls of dis- .
carded fencing on one side, and a small stream cascades down over
flat-lying slabs on the other. Several horizontal cracks open in
the upper parts of the sink, but the real opening into the cave:
is a slimy crack in the very bottom which leads immediately to a
30 foot drop. Here we began our survey. The trip progressed
smoothly and as rapidly as is possible in that cave. The passage
is mostly a high, narrow, sinuous fissure with a stream occupying
the entire floor. Most of our surveying was done along the top of
the fissure where it is wider and drier. Of course, anything dropped
into the stream was immediately swept away.
When we reached the end of the fissure and surveyed down to
where the two streams join, we had a choice: . Wo could survey
"Uncle. Earl's Domepits, or we could survey on through the "express-
wayıl to tie in with Crookshank's, then survey à 1000 foot side
passage in Crookshank's. For some inexplicable reason, we decided
to survey in Crookshank's, a decision which probably saved our lives.
As we made our way downstream along the Crookshank's trunk
channel, we stopped to rest in a small, sand-floored side room.
There, before my very eyes, Ed and Dick did something that graveled
my speleological senses. They produced several cans of food and
