Now. let's go back and look at another safety rule. A typical
rulle.. may' state that when taking deep-drop caves and a belay is
not used, a chest prusik: safety should be used." Without anumerat-
ing the obvious flaws, I shall again cite a typical case.
.
#3--Two years ago, a group of experienced vertical cavers
gathered at: Aunt Nelli√©'s Home to witness a prusik race. The vart-
ical side of the hole has a nasty breakover, but it was necessary
to rig this side for the race. Before the action began, A.L.W.
decided to rappel into the hole for kicks. As he inched over the
edge., his prusik safety jammed between the rope and the rock face.
A.L.W. managed to free his hand by relinquishing his glove and his
grip on the knot. His feet were in free space, so he couldn't
kick: aut from the wall to free. the knot. As his strength ebbed,
he slid dawni, the knott went under tension, and he was kung for
sure. In order to free him without rigging a hoisti, G.H.M. took
a carbide lamp: and, leaning far out over the drop, burned the
manila Sling irr two. A.L.W. was then able to finish the rappel,
This is one instance of a chest prusik causing trouble on a
rappel. Similar incidents occur quite often at Maybrook Sinkhole,
the Cascades, and on many caving trips. It is my sincere opinion
that when a so-called safety device, be it a bolay or a prusik,
causes situations such as I have mentioned above to occur, then it.
ceases to be a safety device. If, in a particular case, my refusal
to use one makes me unsafe, then so I am. Maybe I'll live longer .
this way.
In conclusion, I would like to say that I am not altogether
condemning the use of belays, but I am trying to point out that true
safety should be decided by an individual's common sense, not by
rules.

THE CASE FOR BELAYS
A belay is the most independent and reliable of the many
available safety devices.
Its superiority can be shown by examining the two serious ac-
cidents that have occured in the VPI Student Grotto.
The first accident took place at Catawba Murder Hole near Salem.
The cave is entered by descending a 130 ft. deep sinkhole. Most
parties rappel into the sinkhole and climb back up one of the less
vertical sides.
