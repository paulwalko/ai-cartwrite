liuch work remains to be done in the caves of Virginia and it
goes without saying that there are many opportunities for individual
cavers as well as entire caving groups to ma ke substantial con-
tributions to the files of the Virginia Caye Survey.
Sometime during the fall of" 1965 a meeting of all cavers
seriously interested in working on the Virginia Cave Survey will be
held on the V.P.I. Campus in Blacksburg. This will be in conjunctior.
with the annual meeting of the Virginia Region which is now tent-
atively scheduled to 'take place in OctoberDetails on this meeting
