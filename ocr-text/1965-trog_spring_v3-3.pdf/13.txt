George Titcomb and liason Sproul then proceeced to show slides
on the Texas-Ilexican trips of the past year, after which people
headed for parties and such.
.
After we (V.P.I. cavers) spent a comfortable night at Alan
Armstrong's in nearby liºGaheysville we arose early and headed for
3-D llaze Cave.
There we met a rather large group of cavers from American:
University and seyeral others from Friendship Heights, all seeming. Iy
in a state of confusion. (They seemed to think we were in a state
of intoxication). We stumbled through the cave, descending the
drops and amusing ourselves in listening to tie connents of several
: of the flashlight-toting neophytes. After this sobering experience
We piled into our cars and arrived back at Tech by 8p.m. on Sunday.
