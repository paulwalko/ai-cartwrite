NEW METHOD OF DIVINING
As many of our more or less regular readers have noticed,
the opening pages of the Troglodyte are usually reserved for new
technical information. This time we are re-printing a letter that
comes to us by way of Paul Helbert, who worked for the State Geo-
logical Survey last summer The original letter was sent to the
Soil Conservation Service Department of the United States Depart-
ment of Agriculture, and typed copies were sent to engineering
geologists, EWF units. An introduction to the letter reads:

"The attached procedure for locating water wells was recently
referred to me. I have not evaluated the procedure but on the
surface it appears to surpass the use of a peach bough and it
appears to be founded on sounder physical principles,"

We are re-printing the letter here due to a recent articIe
in the NSS. NCIVS which explained how divining could be used to.

in the same manner. (Of course, we don't believe that there is
any such thing as an entranceless cave. It's just that some caves
have entrances that are underground.) No attempt has been made
to correct spelling errors in the letter,

Dear lir. Culp:
. . I knoe you cant admit the fact publickly since that research
program probably cost a pile of money but I am sure 'by now you have
given up the idea of ever finding much water with the truck lode
of elecktrick junk you been sending all over the country.. Stands
to reason since as far as I knoe nobody every found any aleck-: :
tricity in any water fit to drink and whats more if there wus do
you think them elecktriclaI engineers wood send all that water thru
a helluva big waterwoeel and a decktricity generator? you knoe
they woodnt, They wood squeeze it right out of the water without
any foolishness, . Despite the fact that they been on the rong
track for years them felloes jorking for you are a reel nice bunch
of felloes and I wood like to help them outa the hole there in
About two years ago I discovered a breed of lizzards in a spring-
house in Wisconsin that has an unuzal talent for lowcating under-
ground water. They get all there food outa the water there in
and if you keep them in rain water with no food in it for about
two weeks they get so hungery they can here water runnin under-
ground even if its two hunderd feet down. All you have to do is to
set one of these hungery lizzards in a round glass dish full of
rain water on the ground close to where you are looking for
water then wen he settles down you drive two stakes in the ground
so they line up with the directshun that lizzar√°s looking :
