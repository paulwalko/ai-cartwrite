WANTED: A LITTLE COOPERATION
RecentIy: a group from. our grotto decided to take a shorts
evening caving trip to a local cave for the purpose of getting
some photos. We all left campus with the hopes of getting some".
good action shots to show the folks over the Christmas holiday,
However, these: hopes quickly disintegrated when the land ..
owner told us, "No soap.t. This decision was not the result of him
not knowing us, for the leader of our group had met him several :
times previously.
The reasons for closing the cave, as he said, was that a
group of cavers from another college √ùrad entered his cave last
summer without permission. After this irrtrusion, his drinking
watter Was muddy for two weeks,
Although it is tho opinion of all those who have seen this
cave that the pools at the extreme and have absolutely no linkage
to his water supply, the owner could nothie or would not be convinced.
Ever the promise of a set of prints from the pictures taken would
note: sway him. Therefore, this scenic cave remains closed until
the owner once again tastes the milk of humari. kindness, if" ever.
This type af occurrance happens only too often to members of
ali grottoes, but: the entire blame cannot be placed on the shoulders
of the owner. The members af the group who visited the cave without
permission were definitely in the wrong.. Although it is highly
unlikely that their visit: had anything to do with the muddy water,
it; did provide a scapegoat: for a man who was, and still is's too
stubbarn to listen to any reasoning except his own.
Itt is wonderful that we don't come in contact with this type
of owner all of the time, or caving would not be the flourishing
sport it is today. However, since it is: our misfortune tio meet.
them occasionally, we must; bend over backward to convince then that
they are right in everything they say or do, while at the same time
try to persuade them to let us in their cave, All it takes is a
little mistake (like not asking permission) to close a caye for a
long timele Cooperation, no matter how ongimsided it may be, will
go a long way to combat; ignorant pride and stubborness, and it
may even open up some caves for us.
