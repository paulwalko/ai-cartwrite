returned with the observation that it had become apparent that
we would be here longer than 24 hours.: Lew calculated that the
water was falling at a steady rate of inch per hour where we
were bivouaced, which meant about a two inch per hour drop at the
siphon where the passage was much more narrow. By now, it was
6 Sunday afternoon and the fact that we had missed breakfast was
becoming harder and harder to ignore,
For the next 12 hours, we slept in fits and dozes. Dick and
I decided that since Ed was the largest in circumference, he should
sleep between us for the same reason a small child would use a
teddy bear. Sunday night wore on into Monday. Lew checked the
siphon again and figured at least another 12 hours before we could
effect an escape through the lowest pointi

Gary: As a safety precaution, the VPI Grotto maintains a sign-out
sheet for caving trips. This list gives the driver, destination,
and expected time of return.
Ed Bauer had put down 6 pon. Sunday as time of return, but
none of the trio were really missed that night, One or two cavers,
who came by their rooms just assumed they were elsewhere.
By Monday morning, word began to spread among the cavers that
no one had seen Ed, Whitt, or Dixon since Saturday. Whitt was to
give the trainee test that afternoon, and , when the trainees were
unable to find him, rescue organization was begun in earnest. Two
groups of cavers were organized independently by Rick Nolting and
Mike Hamilton. By 5 p.m. Monday, these two groups had contacted
each other and combined forces.
While a first-aid kit, caving gear, and other essentials were
rounded up, Mike Hamilton kept O&P solvent with phone calls to
Baltimore, D.O., Charlottesville, etc. His job was to find cavers
familiar with the Snedegar system, since the only VPI Grotto members
who had even been in the system were still in it. The UVa Rescue
Network, unfortunately, was of little help. After three attempts
to explain the situation to the Security operator, Mike finally
contacted Mason Sproul, via a person-to-person call.
Still not sure whether or not a rescue party was needed, three
carloads of VPI cavers headed toward Lewisburg at 6 p.m. Monday. i

good, but it required constant nursing, and the resulting smoke
made it hard to see and breathe, so we let it go out. Nonetheless,
we decided to try again Monday morning. It had been about 40 hours
since that meal in Lewisburg, SÂº We were running short of any
internal heat. Our second fire was even smokier than the first,
and we were finally forced to extinguish it for fear that we
