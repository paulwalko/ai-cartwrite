N Naturally, since it was 3 a.mand we were on a loncly highway in the
most uninhabited part of West Virginia, I ran out of gas while still 20 miles
from Lewisburg.
Dixon, after 56 hours in the cave, got to shiver some more while we
waited for Bob Mead's car to come along. After nearly an hour, with a truck
heading north the sole traffic the entire time, Bob arrived and drove to and
from Lewisburg for gas.
· Bob's car was developing trouble, so he stopped in Lewisburg to get it
checked. We stopped for gas and breakfast, Dixon had his first meal in 56.
hours at the Court Restaurant in Lewisburg at. 5:30 a.m. Tuesday morning.
Back in Blacksburg, by 8 a.m., I picked up the Roanoke Times and read
with interest about a trio of cavers lost in an underground cave,
Later that day, Whitt and Ed were interviewed by John W. Hall, an AP
correspondent. The interview had been set up by the VPI Public Relations
Department at the request of the AP, and gave Whitt and Ed an opportunity to
clear up a great deal of the 'misinformation present in the first story.
The value of this leisurely conference showed"in Hall's story, one of
the most factual and non-sensational "cave rescue" newspaper stories to appear.

Bill Karras, chief of the National Capital Grotto Rescue Squad, has
written an interestingpiece of fiction about this rescue operation, Unfor-
tunatoly, the article has been reprinted and accepted as true by a number of
grottos across the nation.
Everyone makes mistakes, but Bill Karras did not seem to consult the
facts at all. There are ten major mistakes in his article. Besides naming the
wrong cave (Crookshank-Snedegar "system", not Crossbones), he stated that he
arrived at the scene and talked with VPI students (he did not get to the cave,
and talked only with U.Va. students, who met his group as they were returning
from the rescue).
This sloppy, completely misleading, incorrect piece of fiction being
passed off as a true account of a rescue operation galls the editors of this
publication. There is no reason for one article to have so many serious errors,
. As a result of that article, thispuhlication finds itself wondering if :
other rescue accounts have been similarly embroidered". We cannot, therefore,
as a protection to our readers and our grotto, reprint or quote from such
articles as the Schroeder's Pants Cave Accident Report until Åsgut al by a second
source that the report is at least partially accurate."
There may be errors in the articles which appear in this publication, but
most of them are minor. We fail to see how anyone can make as many errors in a
single article as were made in the Snedegar's accident report (Trapped in Cross-
bones Cave) by Bill Karras.
Hail to a new low in accurate speleoliterature,
