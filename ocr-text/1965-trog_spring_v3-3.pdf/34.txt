began to heat it over carbide flames. Such wanton time consumption!
A few candy bars wouldn't have been so disgusting, but we only get
to go caving once or twice a week, and then they waste valuable
time eating. Lew and I didn't refuse a few handouts, though, but
only because it would get rid of the food quicker so we could con-
tinue mapping.

Mapping on the upper level progressed more rapidly and with
much less effort than mapping in the Staircase. The passage was
large and flat-floored, so in no time we had surveyed a distance
almost equal to the entire length of Staircase. We finally reached
a point where the passage seemed to be blocked by breakdown, so we
terminated the survey and entertained thoughts of breakfast in
Lewisburg.
- As we made our way along the low, wet crawl into the main
trunk channel, an ominous roar reverbérated down the passage, When
I could finally get a full view of the stream, I remarked, or,
rather shouted, to Dick something to the effect that I could swear
the creek was 20 times louder than before,
"We've been in quiet passage for a long time," he said.
"Perhaps you're right," I said, "but the stream looks bigger,
too." And with this, I headed toward the siphon. Instinct told
me that, though I would get wet going through the siphon, I'd
better stay dry now. About 500 feet along the passage, Lew ran by
me, dry-suited, up the middle of the stream.
What's up, Lew?!! I shouted.
"The water is upi Can't you see?" and he sped on past us. In
a matter of minutes, we were at the siphon. "The water is four
feet above the siphón, " Lew shouted. "We're trapped, damnit! We're
trapped i This cave will let you in, but it won't let you out!"
"How long do you think we're in for?" I asked.
"Twenty-for to 48 hours," Lew said. "We might as well go
back to the dry place."
Pretty soon, we were back at the place whero we had caten
the canned food. Lew had set up a stick to gauge the rise or,
more hopefully, the fall of the water level. Then we hudaled
together like canned sardines to try and get some much-needed sleep.
The first 12 hours went by comparitively fast because we didn't
do much besides sleep. This was not unusual after 11 or so hours
of mapping. By now, we were getting rather tired of lying on
those particular lumps, so we hunted anound and found a flatter
place to nap. Meanwhile, Solo Lew soloed up to the siphon and
