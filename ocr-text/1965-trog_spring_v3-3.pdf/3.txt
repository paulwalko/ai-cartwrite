EDITOR'S COLUMN
Every grotto wants status. When we discovered that none of the big-name
grottos publish on time, we couldn't bear to be different. We therfore de-
layed publication of the Spring Troglodyte for this reason. This is just
another step in the improvement of the status of student grottos.
New officers have been elected, and this presents us a problem. Our
grotto elects officers each spring, near the end of the school year. The rea-
sons for this are both obvious and good. However, the NSS News publishes new
grotto officers at almost the same time -- each spring. Result - our old
officers are listed for the entire year and our new slate of officers appears
on the News just before elections which thusly makes that listing obsolete.
We never catch up.
Anyway, Paul Helbert is our new president; R. E. Whittemore, among his
many other duties, remains vice-president; Craig Peters decided to stay on as
georotary; and Ed Morgan is our new troasuror.
VPI finally has a patch. It sells for $1.00 to members and $1.75 to non-
members. The design is a full-length likeness of John Veitch inside a car√°-
biner. John is wearing a hard hat and light, has a rope over his shoulder, a
canteen at his side, and his hands dragging the ground. His looks are Oriental,
but this is understandable, since the patches were ordered from Japan. With
six different colors, VPI can truthfully boast a "colorful" patch.
Ed Bauer gave a report on VPI's trainee system at the 165 Convention.
This is our answer to the problem of conservation. The convention was the
best-attended so far; congradulations, Indiana cavers.
PSC's loss is our gain. Anne Braithwaite, former editor of the Potomac
Caver, has moved to Blacksburg and is now Associate Editor of the Tech Troglo-
dyte. Annie is a welcome edition to our staff. Now, only the World's Most
Active Caving Organization can boast of having a gremlin on their newsletter ::
staff. Thank you, PSCI
