A second Council meeting will be held at the spring projedt
in Ilay. I think everyone present felt that through closer unity
of the various grottoes, as was seen at this meeting, the Region
will grow in strength and influence, and as a result serve its
members better. The Region became further unified at a party
following the meeting, where all the representitives revelled and ·
scraped together. ::

MORE RELARKS OI TIE SINGLE BRAKE BAR
I read, with a great deal of interest, two recent articles by
Dick Sanford which appeared in the Potomac Caver, The articles
dealt with rappeling hardware, and particularly the single brake
bar. (refer to Vol.viii,' issues no. 8, 10-11). They were well
written and accurate, and they showed a clear understanding of the
physical principals involved in the operation of a mechanical
rappelling device. Also they were objective, giving both the ad-
vantages and disadvantages of the various methods of descentra
Dick explains their operation and points out the possible hazards.
Therefore, I am puzzled by the point by point attack these
articles received from Peter Grant (Jan. 165), Pete's remarks
were, for the most part, unconstructive and unnecessarily sarcastic,
He brought out several valid points, but discredited them by filling
the rest of his essay with poorly-founded personal opinions and
vague generalities, a sharp contrast to Dick's more scientific
approach.
.
Pete opens by stating that he is against the single brake bar
because he wants to keep hospitals and graveyards empty of cavers",
implying that the single brake bar is suicidal, His motive is ad-
mirable; we all want to prevent caving accidents. He then mentions
two accidents in which the caver involved was using a single brake
bar, concluding that the accidents occured because the single brake
bar was used. With all que respect to Pete, this is a very poor .
line of reasoning. The first accident he mentioned occured last .
spring in Newberry-Bane's Cave near V.P.I. : This resulted not from
the use of the SBB, but from the use of poor judgement on the part
of the leaders of the trip. From all I have determined from talking
with people involved, the victim was completely unqualified, by
virtue of her inexperience, to talre the 180' rappel. By having been
permitted to enter the cave by those who should have knoin better,
she should certainly have had a belay from above, which she did not.
I personally know of one fatal accident where the victim was
using a body rappel, I have seen or heard of accidents involving
