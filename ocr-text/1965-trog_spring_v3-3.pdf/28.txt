wa's one expecially. beautiful room, about 150 * 60 feet, containing,
among other things, a large rimstone pool. The walls of this room
were quite marired up, and we spent half an hour covering up the
names with rocks and mud,
The way back was uneventful and tightia There was a great

what may be Virginia's deepestt cave, Butt all I could think aboute
was the test's I had taken that day, and how funny my alarm clock
sounded going off þe:fore. I had even gone to bed the night Befone,
So., as we roared on up the valley in Sam's station wagon, I slid ::
slawly into the arms of Morpheus.
I was awakened sometime later by the hideous Odor of burning
sulfur, and I knew Sam was at it again; setting aff dynamite caps
to get his jolIies. I managed to clear away a few cobwebs before
the firstreport woke me up completely. Sam was trying to tell me
something about how I'd better get changed and pointing to the
group of ropeladen cavers' already starting up the hill. I knew
