SINGLE BRAKE BAR IS BEST
A preceeding article by Ed Day (pages 78-79), a former and
respectted member of this grotto, also appeared irr the March issue
of a non-NSS caving publication known as the Potomac Caver. When
it's appeared in the caver, it was followed by a rebuttal which
somehow failed to successfuly refute anything Ed said. In fact,
itt caused me to appreciate the essays By Ed and Dick Sanford even
more.
Dick: Sanford used physical principles and mathematical formulas
to justify the single brake par. Ed Day used his own first-hand
experiences. Other than false premisis, one cannot be sure what
Pete Guarrtti usedo Inasmuch as I lack Dick's Inowledge and Ed's :
great experience, I have found yet another way in which to prove
that: the single broke bar is the most practical meams of executing
a rope: descerita Being a Business student myself, I corsider cost
and practicality synonomous, as long as s'afety isn'ť sacrificed.
The preceeding articles: By Ed Day and Paul Helbert prove, I Believe,
that there is no sacrifice of safety.
First, Iet:'s look: a ti the equipment required for the towa. ad- .
vocated types of rappel; the single brake: Þar (SBB), and the three.
carabinier rig (TCR). Since, a swis's seat and a carabiner are re-
quired by both to attach either rig to the rappeler, they will be
omitted in this considerationa
Whem a brake: bar is in closed position, the carabiner is auto-
matically locked, So, to keep the odds ever, only locking carabiners
will be considered when not used with a brake bar. Therefore, 3
locking carabiners must be used with the TCR, and a plain carabiner
and brake bar with the SBB.
We shall first add up the costi (via Co-Op) of components
recessary for a SBB:
Carabiner
$ 89
Brake Bar
1 * 25
Total
HA
Now: l'etiis see wható a TCR Will Costi
Locking Carabiners
(3) @$1.50
Total
Now, subtracting one from the other, we get:
TCR
SBB
Difference:
$4.50
2.14
FA
$2.36
It is evident from: these figures that one could purchase two
SBB rigs for the price of one TCR, and have enough Ieft over for a
draitha Sa. far, I haven' to mentioned such things as the weight of 3
locking 'biners, or the extra pas tage when ordering, and I won't
because I don't believe any further arguement is necessary..
