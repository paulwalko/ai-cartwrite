VIRGINIA REGION SOCIAL, DECEMBER 5 & 6, ENDLESS CAVERIIS, VA;
The supposed yearly business meeting of the Va. Region barely
qualified as yearly and certainly didn't qualify as a business
meeting. A fall social might have been a better name for itmine
re-election of heroes, slide shows of the desert, commercial caying,
etci, etc.
I guess I'm justo bitter because, after each grotto was given
the choice of two dates for the proposed meeting (either of which
was suitable to V.P.I.), a third date was chosen by the hierarchy,
placing the big day on the weekend before exams. (This is one way
to cripple those sophmorish student grottoes.) In spite of this
poor planning, nine of us arrived at the Endless Caverns Lodge
early Saturday afternoon.
.: After a quick tour through Endless Caverns, led by Bob Blackburn
we met above ground in the chilly meeting hall and listened to the
presentation of several papers. The first dissertation was one by
Roy Charlton on the use of magnetic induction devices for the pur-
pose of communication and location in caving. Much time and ex-
pense had evidently gone into Roy's research, judging by the large
coils and electrical equipient which he has used to successfully
locate underground passages from the surface.
. Sara Corrie, from West Virginia, gave a talk on "Relationships
of Geological Structure to the Origins and Development of Caves in
Folded Limestone Regions." This illustrated lecture vas made that
much more interesting when Sara used examples of caves in our area
with which most of us were familiar.
After a short talk by Bill Stephenson on a summer trip to the
Rio Camoy system with Russ Gurnee and families, we were treated to
one of Lovable John Cooper's slide shows, called 'Further Adventures
of a liisplaced Dud."
Directly after this came the business meeting at which each
grotto is represented by two representitives; WACS had one, and
the region at large had one. The business consisted solely of the
re-election of John Cooper as chairman and Betty Lloyd as Secretary,
and the election of Bili 'Karras as vice-chairman. Although it was
clearly evident that many topics of regional interest demanded sol-
utions, dinner was served and the business meeting was promised to
be resumed in January. (The date was finally set for liarch 6th.)
After a leisurly chicken dinner was served to most of us in
the lodge restaurant, we adjourned to the meeting room for the
evening session.
Lyle: Conrad gave a very alarming and interesting report on
caves whhich have been closed in the Va. Region, Several other names
of closed caves were added from those in the audience and it was
certainly made evident that we have a serious regional problem,
A list of tize closed caves is forthcoming. The problem seems to
be primarily the usual one--discourtesies to the land owner.
