DEAD AIR CAVE
by Jim Cooper
Personnel: John Eads, Paul Holbert, Mike Youso, Rick Nolting ....
One afternoon about one o'clock, we gathered behind the SAB
carrying camera boxes, ropes, candy bars, and the usual gear, ..
Several of our group, mainly john Eads and Paul Helbert, were
intent on photographing the formations of Dead Air Cave. We got
underway an hour late (average timing) and started down Rt. 11. to
Smyth County, where the cave is located. Entering the cave with ...
ropes, we met John Eads inside. He had gone in through another
smaller entrance excavated on a previous trip by Joe Smyth. The
photography trip was reasonably successful except for the flash
bulbs wasted trying to photograph the entire cave. The main room,
which is, in fact, the only room, is about 700 feet long, 300 feet
wide, and about 200 feet high.
I was quite interested in the crystal mushroom forma tions in
the center of the caye. The cave also has nico rimstone and soda.
straw formations.
About 9 p.me, we crawled out the second entrance and headed for '.
the nearest restaurant for food. One of the waitresses was snowed
by Youso's beard. He managed to fight her off, however, and we
made our way back to campus, arriving about midnight.
After reaching Tech, we made an excursion through the com-
mercial cave beneath the campus and called it a night.

the campus about one o'clock and headed for Bluefield,
