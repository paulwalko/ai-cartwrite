WHAT IS A TROGLODYTE?
Have you ever noticed the evolution of technical language
these past few years? It seems that every group has a new jargon
all their own, which to the outsider may seem quite odd. For in-
stance a shift, which to most people is a style of women's dress
which resembles a maternity garb (and for several serves the same
purpose), is a knife to the average punk.
Cavers also have their own language which tends to astound and
confuse the average non-caver. The idea occured to me to ask the
average ilman on the street what a few caving terms were. AIthough
the vast majority answered that they didn't know, a few stalwarts
(who evidently didn't want to profess any lack of knowledge on any
unknown subject) gave the following answers.
