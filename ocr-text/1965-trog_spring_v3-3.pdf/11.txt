COIPLAINT DEPARTIIENT
..Te did receive one other letter commenting on our last issue,
and it was really unusual. It seems that someone actually found ..
fault with it. This really amazed us, because we have worked very...
hard to make the "Tech Troglodytet the best speleological journal
printed by any. Grotto, and we believe we have attained this goal. .
Nonetheless, a letter from a lír, "C" criticized us heavily for
a certain comment which was meant to be humorous. Evidently, we
milked one of lír, C's sacred cows. We here at V.P.I., evidently
being more broad-minded than some people, have no sacred covs, nor
do we shudder before the caterwalls of those who do.
Since complaints seem to be the order of the day, perhaps this
is the place for a few that we here at V.P.I. have. It is a shame
that the last Virginia Region meeting had to be held the weekend : -
before exams here at Tech. This seriously hampered our attendance,
but we were represented. But it is a shame that our representatives
had to go to Endless Caverns for almost no reason. You see, except:
for the election of officers, no business was discussed or voted
upon.. Perhaps the inconvenient date is the price we have to pay
for being a student grotto, but who's fault was it that. the meeting
only accomplished 50 per cent of its intended purpose? The official
business was eventually conducted -- 280-odd miles from V.P.I: in
Washington, D, C, At least Nev liarket was centrally located.
How long can we afford to be part of the Virginia Region at this :
rate?
· But Ive gotten off the subject a bit. There is something I
forgot to say about Mr. C's letter. · He said that our last issue
would hurt us as a student grotto. Now it really seems oda that
he would say this. Best I remember, a letter signed itVirginia"!
appeared in a certain newsletter last summer and the answer started
out by saying, "Yes, Lew, there is a Virginia,"
How can someone criticize us for hurting student grottoes
when they seem to be directing many efforts in the same direction..

SPELLOTHOUGHT OF THE 110NTIT:
In light of all the sit-ins and lie-ins going on around the
country, why doesn't the V.P.I. Grotto invite the Student Ion-
Violent Coordinating Committee down for a cave-in.
