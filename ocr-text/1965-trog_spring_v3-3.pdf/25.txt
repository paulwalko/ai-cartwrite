TRIP REPORTS
3-D MAZE CAVE
: 12/6/64
by: Addison Wilkins
Personnel: Eแบก Bauer, Dixon Hoyle
About moom. an. Sunday, December 6; Ed Bauer, Dick Hoyle, and.
I arrived in high spirits ato 3-D Maze, a small cave near Harrison-
burg.
There to greet us were ten boys and six girls: (1) from the
American University Grotto. Not far from a farmhouse, we found
the entrance to the cave, a medium-sized hole in the bottom of a
small sink.
We chimneyed down a narrow, sloping fissure whose rough sides
provided plenty of foot-holds, sore elbows, and rips in the pants.
At the bottom of this estimated 100 foot deep crack we discovered
nothing but one glove and two or three meager soda. straws, so we
ascended to the top to explore the horizontal extents of the maze.
There we found the American U, group rappelling down another,
20 foot deep passage (ropes weren't really necessary, but two of
the young virgins in the group had never been caving before).
Quite fed up with this tri-dimensional rathole, we ascended to
the entrance just in time' to be pleasantly trampled by the American
University ladies coming out of the other end of the passage they
had explored.
. Though we were only in the cave from 1 to 3 pomo, we decided
to head back to Iech arid study for exams.

3-D MAZE CAVE and SALLY STEPHENS CAVE 1/24/65
Personnel: Bill Armstong, Ken Hosallock

Bill and I met Ken at a service station at 8:30 and proceeded
to the 3-D Maze Cave, arriving about 9. The main purpose in making
the trip to 3-D'Maze was to find the 80' fissure pit mentioned in
Caves of Virginia.
We located what appeared to be the pit, as it matched the lo-
cation of the pit on the map, then continued. through the cave as
the others had not seen the cave before. After two hours of this
"grueling!! exploration we left the cave and headed to. Sally Stephens
Cave located north of Harrisonburg just off the bypass (Rt. 81).
After a 20 minute walk we arrived at the cave. This cave is entered
through an entrance arch about 30 ft high and 20 ft wide. There
was little to see in this cave, and the complete exploration (in-
cluding knocking down all the icicles in the entrance) took only an
hour.
We hiked back to the car and descended on Ken's mother for
lunch. After lunch we located, but did not explore, several other
caves in the area.
