Whitt: . When we reached the siphon, our hopes and spirits suffered
a slight lapse, as the siphon appeared to be closed. Not to be
outdone, Le Ã± went to work with his trenching shovel and dug a
small channel in the stream bed to hasten the flow of water out
of the siphon. Three more hours of waiting in the mud was re-
warded with four inches of air space at the lowest point. Lew
crawled down into the siphon for a final .check.
"if we wait two more hours, we'll have two more inches," he
informed us. After a quick conference, we decided to compromise
ideal conditions and the demands of our stomachs, and proceed
immediately through the siphon. Lew took one end of a 50-foot
length of rope and crawled into the cold waters; and then, one
by one, the rest of us siid in alligator style and moved swiftly
through the low parts, I was without a flashlight, so I had to
follow the seemingly aimless meanderings of Dixon's light. In a
matter of seconds, he exclaimed that dry land was in sight, then
proceeded to recite an imaginative list of four-letter words. I
was a bit confused until I found that the last ten feet of the
siphon consisted of several seasons' accumulation of backwash to
a depth of two feet, I then found some of Dick's descriptive
adjectives quite handy.

A few moments later, Ed, and Lew were with us and we began to
make our way toward the entrance. A welcome disc of light appeared
in the passage ahead--then two--then a dozen. The next thing I
knew, we were surrounded by cavers from VPI and Uva. They took
it from there.

Gary: Another patrol car met us north of Lewisburg and guided us
to the road that leads to the Snedegar's entrances. The troopers
told us that another patrol car was already searching along the
road for Ed's car and would radio back immediately if they found it,
Our group decided to take one car on in and leave two at the inter-
section to await Uva's group. After getting directions from one
of the officers, five cayers and one extremely low-slung Buick
Special started out..

Snow had fallen since Saturday and still covered most of the
back roads. The one we faced a few minutes later was no exception.
One lone set of tire tracks showed that the patrol car had preceeded
us,
A slow approach didn't work--the rear wheels lost traction
on the first upgrade. I backed off and headed as fast as possible
for the dirt road and somehow kept going--sliding, skidding,
spinning down that winding, nerrow excuse for a road.
We spotted Ed's and Lew's cars at almost the same instant
that we spotted the patrol car. One of the patrolmen was. radioing
the discovery to the group waiting at the intersection. The other
was talking to one of the locals who knew where the entrances were.
