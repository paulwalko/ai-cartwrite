carabiner rappels, single brake bars, and every other type of
rappeling device. These accidents were caused by inexperience,
errors in judgement, or violation of simple safety practices, and
not by the inherent characteristics of the rappeling method.
None of them could reasonably be used as a reason for condeming
a particular method. We have all seen close friends killed in
auto accidents, Are we about to condem the avtomobile for the
human misuse of it? In his efforts to keep cavers out of hospitals
and: graveyards, Pete is badly missing the point when he attacks a
single rappeling method.
Ilost of the more rewarding human activities can be dangerous
in the hands of foolish or inexperienced persons. This includes
rappeling, caving itself, skiing, automobile driving, canoeing,
mountain climbing, swimming and many others. All of these activities
inyolve the use of judgement and skills which must be patiently
taught and carefully practiced. Only then can these activities be
entered in safety. During my early months of caving I received the
best instruction available. Older and wiser cavers prevented me
from attempting the too difficult too soon, I have rappeled with
the single brake bar for over four years, having tried all the .
popular methods and picking this one as my favorite. I have never
had an accident with this device, nor have any of the cavers to whom
I have taught it.* This does not mean that the SBB is, by its
nature, danger free. It simply means that it is quite safe in the
proper hands.
It must be said of Dick Sanford's articles that they are in-
complete. Surely Dick would admit this himself. A complete treat-
ment of the broad subject of rappeling would require volumes,
He skipped lightly over the subject of belays, both overhead and
prusik, without which there can be no safety on Iong rappels. But
his subject was rappeling hardware, not the safety assessories
which are used with them. Also, some of Dick's statements are his
opinions and could be subject to debate. For instance, I would
not consider rappeling without gloves. Also, in my oin opinion,
the SBB should always be performed with the rope behind the caver,
across his seats, for the very reason given by Dick. And I would
never recommend the use of a belay from below because of the danger
of falling debris. But these are all matters of personal opinion
and it is senseless to extol one's own methods and attack everyone
elses. In short, Dick's auticalsthough very good, bear room for
some discussion and differing opinions. But I think Peter Grant's
remarks are overly critical and one-sided.
*Note to Pete Grant: I am not especiall'strong and hardly possess
the "Herculian strength" which you describe as necessary to operate
the SBB rappel,
