THE CASE AGAINST BELAYS
Firsti, let me say that this is a difficult article to write
so that it will be understood by the very peapIe who will oppose
itta These: will probably be people who have no faith in human :
judgementt, and believe that only a strict set of rules will counter-:
act innat√© fallibility. So they set forth a list of safety rules
whichi, must be adhered to strictly or else. Then along comes a guy
who wants to see a cave rather than ido a cave. Immediately he
is labied as Funsafe, because he ignores the ironbound rules and
applies His own mature judgement and experience to each particular
situation. Actually, he could be just as much if not more safetty-
minded than the next guy. This brings us to what seems to be the
Hottesti area of dispute over safel vs. Hunsafet caving practices:
Ho belay or not; to Belay .
I have read several lists of safety rules for vertical caving,
and they all seem to include some specific cases in which a Belay
must be used. A typical example may read: An overhead belay
shall always be used on the first person dawn a rope and" by people
with limited experience irr vertical caving." I will refrain from
devuIging the source of this statement, and will cast no aspersions
theream. However, I will citte several eyamwitness accounts of its
brilliant application.
#1 --Several years ago a group of three experienced vertical :
cavers and two with limited experience. were prepairing to rappel
intto Hell Hole (Pendleton County, West Virginia). They were iriwa?
formed by a person who had been in the cave before that the piti
was 160.1 deep, SO E.P.D., the trip leader, decided to use a 1701
lengtih of rope as a balay line. R.E.W., an experienced vertical
caver, was selected to make the first descents so he was given a
beliay: Always, ane to enjoy a long, free drop. R.E.W. The S descend-
ing rather rapidly until about 20 feet off the floor, he was.
braughit: to a nib-crushing stop. His helmat flew off, and he lost
his: grip on the rappell rape. He spun helplessly like a run-dawn
yQ-yo, Obviously, the belay rape was too shorthio Only by a max-
imum effort: Was E.P.W. able to loosen the rope and allow R.E.W.
to continue his descentio However, Mr. Wis bruised ribs and Sore
neck lasted for days to come.
#2--On this same trip were two cavers with minor experience,
so they were giverr a belay in accordance to the rules. The overly-
cautious neophytia descended so slowly that the belay rope wound
itself around the rappel rope as he spiraled down into fred space
About half way dowring the friction between the two ropes became so
greate that he was unable to continue his descente, Fortunately,
R.E.W. Was at; the bottom and was able to correcte the situation
by running in a large circle with the end of the rappel rope, thus
urrwinding the two so the: neophyte could finish his descenti
These are the two most potentially serious occurances which I
have witnessed. I also heard of" a case in: Higganbotham's #1 in
Tazewell County, Virginia, where a belay rape dislodged a shower.

to use a belay.
