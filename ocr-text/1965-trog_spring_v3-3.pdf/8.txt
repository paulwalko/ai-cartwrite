(6). Buchanan Saltpeter. Cave (Smyth County) Here is a real
suprise, but Douglas quotes W. Stephenson, (1948) in the descript-
ion; "about 2.5 miles of passage.". The map doesn't quite bear this:
outs however.
(7) Crossroads. Cave (Bath County). The total length of mapped
passage is approx. 2 miles" quotes Douglasa: 'The map seems to con-
firm this.
(8) Luray Caverns (Page County) There is always a great deal...
of uncertainty surrounding the actual extent of a commercial cave,
A quote in Douglas says; "The total length of all passages will
not exceed 2 miles, L. H. Durloo. How's that for vagueness?
That statement could be applied to quite a few caves smaller than
the ones listed below.
(9) Porter's Cave (Bath County). Douglas says There are 8,500
feet of passage..." An accurate map by "Iolsingor & others seems to
verify this.
(10) Clark's Cave (Bath County) Douglas quotes: llmore 'than.
8,000 feet of passage, ".-J. Iolsinger and R. Detterman. ..
(11) Endless Caverns (ockingham County) The actual length is
not publicly knovin, buth the commercial tour is 7,000 feet in length.
Since the tour doesn't cover nearly all of the cave, the cave may
possibly rank 'ligher. Does anyone have any higher estimates? .
(12) Iew River Cave (Giles County) Cver: 6000 feet have been...
mapped by Bill Grenoble and others of the VPI Grotto. Sore remains,
but nothing significant.
(13) Stonley's Cave (Tazewell County) This cave was a real
problem to classify. Annroximately 6000 feet was mapped by the
TPI Grotto in 1960, but it was maped by brunton and pacing.
shall rank it thirteenth, since I ranked l'evberry's and iller's
Cove fairly high.
(14) Clover Tollow Cave. (Giles County) This one just barely
males it as a mile-long cave, .
That's about it for caves of over a mile long in this state.
Does anyone have any new inforriation? It would be interesting to
compile a list of Virginia's largest coves based on accurate surveys,
but one can easily see the lack of standards that would be involved,
such as accuracy of survey, reliability of source, etc. .
A list such as the one published here could never be accepted
as a final ranking until ali caves were completely and accurately
surveyed. ven then, Ã  complete map of each cave vouldii't provide
the final inforria tion. The actual footage must be computed directly
from the survey notes. Feanwile, this seems like a good question :
to arg??e about: Vrite us if you have nore informa tion.
