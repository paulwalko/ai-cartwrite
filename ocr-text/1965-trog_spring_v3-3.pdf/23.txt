Prusiking, with three points of support, needs no extra safety
device. The main rope has been tested by rappeling and has there-
fore stood up under forces much greater than prusiking will pro- .
duce. Careful attention to the condition of the chest prusik and
the foot prusiks will eliminato the possibility of a prusik broak-
ing, making this method of ascent one of the safest.
Ladders increase in usefulness as the size of the caving group
grows, Ladders are faster for most groups, since the time required "
to rig in for the climb is much less. Their major fault is that
it is easy to slip off. Belays, therefore, are a near necessity
when using ladders.
Cavers also use belays on climbs and on difficult traverses.
The reliability of the belay depends upon the belayer. He
must have enough experience to correctly choose an anchor post,
belay position, and rope that are reliable. He must be able to
catch a falling person on both a static and dynamic bclay quickly.
and gently. As has been pointed out, the belayer has the advantage
of being able to calmly plan and act in the event of a fall, a feat
that the falling caver will find impossible to do.
I am not, nor will. I ever be, a hidebound follower of rules.
There will always be situations for which general rules should not
apply and the same is true in the use of belays.
Belays, though they are independent, reliable, versatile, and
efficient, may easily become nuisances in many situations. There
are places where it is impossible to riga belay, there are other
places where belays are unnecessary. Their use at any time is, and
should always be, left to the judgement of the individual cavers.
Used correctly and sensibly, belays will add to the safety and
enjoyment of caving.

(Editor's Note: The two preceeding articles were written by
Whitt and I to point out, as the titles stated, the cases for and
against belays. We did not collaborate while writing them; in
fact, we did not even read each other's articles until after they
had been stenciled. This kept us from wasting time and space in
debating each other's arguments and made it easier for us to stick
to the main purpose of the articles: Presentation of the advantages
and disadvantages of belays from two different viewpoints,
