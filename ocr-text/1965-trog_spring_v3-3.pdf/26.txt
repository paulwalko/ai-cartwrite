TRIP REPORTS
TRIP TO TAZEWELL
by Byron McCutchen
Personnel: Craig Peters, Gary M°Cutchen, Addison Wilkins,
E.B. Baker, and J. E. Waid
A group of six cavers left Va. Toch about 2:30 p.m., on a cold,
windy afternoon and headed southwest for Tazewell, Vā. Our objec-
tive on this trip was an expedition to Stonely's Cave and the
checking-out of a previously found sinkhole.
The entrance to Stonely's is quite impressive, and consists of
a 20-25 ft. rock entrance, with a slanting entrance. There are :
trees surrounding the sink, but they provide no difficulty in
entering. Several water entrances to the cave are visible on the
surface, and one has a possibility of entrance, with some digging,
There is no stream in the entrance passage, however. We decided
to head for Tazewell and get some food before returning to tackle
Stonely's.
At Tazewell, we enjoyed the many-splendored pleasures of cafe
eating. Much to our joy, the cafe we chose had several cute (?) ""
waitresses who provided great enjoyment for all. Ed. Note: Write
today for rules to VPI Grotto newest game, "Waitress Baitingi"%
It should be mentioned, however, that Craig Peters was the object
of fascination for thom, and it was his attractive forces that con-
tinually forcod them to approach us. We all ordered King hamburgers
and fronch fries or onion rings. After completely gorging our-
selves, it was time to do some caving.
Wo piled into the car, and rode to the farmer's house that
had been visited on a previous expedition. Here we were entertained
and enjoyed talking with the farmer, as well as his daughters, who
were also attracted to Craig Peters. It must be that pipe. Por
perhaps his red tie?).
We changed clothes in his basement, and spend 15 chilling
minutes in five-degree weather searching for a sinkhole. We finally
located it, and found it filled with trees and brush, which made
rappeling quite difficult. We back-rappeled in, and found it to
be more than we expected - nothing. It was actually forty foot of
nothing. Disgusted and cold, we emerged, and found our way to the
warm basemont of our friendly farmer. After resting, eating, and
changing, WC pushed onward.
We arrived at Stonely's about an hour later, and entered the
cave about midnight. We took the right passage, and wired a ladder
in the slope that fell on a slant for twenty foet. It was an easy
ladder climh, and we were soon viewing the large number of bats 10-
cated in the entrance passage. We pushed on back, finding many
streams, a couple of watorfalls, and many sinking siphons. The cave
requires a great deal of crawling, and if one desires to get wet,
it holds a great deal of passage. We, however, elected to remain
dry, so saw very little of the cave. There are a number of formations
and two levels, with a number of leads. There are some excellent
