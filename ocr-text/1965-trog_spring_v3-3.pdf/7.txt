VIRGINIA'S BIG CAVES
. I knew before I wrote this article that it would cause no end
of strife, mainly because true facts are harder to find than I.
thought they would be, and many of these are disputed. However,
I decided to publish it anyway in hopes that a few angry and/or
informative letters would clear up some of the mystery surrounding ::
several of the caves involved, and I could re-publish the article
in a future issue applying fresh information.

The purpose of this article is to set forth a list ranking all
major Virginia caves according to length of passage, Only caves of
at least one mile are represented, for obvious reasons. Most of
the information used came from the sometimes questionable accounts
in Douglas, even more questionable notes in the V.P. I, files, and
highly questionable discussions with other cavers. Since there is
such a great amount of vagueness in these sources, I will make no
apologies if I am incorrect in these classifications, and simply
state that errors are due to pure. ignorance, Here they are, in
descending order:
(1) Butler's Cave (Bath County) 10+ miles mapped, possible
13 miles known to exist. Not many people will argue with this;
Information via llike Hamilton,
(2) Breathing Cave: (Bath County). Estimates have run as high
as 8 miles, but the Mittany Grotto map only shows a little over 4,
miles,
. (3) Newberry-Bane's System (Bland County). Now the fun begins.
A note in the V.P.I, files, under the name Tom Bunker, says * 4.
milésil. A note by Larl Thierry says "Over 2 min of passages".
His map only shows about two miles, but a great deal more exists
in the area below the stradale pit, etc. If we only had Earl's
original survey notes, we could add another few miles to his map
and retain :3 status. Also, there are 3 distinct possibilities
of blasting open nore passages. Some people will disagree, but
Newberry's is third for the time being.
(4) Gilley's Cave (Lee County) Easily fourth, if not third.
In Douglas, Earl Geil is quoted in the description: "Over 16,000
feeto.. has been mapped, and close to 20,000 feet... has been ex-
plored." This cave just goes to show the possibilities offered
by Southwestern Virginia.
..(5) lliller's Cove Cavė (Roanoke County) I may be sticking
my neck out again, but I8ve seen the cave and believe that at least
3 miles exist, possibly more. A note in the V.P.I. files says,
119,000 feet on preliminary survey, 18,000 feet explored."
