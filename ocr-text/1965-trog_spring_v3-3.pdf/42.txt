GREENBRTER SYSTEM AREA CLOSED
The entire cave-riddled area surrounding Organ Cave in West Virginia, inclu-
ding 'the Greenbrier System, is now closed to all cavers.
The closing of Schoolhouse Cave was bad enough, yet cave after cave has been
closed as angry landowners finally react to vandal who call themselves cavers.
It is the first
This, the latest closing, is a portent of events to come.
time that an entire caving area has been placed off-limits.
One thing is clear; we cannot blame the landowners. They have been patient
and forgiving for years. Their wheat fields have been trampled, camped in,
driven through, and burned. "Cavers" have trepassed on their property and
entered their caves without permission. Farmers have been awakened late at
night by noisy 'cavers!! who arrived litoo late!! to ask permission, so didn't.
Cattle and sheep have died from carelessly dumped carbide.
And that's not all, Mrs, Sivley, owner of Organ Caye (One of the entrances
to and the only commercialized part of the Greenbrier System) reports that a
part. of the electrical system in the cave has been torn down by a group of
licavers who entered the cave without permission. Friendly and still spry at
an age when many can hardly walk, Mrs. Sivley is dependent upon revenue from
the cave for a living. She still conducts tours of the cave herself, but has
neither the energy or know-how to repair the lighting system. Without outside
help, Mrs. Sivley would have to close the cave.
If the cavers" who pulled down the lighting system read this, I hope they
feel very proud of their "daring" exploit. Does it give one a sense of accom-
plishment to try to put a widow out of business? Why not just drive up to her
house and rob her?
This type of action in the past has lead to the permanent closing of several
entrances in the area. Now, a crowning incident has occurred which has lead to
the closing of the area to all cavers. This began when a group of the same
breed of cavers" opened a blocked cave entrance without the owner's permission
and didn't even have the decency to close the cave back up. A calf wandered
into the cave and fell down a drop. The farmer, 70 years old, fell while trying
to rescue the calf. He is stillbedridden, three weeks after the accident. His
wife, an excellent shot, seriously intends to shoot any trespasser. Other land-
owners in the area are, at present, content to prosecute trespassers to the full
extent of the law.
While caving in the Greenbrier area has been limited for several years, rem
sponsible groups and/or cavers have been allowed in many of the restricted caves.
But now the situation is critical. Responsible cavers, who first worked the
area, are currently trying to establish a caving policy in the area. They be-
lieve that if all caving groups adhere to a non-caving policy in this area, that
the area may be opened in the future.
We are not only complying with this request, but are urging all other
grottos to do the same. While this publication reaches few independent cavers
and Boy Scout troops (whom we believe responsible for the majority of the van-
dalism), we hope that all NSS and Grotto members will heed this plead. Other-
wise, a great caving area will be lost,
