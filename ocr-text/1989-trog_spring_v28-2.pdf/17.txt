my breath back -- till I learned to relax as many muscles as I could short of not being
able to climb. At that point, my Mexican rope-mate began to fall behind because of
exhaustion; though he lived at S.L.P., 6500', he had considerably less experience on rope
than I, so was expending much more energy. I enjoyed the resting time which also
allowed me a better look at my surroundings. (To the Norte Americanos, the cave was
warm, even the water, while the Mexicans came out cold and dry, avoiding all the water
they could even though they had to expend considerably more energy to do so. Since I had
been in the cave before, I knew how warm it could be, so I had worn a long-sleeved
cotton t-shirt rather than my nylon suit. As I neared the top of the pit, the air became
fresher, cooler, and even gave me the illusion, at least, of containing more oxygen).
Finally, we arrived at the tail and I switched my safety (Petzel Expedition) over and
took off my chest harness. There was no need to do a complete change-over since the
friendly ledge was an easy long reach from where the main rope went up and over a
large boulder. I then discovered that my foot jammer had come off the rope as we had
been climbing against the wall. Juan understood English and soon moved up to re-attach
it. At this point, I should have checked the rest of my gear, but I was almost at the top
and people were waiting at the bottom to come up. Since there was not enough tension on
the tail to hold me upright, I would grab the tail, slide my safety up as far as I as I could
then hold onto the main rope as I climbed. With 20 feet to go, I grabbed the tail and gave
my safety a push, and it kept on going out of reach as the quicklink (maillon-rapide)
went tinkling down the rock face. (The group below heard it land, but could not find
anything).
So there I was, 700 feet up, ready to do a heel-hang against the wall, and my rope-
mate was probably too tired to help me out of it! I looked for ways to one-handedly
attach myself back to the rope. Twenty feet was not far to go, but I couldn't help
thinking of where I had come from. I worked myself up within a couple feet of the
ledge. Juan had to push away from the wall because I could only afford one hand to move
my knee and foot ascenders. Luckily, I had put my pack on a longer tether than I usually
do and was able to throw it up over the ledge (it stayed!) I removed a biner from the
tether, (we had all gone in light; after all, we were only going into the pit and so had
little extra gear with us), hooked it onto something as I fumbled for the safety rope,
finally getting myself safely engaged to the tail. A couple more steps and I was able to
disengage my foot ascender, step out and over onto the ledge while hanging tightly onto
that safety line I had worked so hard for. A couple more moves and it was time foe
Juan to make his uneventful exit from the rope. (There were two Mexican cavers sitting
a couple of hairy climbs above the rigging. When we called earlier to ask them for help,
they could not come because they were both without lights. Apparently, because of their
lack of equipment in general, the policy (followed too often even in the States, that is,
counting on your companions as your other two sources of light) is common with these
cavers because it was easy to walk or climb through the cave, meeting up with someone
who was waiting for "another source of light" -- possibly you -- to arrive).
The last push crew and survey crew were sent in Wednesday evening with the
expectation that they wouldn't be back up for 24 hours or so. They were both to bottom
the cave if possible, survey and bring up the ropes from all the shorter drops -- over
3000 feet of rope -- to the bottom of the big drop where they would be tied, together,
pulled up the 715', and snaked out of the cave. Some of us tried to get a nap Thursday
evening since the word was out that 10:00 p.m. was worktime. Speleo Babe came loping
up the hill at just about that time, after climbing the 715 in less than 30 minutes (he
claimed 13 minutes and no one will dispute him) after 24 hours in-time and announced
that the cave was ready for rope removal. He then removed himself to bed.
