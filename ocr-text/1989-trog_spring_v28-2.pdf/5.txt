GROTTO GRAPEVINE
Heeeewack! Time for another dose of the low-down on the Cave Club membership.
The last grapevine was printed only four months ago, so while there is not as much
material to go into THIS grapevine, none of that material has been lost because of the
solvent effects of beer on memory!
We start on a sad note-four friend and former secretary , Dougo Bohn, has retired
from student life. His disorganized style in performing the duties of secretary, his
antics during club meetings, his esprit de caving, and his hair grease will live in the
memories of all who knew him. He will be missed by us VPI cavers, and especially by
the special friends he made in a Montgomery County jail cell.
The now-annual Christmas trip to Mexico took place again this year with Cecile James
and Doug Abernathy representing VPI. Besides exploring a few known caves, the group
went ridgewalking and discovered some other promising holes. Before Cecile returned
to the U. S., she sold her vertical rig to one of the Mexican cavers. She then left Mexico
in such a hurry that she forgot to fill her truck with gas. They crossed the border under
human power. In March, Cecile, Maureen Handler, and several non-VPI cavers returned
to Mexico to follow-up on the leads that were discovered over Christmas, and to sell
more vertical equipment to the Mexicans.
With the new year, The VPI Cave Club changed its name. It is now VPI Chapstick er,
ah, oops ... (drum roll) ... The Cave Club of VPI. Since the last Grapevine, we have
seven new members: Brian Cruikshank, Dave Warren, Mike Sziede, Kat Teten, Lesley
Colby, Mark Eisenbies, and David McElroy. We were especially pleased to vote Kat in,
since she had been a trainee-scum for 17 months. Dave Warren calebrated his new
status by drinking himself comatose and spent most of his membership party unconscious
on the couch.
Joe Uknalis, (another long-time trainee) chaired the banquet committee this year, and
deserves much credit for a job well-done. 115 people attended the banquet, socialized,
ate, listened to Horton "Bugs" Hobbs III talk about caving in Costa Rica, and cringed lest
they be recognized at the infamous awards ceremony.
And the awards follow: Philip Balister got the "Rim of the Ancient Mariner" award
in which the toilet he blew up with a bottle rocket was chained around his neck for all
eternity. Glen Davis was designated the club's PW, for spending his time with Alice
Lane when he should have been at club meetings. Ed Devine was presented with a loaf of
bread so that he would have some use for the seven toasters he and Linda got for their
wedding. Mike Futrell, Paul Kirchman, Dave Schantz, Dave Cinsavich, Richard "Dick"
Cobb, and Philip Balister all received fig leaves for real or imagined acts of public
nudity. A special thanks to Beth Wichterman for helping to get the fig-leaf sizes right.
The feminists were given a chance to prove that they could be as brave as any man when
a spare fig leaf was found, but none did. Let the record show that they had the
opportunity.
Ben Keller was recognized for his ability to inarticulate under pressure with a public
speaking award. Doug Bruce received a plastic compass and whistle set--disposable
survey gear to replace the equipment he left on the side of the road following a mapping
trip to Stay High Cave. Kay Johnson was awarded Armchair Caver of the Year, and
although she might protest that she DID go caving once this year, that was as the plastic
victim at the practice rescue, so most of the time she was being carried around by
trainees. Richard "Boo" Croft received a special academy lifetime achievement award:
the wheelchair caver award, for being an armchair caver for so many years. Jim
