A large number of VPI personnel went on the annual Alabama trip over Spring Break.
Those new to Alabama couldn't believe that their first campsite was REALLY a dump.
At least there was a panty rock. The annual JMU Spring Fling took place in 20-degree
weather and snow. As usual, VPI outnumbered JMU, but the weather kept us from
asserting ourselves in the fashion that has kept us infamous there. Jim Washington's
annual Easter Beer Hunt was well attended, and was great fun for the kids (who got to
hide and find the beers) and the adults (who got to drink them.)
That's it for this edition of the Grapevine. Remember, mention in the Grapevine is
an honor that must be EARNED. Don't wait until the last minute to screw-up. Do it
before midnight tonight! (But cave softly and safely.)
GCCS Update:
All the GCCS That Fits, We Print
The caves of Giles continue to astonish and amaze. We are still finding new ones, and
even the old ones that are still there are kind of neat.
The Stay High Cave survey is stalled until warmer weather. All that seems to be left is
upstream infeeders best left until the summer. But it is the state's newest mile-long
cave, with 5748 ft. of passage as of the last survey trip in January.
Mike Futrell has been back to Yer Cave recently and is still finding more stuff. As of
this writing, the survey has 13,200 ft., tying it with Miller's Cove as the 18th longest
cave in the state.
Ridgewalking has turned up several known and unknown caves:
Cecile James, Lesley Colby, and Jim Washington started a resurvey of Virginia Cliff
Cave #3, which has over 500 ft. of mostly dry, walking passage. Jim, Joe Uknalis, and
Richard Hunter went to complete the survey, couldn't because someone forgot the
sketching equipment, but found #2. and #1.
Cecile and Jim resurveyed Daisy Williams Caves #1 and #2.
crawlways with evidence of recently being a fox den.
These are mostly dry
Barry "Pyro" Fizer, Barbara Graham, Rob French, and Jim Washington opened up two
new caves in the Clover Hollow area. One of them has a 25-30 ft. pit entrance 8 inches
wide and has some air. Further exploration will have to be done by the GCCS Munchkin
Squad. The other cave has a larger, horizontal entrance that leads to 20-30 ft. of
passage ending in a dig.
Doug Bruce, Mike Horne, and Frank Kadel went to look for Phlegar's Cave. It wasn't .
there; instead, there is a new quarry. Add yet another cave to the list of missing caves.
Since the last Trog, GCCS has added nearly another mile of surveyed passage to the
survey, mostly in Yer Cave (thanks, Mikel) And there is still a lot to do.
