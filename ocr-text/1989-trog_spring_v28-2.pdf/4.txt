Â· Editor's Column
Aaaaaaaaaaaaagggghhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!
I'm giving up.
I have mixed feelings about this.
Really.
On one hand it's a relief.
Real Editors
you see,
don't get copy in five page
one paragraph
unpunctuated
clots.
They don't wake up at night.
with nightmares about
The Syntax From Hell.
(I'm going to get you, Cecile.)
But then again,
Real Editors
don't usually get away
with Editor's Columns like this
or hiding
snotty comments
in other people's articles.
I feel good about this.
Really.
Even though I always ended up
putting in an extra 40 - 60 hours
during the last week of classes.
I feel great about this.
Really.
It was an experience.
I learned a lot
and now I can
word process
cut 'n paste
bribe typists
and get a buzz from White Out
with the best.
This is wonderful.
Really.
I'm glad I could serve the Club
as Editor.
Thanks for your support
and compliments.
This support can take many forms
Brian Cruikshank, for example
wasted more than five
of his employer's hours
printing this issue.
Be nice to him
when he asks you for a handout
in the future.
I'm estatic.
Really.
? But I really can't do this again
Not even if you
strapped dynamite
to my face.
One final note
to Joe and Kay
(The kindly Editors to be)
Good luck with the upcoming Trogs
You'll need it.
Really.
