A Bedtime Story for Budding Cavers
Let me introduce you to Mike and Tom. They were brothers in the Stalagtite family.
Yes, that's correct -- those cave formations we take for granted as just hanging off the
ceiling. They had a large family, parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles. Mike and
Tom were only a few hundred years old -- young for a stalagtite. Their grandparents,
however, were much older and larger. The family lived in a fairly small room with 20 -
25 other stalagtites
After waking up, Tom and Mike decided to have some fun. They went to climb the
wall in their yard. They were up it in seconds, and afterwards they joked about how
clumsily the disruptive giants climbed the wall.
Mike and Tom then ventured to neighboring lands where they could relax in a pool of
refreshing water. You see, they could bulid up and grow both from the nutrients in the
soil, and also from the minerals in the water. They found the small pools gleaming in the
darkness, and after relaxing for a while, they had a splashing free for all.
They got up and walked around for a while and met a new friend. His name was
Brian. Brian complained that he was aroused from his sleep by a blinding light. The
giants came in after the light and took him from his resting place and dropped him on the
ground. He was now in the process of fleeing to a new room to sleep. Mike and Tom
wished him good luck and went their way.
After a few more hours they heard an alarming crash that shattered the placid cave
atmosphere. Giants! They ran for their lives. They hoped to make it back to their home.
Stalagmites, you see, have a built in defense mechanism from giants. If they can make it
home, they hang on their ceiling and stay very still. They hope this will keep the giants
from damaging them.
Well, Mike and Tom ran as fast as they ever have. Mike had just reached his spot to
play possum when a glare of light pierced the darkness. Tom realized that he would not
make it and played dead on the floor. The giants entered the room and jabbered on in
some strange language. Eventually, they became bored, and moved on.
Very soon, though, Mike and Tom heard a harrowing scream from a giant. Curious to
see what had happened, they moved closer. They discovered that the giant had been
drinking and had just started a fire. Realizing how dangerous a fire was in a cave, Mike
and Tom went to work.
Tom quickly scaled the wall and jumped into the middle of the gathered giants. As he
crashed to the floor, the giants got scared and fled from the room. Mike and Tom were
happy they saved the cave, but this feeling did not last for long.
On their trip home, they noticed shocking scenes. Some of their stalagmite friends
lay dead on the floor after being maliciously knocked off the ceiling. Not only had the
smoke from the fire stunned bats, but the soot created much damage. Paint ruined the
natural beauty of the walls. And the refreshing rimstone pools were muddy and dying
from the crushing footsteps of the giants.
The End.
The moral of this story is that you should treat a cave like someone else's home.
Even if you don't mean to, careless actions often destroy valuable things. Remember,
Don't Be Like the Giants!
