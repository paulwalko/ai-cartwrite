JINXED IN LINKS
The sun poured in through Jim Washington's kitchen window. Wrapped in my
bathrobe, I was having a good cup of tea in my favorite sunny yellow mug of Jim's. It
said, in red letters, "I'M GOING TO HAVE A GOOD DAY." And I was. I was going
caying in Links. Going with me were club members Jim Gamble, Mark Eisenbie,
several assorted trainees and a friend of Jim's, Kathy. Kathy had never been in a cave
before. Jim had seemed relieved the night before when I had agreed to go. He didn't want
Kathy to be uncomfortable, being the only woman. I smiled. Kathy had nothing to worry
about. I would be there for her. She would probably be a little nervous and scared, but I
would soon put her fears to rest. I saw myself explaining how stalactites are formed
while Kathy looked on in awe.
"Aren't you ready yet?" It was the Babe Magnet. I was late. Fortunately, I was
already wearing my lucky cave underwear. I rushed upstairs and wormed into my
specially-ordered lavender Arctic-weight long-john set. I'd be ready in no time. I
struggled into my pink plastic jumpsuit. Next came the red hirt, the hideous purple
popcorn-knit wool vest, and joint pads for knees and elbows. I tend to get cold easily. I
looked out on the porch. Everyone was standing there waiting on me. They weren't
sitting around comfortably, and they weren't cracking jokes. They were just standing
there.
I applied several layers of socks and a painter's coveralls. After I tied a florescent
puke-green sweater around my neck, stuffed quilt batting into my chest, and forced my
inflated feet into cave boots, I was off. Six people stood on the porch and watched as I
scrabbled through my gym bag.
"Do I need this? Do I need that?" They all began walking up the hill while I
frantically tried to locate gloves, gear, lights. Everyone seemed so... together. Even
Kathy. I began to feel out of control as I gasped for breath ascending the hill by Jim's
barn. Little did I know that even my lucky underwear was not going to save me.
We entered the cave, and everything went fine for awhile. I frolicked, innocent of
the horror to come. And then we arrived at the canyon. My turn came quickly, and I
crawled to the edge of an enormous crevice. The far wall was miles away. The sides
were like freshly windexed glass. It was the edge of the world. The first two trainees
had apparently grown wings and flown across.
"I need a belay," squeaked a tiny voice from the back of my throat. There was a too-
brief pause while a belay was arranged and I crawled out again to the starting point. My
shaking legs began to shrink. The canyon walls expanded and I saw Hell below. I was
no longer human.
I was a gnome.
"No way," squeaked the gnome as it retreated, feeling slightly foolish in its cheery
matching puke-green belay line and sweater. The gnome felt as cheery as laundry lint.
Kathy stepped up to the ledge.
"I'll go on ahead," she asserted confidently. She turned into a gazelle and leapt across
with a perky flash of her little white tail. "Piece o' ca-aaake," she bleated.
I slunk down to the bottom of the impasse and struggled across in disgust. I had a
long chimney back up; meanwhile everyone in the party flew across the top and had to
wait for me again. By the time I joined the demons, a small waterfall of sweat was
erupting down the side of my face. I had more skins than an onion, and I was just as
slippery.
We chimneyed for several years. I could see Hell every time I looked down. We
