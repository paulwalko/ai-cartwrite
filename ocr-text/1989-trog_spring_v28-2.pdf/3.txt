Presidents' Column
(both of them)
We'd just like to mention that we were both too lazy to write our own columns, so we
took the hard way out and wrote this together.
This has been quite a semester for changes. First of all, there was the normal change
of "administrations," but there have been many others as well. First, the VPI Cave Club.
doesn't exist anymore. That is, by that name. We are now officially referred to as the
Cave Club of VPI (or Student Grotto of. VPI of the NSS -notice how VPI is now
affiliated with the NSS!). We had to change our name because of another (pending)
change, partially due to a new VPI&SU policy. This change is to incoporate the club, and
the VPI&SU policy is that no other incorporated organization may have the name "VPI
something." But enough of the boring changes.
The club has finally recovered from its people shortage. As. evidence, there was a little
more choice in this years elections than in the last few years. Paul Hess and Ed Fortney
put in a great effort to train the people who were crazy enough to stick around. It looks
like most are developing the obnoxiousness it takes to be a VPI caver, so Paul and Ed
have done a good job.
A number of these new members went to TAG with us (led by Ko -Ben couldn't lead
#@*%&). They survived the dump at Stephen's Gap, as well as the cold waterfall
(which Ed sat in for at least an hour). They also survived not taking showers for a
couple days until we hit the Sequoia Caverns KOA where moaning was heard from the
shower stalls. Over all, everyone had fun, and learned quite a bit about pit bouncing that
can't be learned in Virginia.
Now that Ko is president this is the last time I (Ben) and you (the reader) have to be
encumbered with my writing this column. Thanks.
