came to another impasse, and another. I was coaxed and bribed where no mortal had gone
before. Finally, I had no will to go on. I perched on an indentation made in the canyon
wall by someone's claw and refused to budge. Mark Eisenbie was dispatched to babysit
while the party continued to the end of the canyon, doubtless to chant and make human
sacrifices of other poor slobs they had enticed there. Mark was a considerate kind of
guy. He changed into human form so we could converse for the several decades they
were gone. He hmmmed sympathetically and I tried to recover as the sweat congealed all
over my puny, wasted, gnome-like body.
"I've been sick all winter," I offered, when my legs had stopped vibrating.
"Hmmm-hmmm."
"I haven't been caving since last fall. And I have no aerobic capacity," I continued.
Suddenly the cave temperature dropped 1000 degrees. Hell had frozen over. Goose bumps
began chasing each other under my damp clothes.
Fortunately or unfortunately, I wasn't sure, they came back before I died, and we set
about making a return. I promptly succumbed to terror when forced to re-negotiate the
macabre chasm of death.
"She's stuck again, Jim," the call went out.
"I'm coming, I'm coming," relayed the Babe Magnet with just a touch of
incredulousness in his voice. Obviously no previous victim had survived this long As he
approached I noticed the wonderful length of his limbs. His legs went on forever, and his
arms were just as long. He was as graceful as a spider. In fact, he was a spider. A
good-looking spider.
The arachnid spoke. It proposed I use it for a stepping stool.
"Go ahead, I'm firmly wedged," it assured me from underneath. I scrambled over
Jim/The Spider, with all the glamour of a limp dishrag. My wrinkled little gnome limbs
trembled as I cheated Hell again. And again. And again.
Let us draw the curtain of oblivion over the rest of our story. Suffice to say, at long
last, I blinked in the brightness of day. My body was my own. We made our way back to
the farm where my companions began to dress by the side of their car. I trekked after
them and brandished my trip sheet.
"Do you mind if I get dressed first?" Jim asked. He bore no likeness to a spider. He
was just an ordinary college guy in plaid boxer shorts, struggling to get his jeans on
quickly in the cold air.
"Oh, let me do it, let me," squealed Mark, "I've never signed anyone off before! Oh,
goody!" He began to write, crossed something out and wrote again. As I took my
notebook and started back, Kathy was overcome with curiosity.
"Did he write all kinds of stuff, about what a good caver you are, and all?" Kathy
obviously didn't think I deserved any praise.
"No0000," I said slowly, "He didn't take that route."
I thought I heard a cackle as I walked away. Mark had written, tactfully, "She swore
she would never cave again at every hairy spot in the canyon, but quickly took it back
when she got out."
My body was the worse for having been inhabited by a gnome. I longed for a hot bath,
and would have had one if Doug Dodd had not been thawing dead rats in the bathtub. Well,
actually, they were in an industrial-size bucket in the bathtub, so I shouldn't have minded,
really. Call me prissy. I settled for a shower.
"You really should go back and do that thing again," Doug Bruce said later, "It will be
much easier."
"That will be the day," I declined with a polite snort.
I wasn't ready to admit it yet. But I had already stood under a twinkley, winkley sky
