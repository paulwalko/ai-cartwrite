Caving... Why?
From the home office in Huntsville, Alabama, we have this issue's Top Ten List:
The Top Ten Reasons Why Cavers Cave.
10. Weather -- nice and warm in the winter, cool in the summer. Who says the cave
stays 54 degrees year-round?
9. Climbing a waterfall is an innovative way to take a shower.
8. A light coating of dust enhances the flavoring and texture of most foods.
7. "It's really cool... everybody's doing it" -- Jake and Elwood to a prospective trainee.
6. You get an oppurtunity to learn various knots which can be used for ALL SORTS OF
THINGS...
5. The feeling of wet, mouldy cave clothes is sooo good, and as Craig Roberts knows,
the smell can be nothing short of stunning.
4. You can annoy your roommate.
a. make and explode carbide bombs.
b. redecorate your room with gnarly equipment and a fine
coating of dust.
c. let your clothes ferment for weeks in a plastic bag.
"Huh? I don't smell anything."
3. Where else can you traverse a 50' chasm, 2 wider than your legs, just to find out that
it is a dead end?
2. It's a good way to keep your parents on edge.
Sample conversation between cayer and caver parent:
Parent: So, what did you do this weekend?
Caver: Well, Friday night I went to the Cave Club meeting and the party afterwards.
The party broke up kind of early, so a bunch of us jumped into the back of Brian's truck
and drove to the New River and tried to squash pennies on the railroad tracks as the
trains went by. By then, it was 4 AM so we figured we might as well stay up all night.
So we all drove to Phillip's house for a little visit, but he was asleep upstairs and we
couldn't wake him up even though we woke up a neighbor or two. So we broke into his
house and announced ourselves. Good thing he didn't have a shotgun, or we would have
been really suprised. We ended spending the rest of the night in the 'ice box' room. It
was cold. After eating all of Phillip's food and burning all of his wood and paper, we
finally left at... Oh, around 8 AM. Dave and I had promised to bring a bunch of people
from Pritchard caving, so we picked up the five of them and headed out to New River
Cave. Overall, it was a pretty average weekend. How about you?
Parent: (silence...dead silence.)
1. It's an excuse to drink alcohol. What else can I say?
