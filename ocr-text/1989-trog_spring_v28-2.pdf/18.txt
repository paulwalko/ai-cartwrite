We all dragged ourselves out, dressed for a long cold spell -- I already planned to take
the nearly unavoidable water, since I didn't want to go down the chute (or rather, to come
up the chute again) that day so I figured I should take another dirty job. (Later, I was
glad to be only wet and cold as I listened to the more than considerable grunting and
groaning as one after another tired body was dragged up the chute.). It was two hours
before someone indicated from the bottom that all ropes were up and it was time to pull.
We all took stations and with ease the rope was snaked through. The two pull crews at
the top of the big drop called for relief, and were replaced while the two rope watchers
climbed the 715'. Then, with great verve, the pit was cleared, the rope snaked past with
a beer can tied to its tail, and we all began our last climb out of La Borbollon -- at least
for a long time. I think all the cuevadoras and cuevadors had some sense of nostalgia as
they climbed out of that giant sinkhole to camp. It was 5:00 a.m. and the sky was
beginning to lighten around its edges as we fell back into our sleeping bags, this time for
an uninterrupted rest.
Friday a.m. we began the inevitable job of packing, organizing, and planning for our
exit, trying not to act too grumpy. Gerald and I, along with Alan Crestler, Marion Smith,
John Sullivan, Sherry Lydy, Speleo Babe and Baybette (okay, you spell it) snuck in
another outing to look and do more pits, and still get to S.L.P.d at 5:00 to meet at the
Motel for dinner. Carlos took us to Nicole's, a Mexican Pizza Parlor. The salad bar with
its uniquely Mexican vegetables was superb, the Vegetarian Pizza turned out to be a
vegetable pizza; all in all the pizzas were very good with a definitely unique Mexican
flavor. Back at the hotel, we all gave up partying for sleep with visions (or better yet, a
haunting feeling) of the straight through drive home and back to work.
The alarm went off at 5:00 a.m. and we were up and off, our only tourista shopping of
the trip at the rather nice hotel store after we ate breakfast. We enjoyed the
magnificent mountains on either side of the highway once again, were stopped for
inspection by a crew in heavy jackets with machine guns under their arms. In the desert
roadsides sat many natives selling anything that someone would buy, under small thatched
shelters -- snakeskins, birds, small animals, etc. We were slowed down at one point by
elaborately costumed Easter week revelers, bobbing and weaving, looking for pesos.
And not least of the sights were the flat bed trailers parked along the highway,
supporting seriously crashed cars splashed with "blood" and carying great banners
cautioning us, "Don't let the Grim Reaper win again!" And then the border where we did
the usual beer and liquor stops often as the vehicles moved slowly outside the Tiendes in
the line of traffic to the bridge.
At last, we had a very friendly border guard who thought we were funny and moved us
through. We found a place to sell our pesos so we can again buy vertical gear, of course
losing in the exchange. We went to a good place to eat cafeteria style (where Craig R.
deserted us four Xmas's ago to satisfy his Wendy's craving). The Canadians were
dropped off at the bus stop to find their way home however they could, and we entered
the Texas Wilderness. After several rotations of drivers, we pulled into a restaurant in
Mississippi for breakfast. I took the backseat, missed several rest stops and could not
be moved until we pulled into Chattanooga that afternoon. John and I decided to stay
over -- we all cleaned up and went to Bruce's new house for a delicious dinner, Gerald
left for Nashville and we turned in early. This time, the alarm didn't ring until 6:00
a.m. Seven more hours of driving for me, eleven for John. On arrival we unpacked the
truck and I discovered I had a client to see at my office in forty-five minutes, not even
time to shower........ And that's how that adventure ended!
