simultaneously standing on each other's shoulders to drive the next one in. The work
was slow, however, as we had to use the rock as a hammer. Soon our lights grew dim
for we were out of carbide and other light sources. In the dark we tied ourselves
together and continued our blind bolt climb. Each time Rob pounded in the third bolt, I
would remove the first so that we would have enough to reach the top. As we drew near
to the top of the pit, (judged by our dropping screeching bats tied to rocks down the pit
and counting the seconds) one of our bolts broke and we were forced to carry on, both of
us hanging from one bolt as we pounded in the other. The climb was not difficult as
compared to the rest of our journey to escape from the local cave, however. Eating a
diet of cold bat meat and Vibram shoe leather, we managed to crawl for many days until
we reached the entrance of the cave. Breaking out into the bright January sunlight, we
were met with the cold weather of a Virginia blizzard. Since we had not planned to be
teleported to this cave on our trip, we were forced to walk for two days back to
campus. The only casualties of the cold were our bare feet, for we had eaten our shoes
in the cave. Rob and I have learned many things in our cave trip experiences, but none so
valuable a lesson as this trip afforded us. From now on, Rob and I will be sure to pack
more than 2 candy bars in our cave packs, for neither of us like the taste of bat meat.
