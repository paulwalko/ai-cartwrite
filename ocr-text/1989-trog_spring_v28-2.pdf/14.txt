La Borbollon:
Trip report-March 16-26, 1989
The La Borbollon (pro-nownsed Boar-bee-yone') expedition was planned in early
January, 1989, while we were finishing up our two week Xmas-New Year holiday cave
and pit tour. We had just driven 2 1/2 hours (14 miles) from La Puente, stopping in San
Francisco, S.L.P. to do and find more pits when a group of Mexican cavers passed by on
their way to La Puente. They stopped and one member, Carlos Javier Zermeno P.,
stayed behind with us to set up a meeting for the next day to do La Borbollon -- a multi-
drop system with a deep drop several minutes from the entrance that two Mexican caving
groups had found the previous Spring and hadn't been able to explore fully. When we met
the next day we were asked to come back in the Spring so that those involved in the find
could join us. We planned to meet again in March, Holy Week, Le Semana de la Santa,
when most of the Mexicans have a week's vacation. We also exchanged gear for pesos
in the name of good-will and affirmation of intent and many of us came home needing to
set up new vertical systems.
The intervening time sped by, with missals from Maureen Handler, the expedition
leader of us U.S. and Canadian cavers. Carlos acted as the organizer for the Mexicans.
Word spread of the cave, attracting cavers from Colorado, New Jersey, Texas,
Tennessee, Toronto, and Virginia, 24 of us Northern types and more than 26 Mexicans.
John Sullivan of Richmond, Chris Stine of New Jersey and I left Blacksburg,
Thursday, March 16 at 1:00 p.m. with the Batrnnr so fully packed and topped off that we
had to remove the groceries (for 10 people for a week) from boxes to get them in. We
arrived in Chattanooga in the evening where we regrouped with Maureen Handler, Bruce
Smith and Gerald Moni and caravanned through the Southern states, getting to Nuevo
Laredo border crossing by late Friday afternoon. Everything went smoothly till the chief
Hefe's decision that the BATRNNR should be totally emptied of contents, and
subsequently repacked -- apparently he wanted to watch our frustration, since there was
no inspection of the contents once removed. Everything was replaced, of course gaining
more bulk while out of the truck. We kicked the back door shut again and stuffed items
in as the window was slowly raised (only two eggs were broken as the groceries were
tossed around).
We drove on to Monterrey to a motel that evening (we could not get to our camping
gear), and, the next morning, onto Cuidad San Luis Potosi, a city of 800,000, in the state
of the same name, carefully monitoring our gas tanks, and filling up with unleaded
(extra -- the silver pump) whenever possible. Being Holy week, EVERYONE was going
somewhere -- and the traffic was more than double that we usually see at Xmas time.
Luckily the road was wide so the average situation of 3 lane traffic on two lane
highways was actually relatively safe. We all convened at the Posada Motel outside of
S.L.P. with the other groups, ate together in the hotel dining room and stayed on and
partied, then went on to each other's rooms and partied. Finally, the decision was made
to sleep a few hours since we were to head for the cave and camping area at 9:00 a.m.
Sunday morning. At departure time Sunday, the mob was growing, the scene becoming
