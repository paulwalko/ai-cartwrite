Dr. Cavespeed
or
How I learned to Stop Worrying
and Cave With Phillip and Mike
Saturday, Mar. 4, Mike Fiore, Phillip Balister, and I went to Bane's (and a little bit
of Newberry's). I must say that this trip was one of my more, well... interesting cave
trips. Let Uncle Rob tell you the story.
The day started out something like this: I woke up at 8:30 to meet Mike at Newport
around 10:00. When I arrived, I found Mike gathering up his cave attire. "I'll be only a
few minutes; I've just got to patch up my cave clothes," he said.
We met Phillip at his house at 1:30.
We got to the cave and proceeded to rig the pit and descend. As I gathered up my stuff
and tried to fit it in my pack, Phillip says "When I was a trainee, we were trained by
men. If you weren't ready when they were, you were left behind," and proceeds to walk
off.
No problem, I thought. I can always catch up. Right.
The rest of the trip went something like this: Phillip and Mike speed down a passage,
stop, wait for me to catch up, when I try to rest, they head down the passage again, and
yes, the cycle continues.
We arrived at the Newberry's side and met up with Ed Fortney and his numerous
group of happy campers. When we left the group, we ran (literally) through the passage
that leads back into Bane's. Upon my asking the reason for our little sprint, Phillip
replied, "You must run to impress the other group. When we get out of sight, we can
slow down." I didn't see any difference between the two paces.
Now this is where the fun really began. Mike and I refused to go back through the
dusties, so, much to Phillip's dismay (because he is a water PANSY -- Eds. note) we
went through the chilly, but refreshing, water crawlway. Phillip made me go on ahead so
I could soak up all the water. After much intentional and revengeful misleading by a
certain grouchy member (Phillip), we arrived back at the pit. Mike proceeded to
assemble his ropewalker, get on rope, and nearly strangle himself. (Never, never, never
test out a bunch of modifications to your ropewalker for the first time at the bottom of a
70' pit with no alternative way out -- Eds. note) While waiting for him to untangle
himself, I wasn't too cold, and felt pretty amused by the fact that a member could
actually screw up.
I shouldn't have laughed.
My turn. I proceeded to tie my knots and start up rope. I got about three feet up when
a certain part of my body (my left nut) got caught in an unoppurtune part of my seat.
After my life finished passing before my eyes, after Phillip stopped laughing, and after
much adjustment, I made my way up the rope. Phillip climbed out quickly, and we were
(basically) out. An interesting trip, I must say.
