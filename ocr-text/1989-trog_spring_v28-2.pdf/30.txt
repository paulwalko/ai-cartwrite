back through that crawl to get out of here?"
"The end of the cave isn't far now, there's a point where the cave becomes vertical
and we turn back anyway. If you want, we can turn back here," Jeff said, intentionally
looking at Bill in order to get a response. Bill wanted to leave, Raymond wanted to go on,
and Alex didn't care either way; therefore, the group headed out by the alternate route.
Pulling a trashbag from his helmet, Jeff started to pick up some of the beer cans, old
batteries, and other assorted unpleasantness. Alex followed suit, striking up a
conversation with Jeff about cave conservation. Bill followed along with a blank look on
his face, while Raymond trailed at the rear not bothering to pick up anything at all.
The group then came to a room whose floor slanted sharply down to a drop of thirty
feet. At the far end there was a crawl which went to the entrance. Bill immediately
protested. "You said no more crawling, I want to go a different way!"
Jeff calmed Bill down, and then they left to cross the room and enter the crawl. In
case of difficulty, Jeff instructed Alex and Raymond to wait until he and Bill cleared the
crawl. After the signal came, Raymond started to cross the room, but slipped on the
smooth flowstone surface, stopping just inches away from the drop. Frantically, he
searched for something, anything to grab. Alex did not hesitate, immediately grabbing a
section of webbing and tying loops at each end. He shouted for Jeff's help, then told
Raymond to hold on.
He realized the webbing would not reach. Frantically, he searched for a solution. Part
of the way down the flowstone was a small stump, a salagmite, and a place where the
ceiling almost touched the flowstone, where he could place a foot and stop himself.
Sliding to the stalagmite, Alex found the foothold above him and put one of the loops
around the stalagmite. Raymond grabbed the other loop with a grateful exclamation, and
hung there as Jeff returned and took control of the situation.
Jeff secured a new line to Raymond. With two people hauling him up, it wasn't
difficult for him to get back to safety. Mumbling a few words of thanks, Raymond began
to think differently of the person who he had earlier made fun of. The enormity of how
much each person depended upon the others finally struck him; no matter how many
differences there are between people, these differences must not appear while caving.
Also, the belay was not something to be taken lightly, here just walking through this
room, a slip could have cost him his life. A passage or climb might seem simple enough,
but what if there were a slip? Deep in thought, Raymond hardly noticed the passing of
time. The group was now at the entrance. They exited into warm daylight once more.
After a while Bill said that he enjoyed everyone's company but he was too claustrophobic
to continue caving. And, except for apologizing to Alex, Raymond was mostly silent,
pondering the lesson of the trip.
