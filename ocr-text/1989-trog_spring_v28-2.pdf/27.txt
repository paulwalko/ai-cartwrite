Some Thoughts on Landowner Relations
Things happen. Usually all in fun, with results no more harmful than a ragged
hangover and and empty wallet from too much pizza. During the underground portion of
the trip there were perhaps mud fights, raunchy jokes, and other assorted debauchery.
Fun? Of course. Harmful? Assuming the cave was left pretty much as it was found,
surely not. Cavers are a wild breed, and I can think of no other group as inventive in
their merry-making! But we must ask ourselves: where will we draw the line?
Whenever we find ourselves out and about in cave country --be it in Mexico, out west,
T.A.G., West Virginia, or just in our own "backyard" -- we have to remember that we
represent all cavers. While it is easy to assume that we can anonymously act as we
please no matter where we are, this simply isn't true. Our bat stickers, helmets in the
car window, not to mention the places we "hang out" all act as a very visible means of
identification for the cave owners and other locals. A group of cavers on the side of the
road kitting up for a cave trip tends to be a memorable sight for those non-cavers
driving by. We need to try to visualize things from the local resident's perspective. Even
if those folks driving by don't own the cave, in rural areas it's a good bet that they know
the owner. To accidently offend or otherwise annoy anyone while being recognized as
cavers is simply inexcusable. Period.
It is essential to note that no matter where we choose to cave, we are the visitors, not
the guests. Just because we put our feet on the kitchen table at home doesn't mean that
it's 0.K. to act the same in someone else's kitchen. Several recent incidents seem to
indicate that perhaps some cavers need to give their attitudes towards landowner
relations a bit of a re-think. There are some things that, no matter how fun or "cool"
they may seem at the time suddenly become a lot less so when reports of cave closures
are heard. No, I'm not going to name names, or even specific details -- and let me be the
first to admit that I'm certainly not without my own "history", but let's try to perhaps
think things through a bit before we do something everyone will regret. As far as
landowners are concerned, caving is a privelege -- not a right as some seem to think.
We must start recognizing landowner rights and wishes, and the effects of our actions
on future trips... both ours and those of other cavers.
As I write this it occurs to me that perhaps some of us simply don't know any better.
This is, I suppose, certainly possible, and perhaps even forgivable -- IF THOSE
INDIVIDUALS TAKE THE TIME TO LEARN. Of course, every caver has his or her
own idea of what is acceptable, but allow me to make some suggestions:
1: ALWAYS obtain landowner permission before entering his cave, or ridgewalking,
etc. An open gate is not, repeat, is not an open invitation to enter someone's property.
Failure to get permission is at the least trespassing, and even more importantly, a sure
way to permanently destroy any chance of returning to finish work on whatever project
you or other cavers have going. The only exception to this rule is when it is a well-
known fact that the owner in question has given "blanket" permission, and doesn't want
to be bothered. Even if the owner always gives permission, cavers should set up some
mutually agreed upon form of communication with him. This could take on several
forms: a phone call the week before the trip, a note on his door or your vehicle or
whatever. Sure this takes extra time and can be a pain with a long-winded owner, but as
a way of building up his confidence in you, not to mention cementing your access to the
property, nothing beats it.
If you have any desire to ever return to a cave owner's property, "sneak-trips" are
