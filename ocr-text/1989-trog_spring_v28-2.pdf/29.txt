THE BELAY
(A Caver Fiction)
One morning group of cavers approached a fairly popular cave, known and traveled by
a large number of people, and having a fair amount of trash inside. The group contained
four people: Jeff, who was an experienced caver, Alex, with only a few prior trips, and
Raymond and Bill, both beginners. The entrance was obvious due to spray paint and a
heavily eroded path. Upon entering, the leader, Jeff, began to quickly summarize the do's
and dont's of caving, and gave helpful advice on starting the lamps. Proceeding past the
sunlight into the darkness, Jeff pointed out formations and passageways and some of the
history of the cave.
For Raymond, the beauty of the cave did not hold as much awe as did the challenges of
caving. To him, it was an adventure, risking the darkness with naught but a flashlight.
The idea of all the precautions seemed to somewhat dampen the sense of adventure.
Alex, on the other hand, had had a very difficult first trip, one fraught with the constant
danger of falling down several climbs that he found difficult. For Alex, the beauty of
the natural formations was as powerful a draw to caving as the difficulties of getting to
them.
As it happened, Raymond went down a difficult climb before Alex. He was instructed
to wait until the person behind him was down from the climb before proceeding. Alex
was being extremely careful, executing a well controlled descent and taking more time
than Raymond wanted to spend. Raymond waited impatiently, and then left with Alex to
continue following the passage. The passage started to form a canyon. At the end of the
floor, Jeff was braced between the two walls, a technique called chimneying, he
explained to Raymond and Alex.
Raymond was to go next. Bill had gone ahead earlier and was at the other side of the
passage twenty feet away, where walking was once again possible. Jeff asked Raymond
if he wanted a belay.
"A what?"
Jeff explained that a belay was a safety method using a rope to prevent falling, and
that if it was asked for it would not be refused. Then he asked once more. Raymond
was confident that he could do the section without problem, and began across. If he had
any problems, or fears, he did not show them after he had finished the climb. Alex, on
the other hand, wanted the belay. After Jeff rigged one up, Alex passed the canyon with
no problems. Afterward, Raymond expressed a few sarcastic comments to Alex. Jeff
immediately responded by saying that the small inconvenience of being safe is well worth
the luxury of remaining healthy. (Are we talking about caving or comdoms here? -- Eds.
note) Alex didn't say much, obviously the harsh words had affected him. Jeff noticed that
Bill didn't seem to be enjoying himself, and wondered how he could smooth things over.
Deciding to rest, the group munched on snacks in silence. Later, passing the area in
which they rested, a series of crawls had to be negotiated. For the most part, there was
enough space to move on hands and knees; however, there was a small stretch which was
tight enough not to allow passage with one's pack on. To the rear, Jeff heard Bill
struggling along, and asked, "how are you doing back there?".
Bill replied, "I'm a little stuck, I'm having trouble fitting through." Coaching Bill
through, Jeff realized that Bill was controlling claustrophobia, and definitely didn't enjoy
the crawl.
In a small room immediately after the crawl, Bill asked, "do we absolutely have to go
