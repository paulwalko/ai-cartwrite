shirt will go out of its way to find a rock on which to grab onto.
To avoid this, you can stuff any unused clothing into your pack. At this time, your
water bottle will suddenly explode, drenching your stored clothing. The odds of this
happening are increased tenfold if the temperature is below 32 degrees outside, and an
additional ten times if the article of clothing was necessary to keep you halfway warm
on the expedition back to the car.
Finally, Newton's Sixth Law of Caving: If you bring any thing worth more than $50
into a cave, it will soon become the property of A.1. Cartwright.
No how-to article on caving would be complete without a mention of a light source.
Namely, the "trusty," "dependable" carbide lamp. The normal working pattern of the
lamp has been discovered by numerous scientific experiments. The lamp will work fine
for the first five minutes into the cave. Then, as if commanded by some force of god,
the lamp will suddenly emit less light than the average match. No much how much you
fiddle with the lamp, this will not change. Then, upon leaving, the lamp will work fine
as soon as you get within ten feet of the entrance. (Unless, of course, it is dark
outside -- Eds. note) As for electric lamps, the same cycle applies, with the batteries
suddenly kicking in as you are about to leave the cave. Lamps are manufactured so they
wait until they can sense daylight before they start to work.
With all this said, you are now ready to start caving. You should now have a great
appreciation of the thrills, excitement, and underground spirit that makes caving the
INCREDIBLY AWESOME sport that it is.

My Experience as a Trainee
Blame Jake and Elwood for gracing you all with my presence; it was their idea.
Where else can we young, underage trainee types find such a ready source of beer? The
first meeting was an experience. Things like the news clip are a lot funnier after you
get to know the members. I still haven't figured out what Ben meant. Some analogy about
animals causing pollution or something.
Bridge sessions are one of my favorite parts of the Cave Club, even though after
three to four lessons on how to tie a helical I still can't get it right. Caving is a lot of
fun, but I never seem to be around when all of the good trips go out. However, the trips I
have been on were great, such as Links, especially in retrospect. There seems to be
more reward in it after you get out. I appreciate rocks more. I've also found it fun to
watch the old folks get trashed -- especially sweet, innocent Jim Gamble. You're a 75
and you know it!
I guess I should give fair warning to new trainees at this point. Cavers are not weird;
weirdness is relative. If Jim Washington asks you whether you want to go surveying or
ridgewalking, GO SURVEYING!!! Also, go to at least one major Cave Club party at Jim
Washington's if you are female. There are some interesting sights there.
Do not join a frat while in the Cave Club. My only excuse is that these guys will help
me with my engineering homework. Finally, always ask for a belay when you think you
want one. Capt. Ed was belaying me and saved my butt in the canyon section of Links.
For this, I am forever grateful. Hopefully, by the time I graduate from here, I will have
figured out that damned helical knot.
