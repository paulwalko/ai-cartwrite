to get up and see if you're back at 3:00 A.M. Midnight to 8:00 A.M. should be avoided if
possible.
G. Once you are back and everyone is safe and sound, a simple check in the "Back" column
is sufficient. You can leave a time if you want.
H. Leave a comment. Let us know how your trip went. Be creative.
Trips (Far Qut)
A. #1 rule in caving: NEVER CAVE ALONE!
B. Always let someone know where you're going and when you'll be back (sign-out sheet).
C. 3 people constitute a safe trip. (4 is even better so that no one caves alone)
D. Everyone going on the trip should be up to it physically and mentally. Here's a
judgement call. If you think someone isn't ready for a particular trip, tell them. Let people know
how hard you think a trip might be so they can decide for themselves. They can practice
techniques outside or gain experience in easier caves.
Ē. There is no max. # of people on a trip. Try taking 10 people to "Armchair Cave", and
then to the "Grim, Gross Pit of Death", and you'll get an idea of how many people you want on
your trips. Fitness and skill levels will differ. A trip is only as fast as its slowest member. (My,
that's profound!) You can always carry an extra duffel bag.
Techniques;
These here procedures should be followed down in 'da Earth.
A. Inspect ropes for glitches & frays.
B. Test all ropes and ladders using five people. Note: Some people who should know
advise that testing the new synthetic ropes has little effect. It can't hurt though.
C. Pad all tope rub points. Trees can usually be used as a change of direction with no
problem.
D. Tie a figure 8 on a bight at the end of the rope before lowering it down the drop. This
keeps you from rappelling off the end of the rope.
E. Friction wraps should be used when rigging so that the knot is not loaded.
F. Rigging should be inspected by all on trip when practical.
G. First person down should be an experienced member since no belay is available. A rack
should be considered.
H. Every subsequent rappeller should have a bottom belay.
I. Anyone who wants a belay, gets a belay.
J. Everyone climbing a ladder has to be belayed.
K. If your light fails, wait in place.
L. Avoid jumping.
M. Never leave a novice alone.
Addendum: The Safety Committee eagerly awaits similar guidelines as outlined by the Drinking
Techniques Committee.
