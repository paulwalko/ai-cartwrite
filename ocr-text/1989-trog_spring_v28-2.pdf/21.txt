Cave Club of VPI Safety Committee
Hey you CRAZY CAVE Dudes and Dudettes. Have you ever wondered what, like, are the
rules of the Cave Club? Well here they be. These are taken from the Cave Club Constitution
Standard Operating Procedures. Some of these rules may change, but in general, you should
always follow these guidelines. If you have any ideas or questions, let the Safety Committee
know. Party hardy and lets be careful down there!
Equipment:
* A. Helmet with chin strap -- non-negotiable. A MUST!
* B. 3 Sources of light. A carbide lamp is recommended as it gives off heat. If you use
electric, your carbide lamp can be a secondary light. A flashlight is a good third source. Make
sure you can hold it in you mouth or strap it to your helmet so your hands are free. Candles,
cyalume sticks and matches are good backups.
C. A pack is recommended to carry all your junk.
D. Carbide, dump bottle or bag, water and carbide lamp parts.
* E. Trash bag in helmet. If you have to wait, or you get lost, hurt, whatever, take your trash
bag out, punch a hole in the top, put it over your body and place your carbide lamp or candle
between your legs. You'll be toasty! Don't burn anything though. Remember: that's a large
trash bag, like for leaves and stuff. Lawn bags are great. Sit on your pack for insulation. Leave
your helmet on for head warmth.
F. 20-30 ft. of 1 in. tubular sling. For belays, handlines, arm rappels etc.
G. Food--candybars, gorp, Beanie-weenies etc.
* H. Boots with lug soles and ankle support. Tennis shoes are frowned upon. Warm
clothes. (Maybe a spare dry T-shirt in your pack?)
I. Certain trip specific EQ. For a vertical trip you'd need all this plus your vertical gear.
(Seat, gloves, rap, device, ascenders, ropes and pads.)
J. Don't forget your plastic ice cube rays.
*Sign-out sheet:
All Cave Club of VPI trips must be signed out. The sign-out sheet is posted at a local caver's
house and includes date, cave location, participants, time out, estimated time of arrival (ETA), time
back and comments. This is probably the most important safety aspect of the club. These
guidelines should be followed
A. Full names (First, last) of everyone on the trip. Nicknames are cute, but leave 'em at
home.
B. Phone number of trip leader (if new to club) and of any new cavers. This helps in
tracking down a trip if it forgets to sign in.
C. Cave location. Most caves we go to are well known and there is little question about
where they are. New or obscure caves present a problem in rapid mobilization in case of injury of
missed sign-out. Leave a map at the sign-out if possible. If you don't want your new cave
scooped, leave the map in an envelope.
D. ETA--This is the time you expect to be back by, with everything you do thrown in. If
you're not back by this time, we assume the worst. This includes leaving the sign-out, breakfast,
going to the bathroom, getting gear, driving, caving, getting cleaned up, drinking a beer, driving
home, drinking a beer, getting lost, drinking a beer, and signing back in.
Once your sign-out time is reached, a search party is sent out to find you. They'll try to call
you, but if you can't be reached there's no choice but to drag the cave for you. Be liberal in your
time allotment. Give yourself plenty of time to do everything and a little extra. Remember though,
help won't start coming until the time you list as ETA, so don't be too liberal.
E. Don't forget to sign back in! It is the first thing you do when you get back. Calling in a
sign-in should only be done if everyone is out of the cave. Missing sign-out ETA without injury is
punishable by one keg.
F. Sign-out & Sign-in times. Sign-out times are when you expect to be leaving town.
A.M. and P.M. are O.K. for ETA, but use noon or midnight instead of 12:00 P.M. or 12:00 A.M.
There's less confusion that way. Military (24 hr.) time is fine also. (i.e. 1:00 A.M. = 01:00).
Don't sign-out for a sign-in that is in the middle of the night. It's not fair to the sign-out dwellers
