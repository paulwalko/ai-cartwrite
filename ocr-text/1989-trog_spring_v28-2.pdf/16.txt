as the expedition went lower and lower. The final estimate was between 2100 and 2400
feet with a potential lead still at the bottom -- a near-sump would have to be drained. As
the water had been splashed away, passage was seen on the other side, but the crew was
tired and time was short. Twenty to thirty hour trips were the norm, with the long climb
near the top and several climb-ups above that, the reversing of the chute, a tall, tight
chimney, and finally "the squeeze" before the nice open cave passage up and around to the
entrance. It was quite a sight to watch the underground stragglers drag themselves up
the long, long climb up and put of the sinkhole and into camp. In addition, most of the
Americans were from lowlands in comparison to the 7500' altitude and our bodies didn't
let us forget it as we found ourselves gasping for breath after short climbs.
Each day, as the big rope was booked up for long periods of time with crews coming
or going from the bottom, those left on top found myriads of fruitful ways to spend their
time. Bruce Smith put into practice much of the theory in On Rope, encouraging less
experienced cavers to try out all kinds of equipment in the trees he had rigged and gave
them practice in setting up hauling systems. Others headed out of camp to drop pits in the
area. One popular one was Los Lobos, which was 650' deep, but then there were many
others ranging all the way down to the 40' Dead Dog pit where Maureen had stopped short
of a stinking carcass on our trip three Xmas's ago. Another popular pit was beautiful
Caclaterra, a twenty minute walk past the school and the village, 250', open and green,
filled with breakdown, ferns and the ubiquitous little burning nettle (called chichi-chichi
in Indian, which sounds very much like itchy-itchy). There was a red bud in bloom above
the pit, trees full of Spanish moss, and blooming bromeliads, giant-sized, everywhere.
I also had a couple of opportunities to visit the neighboring village where I was fed
whether I was hungry or not, and helped to wash my hair. Water is very scarce in this
area -- the village had a small reservoir for their drinking and cooking water and a
rather murky pond from which to get wash water (and water the animals). As I would
arrive, the children would run down the hill with a bucket and can, dip the bucket into the
least murky spot in the pond and I would use one small can to wet my hair and two to
rinse it as the true meaning of conservation was made clear. The children learned about
American shampoo and conditioners and a few other things as they taught me some
Spanish and cooperation.
One evening at dusk, after we had been out onto the main road to do other pits, we
arrived within a mile or so of camp on the one-lane road to find ourselves behind a line
of stopped cars and trucks and a gathering of people ahead. After considerable
confusion, we discovered that a disgruntled landowner in the area had decided to lock her
gate at the entrance of her part of the road and block the gate with a couple of vehicles.
A small group of those stopped had pulled out their guitars and were singing up a storm
while we Norte Americanos were running around fussing and muttering things like
"Let's bash it down," but word got back to camp and our head Hefes talked to the owner,
got the key and let us in. Another great war story to tell the troops.
Our food supply was plentiful since two of our planned group were unable to come and
because so often members would be in the cave, come out exhausted, grab a sandwich,
and fall into their tents despite loud parties around the fire. The Mexican members of
the expedition kept the fire going along with a huge bowl full of refried beans, tortillas
cooked on the hot rocks and mescal liquor brought in a four gallon jug. Their group had
several good guitarists, and on occasion would burst into Beatles songs so that we could
join in.
During one of the times that the rope was free, I joined the group of in-cave pit
boppers, enjoying a superb rappel and climb-out except for the very noticeable effect of
the altitude. Each time I climbed, I would end up gasping for air, seemingly never to get
