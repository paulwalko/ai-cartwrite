Washington got a special caver extraction kit in honor of the many times he had gotten
stuck in the past year or so. The kit included a girdle, a plunger, and a jar of vaseline.
Craig Roberts was recognized for his breathtakingly foul cave clothes with a box of "No
Bullshit" laundry detergent. Paul Hess and Ed Fortney received slide flutes as the club's
Pied Pipers, for taking an endless number of trainee trips, bringing together one of the
best trainee classes we have seen in years.
Several trainees received awards this year. Brian Cruikshank was named Trainee
of the Year. Mark Eisenbies was selected from a large field as Most Obnoxious. Mike
Sziede walked away with the Flame-Out award, a true achievement for a novice, though
we suspect he had prior training. Runner-up for Flame-Out went to Kevin Matera for a
truly inspired performance at one of Ed Fortney's parties; he received a custom puke
bucket with head harness. Lesley Colby was named the club sweetheart, and got a big
kiss (8 oz. of chocolate.) Lastly, Paul Donahue was recognized for the speed with
which he can cut himself free from a belay with a special plastic belay knife.
This year, special recognition went to Jerry Redder for donating the services of his
van and house to the club. Our "Favorite Landowner" award went to Buddy Penley, who
received a gift membership to the NSS, a bunch of lottery tickets, a certificate of
appreciation, and a standing ovation from all the cavers assembled. The last official
award, the A. I. Cartwright Honorarium, went to Cecile James for long-standing support
of the club through the use of her house for parties, organization of trips to Mexico and
Alabama, and the many trainee trips she has taken through the years (many as a trainee
herself.) Cecile then took advantage of her position near the microphone to present a
special, unnanounced award. To Jim Gamble she gave a red, heart-shaped, fur-lined G-
string so that he could tell the babes that "his heart is in the right place." Obviously,
Cecile is jealous of Jim's 99 44/100 % purity rating, because she does not normally play
cruel, spiteful jokes on people who don't deserve them. (Guess who wrote this
semester's Grapevine --Eds. note)
The party after Banquet was an exceptional bash. A small sub-group of partiers
exploded a carbide bomb to begin the festivities, ignorant of the cops parked just around
the corner. The usual carousing was well evidenced: dancing, piano-playing, joking,
lusting, etc., and there was plenty of food and beer to keep the speleopoliticians' mouths
occupied with worthwhile activity. Paul somehow managed to piss-off Gabbie again.
Cecile's latest flame, Gerald Moni, came all the way from Tennessee to visit. Beth and
Craig came to banquet from their respective far-away places, and officially ended their
relationship once again. The party remained alive through the night as the grizzled and
haggard poker players pelted the pathetic persons trying to sleep with reams of crumpled
newspaper. Bacon-eyed and shaking, the poker players ended their contest at 8 AM on
Sunday. Ben so impressed the club sweetheart with his pancake-cooking ability that she
kept coming back for more (pancakes, not Ben.) Jim Gamble noted that most women
aren't getting enough iron. Mike Fiore noted that, while he is still not dating Sallie, a
viewing of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" proves that marriage is not out of the
question.
VPI cavers celebrated spring in several traditional ways. Philip tried to best his
toilet-killing stunt by firing a bottle rocket at Ed Fortney's bathtub through the plumbing
access panel. Speaking of Balister, he recently moved from Newport to Pembroke.
Every move seems to take him closer to West Virginia. Hmmm, is that where he really
belongs? Several very cold and wet cavers from one Clover Hollow Cave trip think that
maybe even that far would not be far enough. Mike Fiore, it must be noted, is
celebrating this spring in a very untraditional way (untraditional for cavers, anyway) --
by graduating.
