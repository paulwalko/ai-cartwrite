You're Going to Do What?
It's 4 am, so what the bloody hell am I doing awake? I just got back from a largish
trainee trip to Newberries. My body is beginning to thaw, and I have regained enough
motor control to sit in my room without falling out of my chair.
Inside, Newberries was a great cave. Outside was an accurate simulation of hell
freezing over. Frank, the official tall person on the trip, said, "This is the kind of
weather that you couldn't get paid enough to go out in." Wendy Wickham was more to the
point: "Fuck this shit." But -- despite the icicles in our hair, the freezing rain, the hail,
mud, exhaustion, threat of hypothermia, and all that other nice stuff common to winter
caving -- we pushed on, determined to have a good time even if it kills us.
I began to wonder why we subject ourselves to this kind of abuse. Have you ever tried
to explain to a non-caver what is so appealing about getting completely covered with mud?
(The similarity to mud wrestling doesn't count.) If you have, you probably didn't more
coherent than Ben Keller did in his moment of glory on T.V. My best attempt sounded
something like:
"Well, there's mud, well... a LOT of mud. And climbing rocks and rappeling,
and lots of really, really big holes that you could fall down. And water,
cold water, in the wet caves, and sometimes even in the dry ones, depending
on who you ask. And bats and formations and lots of stuff. It's a lot of
fun; you wanna try it?"
I don't usually get any takers on that one. But if I could figure out why this sort of
self abuse is so enjoyable, and explain it, maybe there would be more women cavers. (I
don't try to recruit guys, there's enough of us already.) After enough comptemplation to
make my brain hurt (about 2 1/2 minutes), I figure -- Why should I have a reason to
cave? Sure, it's hard, but it's fun, and hey, Why not?
