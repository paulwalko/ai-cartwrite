more and more confusing, so Gerald decided to lead a group out to the area to do some
other pits to cut down on the chaos.
We headed out with 4 or 5 vehicles behind us, having to pass big trucks and very slow
cars on long steep grades, but in a short time we arrived back in San Francisco, just a
few miles from La Borbollon, and parked near the quaint paper-cut-out church. (It was
Palm Sunday and we observed continuous pageantry in the village as the natives attended
mass and made pilgrimages out of town carrying intricately woven fronds.) We
discovered that there is a water pumping station being set up at El Sotano San Francisco
#I. Innumerable members of our group dropped the pit almost to the lumpy water at the
bottom -- about 300', changed over, and climbed out, as we introduced others to the
Tiende behind the church for sodas and pastries and looked for San Francisco II. We
also reconnoitered El Truene -- a magnificent 300"+ pit at a quarry nearby that had been
made unsafe by recreational dynamite drops. Quizzing two young boys (with the usual
problem one has in asking for other sotanos when you are near a major pit, and the
language problem). Trying to get across the idea that you like variety is hell. One goes
through, "Yo quiero entender los sotanos." "Si -- aquella." "No, aqui." "No, aquella --
profundo sotano!" "Si, yo sabio; yo quiero entender un otros sotano aqui." In my basic
Spanish this probably begins to sound like 'Who's on first?' But we did get led to San
Francisco II -- I guess it was worth the effort.
It was getting later so we gathered up half of the crew and drove off to La Borbollon -
- we found the obscure entrance to the road and headed back down into the valley, past
the quarry and on to the campsite where out crew had set up out camp! Gerald headed
back to San Francisco to see if the rest of the pit-boppers were ready while I bartered
and bargained with gear I had made to satisfy basic needs of a few cavers (trying to get
across that I was charging only for the materials). Selling is a poor word for the
exchange -- the deal was not to lose too much, since money exchange rates, etc., get
confusing and one has to rebuy personal gear when one gets back to the states. Away
went all the chicken loops (chicken loopes -- as the Spanish defamation went -- they
thought it was funny too and included it in some of their silly songs around the fire), my
new Petzel jammer, my new steel D, my pretty slings, my "Paul Smith" seat, my extra
quicklinks, and my new never-used rack with the SMC steel bars -- but the deal was "I
get to use it till Saturday, OK?" "OK, what else do you have?"
Meanwhile, Maureen and Carlos were seeing to it that two crews were sent into the
cave to begin the rigging. First rigged was the chute -- an exciting back-up into a small
passage where one attaches to the rope with a biner, then moves backwards and down
and around out through the chute over a flowstone traverse -- all the while trying not to
fall back too far as one reaches across with the right foot into a small rimstone pool for
security. The second thing rigged was the 715' pit using an 850' rope, setting up a tail
for tandem climbs. As soon as this was done, one crew went on down as a push crew and
another was sent in to survey. This process was continued throughout the expedition as
some of us surveyed above the pit and others (who weren't going down to the bottom) did
the big pit during the time that none of the teams from the bottom needed the rope. I
never pushed to do the bottom since there were quite a few very strong cavers for the
push trips (up until Wednesday when the evening Mescal parties began to take their toll
and the ranks of gung-ho cavers began to thin down) and my survey skills were not
adequate to the vertical nature of the cave. (I have served notice since I've gotten back
that I will no longer act as ever-ready lead tape, but will learn to do instrument and
sketching.)
As time went on, more and more crews came and went, more and more rope was
called for -- bad riggings were replaced, every bolt that could be scraped up was used,
