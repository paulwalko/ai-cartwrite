Thoughts on Caving
Caving: It's not just a sport -- IT'S A WAY OF LIFE!! Such is the philosophy of
various people who choose to roam around underground in their free time (me included).
Above-grounders might call us idiots, but we know that we are smarter than they are.
Heck, it takes an enormous amount of intellegence to decide to shove one's body into
tight, deep, muddy holes, where god intended only vermin, bats, insects, and diseases to
live. We cavers can get just a little bit closer to hell than anyone else. Non-cavers don't
even know what they are missing.
People who are truly enjoying their lives (such as cavers, of course) have a strange
and persistent desire to go where they're not supposed to. Just take a look at the sort of
things these people do with their spare time:
Skydiving -- hurling one's body towards the ground at incredible speeds. Enthusiasts
often resemble large birds who have suddenly died in mid-flight.
Mountain Climbing -- destroying most of one's appendages from frostbite and entering
the latter stages of hypothermia. This is done in an attempt to reach the summit, where
nothing lives, and the air has the same oxygen concentration as the atmosphere of the
moon.
Rock Climbing -- needlessly risking life and limb, and straining every muscle in
one's body to get to a perch that can be reached by walking up the side of the mountain or
by taking a helicopter.
The list of activities like this is quite long, and of course, caying is near the top of it.
"The greatest fun seems like the greatest stupidity to those who can't appreciate it,"
someone once said. But, of course, people who can't appreciate caving are pathetic.
Caving is a smart thing to do. Everyone must do something that makes no sense, for no
apparent logical reason at all, or we would all go crazy. So now I think it is time to have
a beer.
