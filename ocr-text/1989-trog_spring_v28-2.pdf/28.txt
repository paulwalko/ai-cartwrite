obviously out of the question. When considering such a trip, remember that other cavers
may one day want to return. If you go, DON'T GET CAUGHT.
2: Treat your landowner right. Don't make a liar out of yourself by never getting
around to sending him that map or those photos. While he my not expect these things, try
not to make promises you con't keep. A nice touch is to supply him with a copy of the
map symbols used, and in some cases a copy of the topo map showing his land and the
cave locations. This is probably the most often abused rule of landowner relations.
3: Again, communicate. Know any rules the owner wants you to follow. Where to
park, when and if it is O.K. to drive to the cave entrance(s), how to leave gates
(generally you should leave them as you find them), etc. NEVER camp or build fires
without specific permission, and don't mess with his animals or farm equipment. In
general, use common sense (even though for some of us this is rather uncommon!), if
you see things such as an injured animal, or perhaps a newborn calf, make it a point to
let the owner know. Leaving trash, even a single cigarette butt or pop-top, can leave a
bad taste in the owner's mouth.
4: Until you get to know the landowner, never act too crazy, drink, or do anything
illegal if there is any chance he might not approve; even if he's not around. Try to act as
if cavers are a responsible lot and the owner will be more likely to allow you to return.
Quite often once you get to know him he'll offer you a beer, or even turn out to be as
deranged as most cavers... but never assume this to be the case until he makes the "first
move." Unless he starts it, fireworks, naked women, and bestiality are definitely out.
Even way back in a mine.
5: As stated above, we represent cavers as a group no matter where we are. Be
considerate of the rest of the group! Pissing off landowners is not a good way to win
friends and influence people in the caving world. This also holds true in general --not
just with individual landowners. Show respect for all residents in karst areas. Like I
said, if they don't own a cave they probably know someone who does. And who knows...
one day we might find a cave on their land.
So, there it is. Any comments? Like I said, I've made mistakes too, but I think the
time has come for some of us to grow up a little. Or find another sport... some of us
would like to keep on caving in the years to come.
