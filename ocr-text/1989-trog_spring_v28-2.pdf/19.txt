Tips on Caving
Caving, as we all know, is a wonderful sport, hobby, way of life, or whatever you
want to call it. It must be done right, however, or a cave trip could turn out to be a big
pain in the ass! Actually, even when done right, a cave trip can turn out to be a big pain in
the ass, just like a long movie in an uncomfortable theater. Even though we are at the
mercy of the cave gods every time we go underground, or attempt to go underground, we
must still try to make the cave trip as enjoyable as possible. So here are some 'expert
suggestions from a trainee.
The first thing you have to do is select a cave. To do this with ease, merely consider
the cave's name, which can tell you a lot about that particular cave. For example:
Good Cave: Clover Hollow
Bad Cave: Bat Shit Sucker Hole
Here are some other important points, which can eaisly be derived from the
particular cave's name:
New River Cave: Bring some spray paint (just kidding)
Golandrinas: Not a day trip
Echol's Cave: Don't go if you're fat
Mammoth Cave: Use only the designated restrooms
Murder Hole: Bring some vertical gear
Other important points:
Ridgewalking -- a sadistic form of punishment invented by the ancient Chinese when
they needed something more agonizing than water torture. Avoid it at all costs! Some
extremely sick GCCS people might tell you that it will be fun, and that you might actually
find a cave. HA!! DON'T BELIEVE THEM, or you might end up in an experience closely
resembling the Battan Death March.
Surveying -- a very fun part of caving. To better understand this concept, it is
necessary to introduce Newton's Fourth Law of Caving: The size of a vertical drop is
inversely proportional to the amount of gear you have, AND is directly proportional to the
distance between you and the gear. 1st Corollary: The time elapsed before you discover
this drop is directly proportional to the weight of gear you carry with you.
In other words, if you don't bring any gear, you will discover a pit so deep that it
actually leads to hell. And, if you bring more gear than a mid-size army because of
rumors of virgin vertical passage, you will be engaged in a constant, tight crawl that
goes on literally forever, and is uphill both going in and coming out.
There is also Newton's Fifth Law of Caving: The distance (horizontal and vertical)
from your car to the cave is directly proportional to the severity of the weather. If the
weather is brutally hot, cold enough to freeze nitrogen, or if there is a rainstorm the
size of a class 5 hurricane, you will not be able to get your car within ten miles of the
cave entrance. Thus, you will never wear the right amount of clothes into the cave. This
is why layering is important. That way, you can tie cumbersome, unused layers of
clothing around your waist, and they will snag, grab, and tear on every single jut or nick
in the entire cave. You don't even have to come close to these spots, either. Your unused
