Doing the Unthinkable...
Even though I'm not a member of the VPI Cave Club/Cave Club of Va. Tech/VPI
Grotto/Club Mud, most of you know me due to the fact that I have been semi-
permanently attached at the hip to the previous vice president for the past three years.
[However, I would like to clarify something--Paul often ditched me to go caving and his
receipt of the PW award two years ago was completely unfounded. Being rather new on
the caving scene, I was rather grossed out by the state Paul's caye threads were in. I've
always believed that it was best just to leave men to their own devices--everything either
turns out ok in the end or rots. So I only asked Paul once if I could wash his cave
clothes. He told me NO WAY in no uncertain terms, and I couldn't understand why.
This was, of course, before I found out that I had committed a major faux pas. One day
I was discussing what had happened with a past president (no names will be given) and
she informed me that cayers were proud of how dirty the clothes they wore caving got
(and stayed, I might add). Coming as I do from a house ruled by a woman who is
absolutely fanatical about how clean everything has to be, this certainly was a novel idea.
As a matter of fact, I didn't truly believe it until I heard the story about Craig Robert's
coyeralls on the practice rescue last fall.
Well, this was all well and good, until one day following several weekends of not
seeing Paul due to long and muddy caving trips. I walked up on his porch, where he'd
left his clothes (right next to his motorcycle) and they ATTACKED me. Now, having
clothes that will stand up by themselves is one thing--even some of my Levi's have been
in that state, away from the influence of my mother--but clothes that will attempt
Greatest Bodily Harm on innocent passersby is a totally different dog. A sharp kick to
the left sleeve gave me enough time to slip into the house, whereupon I informed Paul
that his cave clothes were going to be washed, whether they wanted to be or not.
Luckily, we were planning on doing laundry that night. Who knows what would have
happened to me if those coveralls had been allowed to run rampant any longer?
And now, a few pointers for those of you who are going to take the plunge:
1. Never try to wash your cave clothes in the same load with other clothes. This may
seem like common sense for not getting that good ol' Virginia dirt rinsed into your
whites, but there is another reason. Cave clothes don't like to be around the rest of your
wardrobe, and have a tendency to eat anything that hasn't been in a cave.
2. Do not be alarmed if they struggle when you put them in the car. Your dog always
knows when it's time to go to the vet; your cave clothes will know when it's time to go
to the laundromat. Tie them up if you have to (your old tied seat comes in real handy for
this). It will be even more difficult when you try to put them in the washer.
3. Tide is for America's dirt. Lots and lots of Tide. For lots and lots of America's
dirt.
4. You may have to wash them twice. Or three times. Or maybe even more,
depending on how ornery they are. And then run them through the washer without any
detergent. Cave dirt is a very interesting substance--upon contact with water, it forms
into a thick paste not unlike brown Superglue that immediately adheres to anything it
comes into contact with. This needs to be rinsed out so that the next time you go caving
your coveralls don't feel like they're made out of plywood, and also so the person using
that washer after you doesn't sue Cook's because all of their clothes turned a uniform
shade of brown.
When you take your cave clothes out of the dryer, you may be worried that someone
switched laundry with you. The likelihood of this actually happening is very slim, and
