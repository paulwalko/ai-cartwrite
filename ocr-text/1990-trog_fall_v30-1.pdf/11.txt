The New River Cave Sign
April was coming to a close and I had plans for the weekend. Doug Bruce, Sue
Setzler and I had set out for Blacksburg rather late that Friday in order to accomplish
our mission: put an aluminum "No Trespassing" sign above the entrance to New River
Cave, and then go see the waterfall (which I had never seen). That evening had been
long and eventful. Doug had talked to Tim Kilby (the owner of New River Cave) and
obtained the 14 x 8 x 1/4" aluminum sign which Tim had carefully etched. Sue had
decided to join the party at the elevth hour (literally), after we had all enjoyed a cookout
at Barry Fizers.
We arrived in Blacksburg early the next morning, and late that same morning, set
out for the cave. The long hike up the hill was made even longer by my inability to
keep gravity from snatching some of my gear and sending it down the hill. We also
stopped every time we saw a tree that we deemed suitable for a plastic "No
Trespassing" sign.
Eventually, we arrived at the entrance, and after some discussion, Doug and Sue
proceeded to the top of the cliff to rig the rope while I dodged rockfall and redirected
the rope at the bottom. Soon Doug was hanging twelve feet off the ground pounding a
semi-flat spot in the rock. The three of us quickly discovered the error of letting the
heaviest person set the first bolt: the cliff was overhung. We had to manually hold
Doug against the wall. However, the bolt was eventually placed, the haulers were still
alive and Doug's helmet had successfull protected his skull.
The next bolters had the easier task of setting a hanger and clipping in to it with a
cowtail. Eventually all four bolts were set. Since the holes were not pre-drilled we
sketched where they shold be drilled, packed up and left.
That night Doug drilled holes into the sign and we drank beer while discussing
ways to vandalize the sign. The next morning we set out for the cave with a metal file,
concrete mix, Vaseline, epoxy, an empty yogurt container and Koichiro Takamizawa.
We rigged the rope and determined that the metal file would be put to good use.
One eon later the sign fit the bolts and the process of mixing Quick-rete began.
Ko drew on his past knowledge of playing in the sand and determined that the mix
worked better after shifting. Doug applied the concrete to the wall, bolted the sign on,
and then applied more concrete to the edge. We hoped this would prevent vandals
from standing on the ledge to the left of the entrance and removing the sign with a long
crowbar. Next we placed epoxy around and over the bolts to make removal difficult.
Our final touch was a liberal coating of Vaseline, which we hoped would deter spray
paint.
It was getting late so we packed up and discussed how long the sign might last.
To everyone's surprise, it is still there today. And to my amazement, even though I
never saw the waterfall in my two attempts that weekend, I did succeed the next month.
