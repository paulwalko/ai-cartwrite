Resurvey of Simmons-Mingo
(Reprinted from the Spring 1983 Trog)
"Hey Frank, want to go on a survey trip to Simmons-Mingo?" "For sure," was my
reply. That was stupid!!

My internal clock told me to wake up, or was it Bob Carts' ever-present snoring that
disturbed my sleep. Manually, I opened my eye lids with my ragged fingers. I
proceeded to drag myself out of the musty, old sleeping bags left over from the
"fiasco-expedition" some years ago.
I flicked my trusty Tekna-Lite and saw five 'trashed' cavers cuddled up in their
cocoons, oblivious to my awakening or Mike Artz's dense aroma. Here we were, at
"Base-camp," a small but pleasant haven over-populated with rank smelling sleeping
bags, garbage, food and spent carbide dumps, telephone wires, relay boxes, stoves,
fossilized shit, and god knows what else that was abandoned throughout
Simmons-Mingo from the "fiasco." I dreaded the thought of dragging some of this shit
further out of the cave, as all the survey teams are presently doing, to help
Simmons-Mingo to be, once again, a respectable cave.
My body cried for the sleeping bag, to slip back into heaven for another hour. But
NO!! We must cruise out of the bloody cave. I do not know if it was "exit fever" or the
oncoming withdrawals from the lack of cold Wiedermanns. Damn, we were 6 hours
from the entrance!

That was my second survey adventure into Simmons-Mingo cave in Mingo, WV. It
was Eric Anderson's third. Mike Artz of JMU grotto and the PSC'ers from NOVA are
currently resurveying the cave.
Our survey crew, know as Wilburs, Bat Squad Plunkers, and Pluke the Monkey,
usually consisted of Mike Artz (sketch, the Boss, and 'Fartz'), Bob Carts (Brunton, Boss
#2, and snores), Eric Anderson (lead tape and Wieds) and me (notes, sewer tape,
photographer and asshole) plus one or two other cavers thrown in for interests sake.
The average trip lasts for 23 hours and we surveyed (resurveyed, excuse me)
1300'+ of passage, 40-50 stations. We surveyed between RP2 and Basecamp, which
is at least 5 hours of non-stop caving into Simmons-Mingo!
My first trip into S+M was during Turkey Break; also I wanted to see if Mike and
Bob were ready for a long tour/photo trip into Ellison's for XMAS vacation. On that
particular trip we found 400'+ of virgin passage with stunning gypsum formations,
including some flowers blossoming 12 inches wide!!
Simmons-Mingo is typical of West Virginian caves; friendly, zooming trunk
passage, and decorated with splendid formations. One spectacular trunk passage has
rare mirabilite growing like weeds.
S&M does lack one characteristic; she has no vertical pits to YO-YO. But she does
make up for her lack of potholes with diverse caving to Basecamp and beyond. She
requires stamina from the caver with 5 or 6 free-climbs, running passages, vertical
crawls, boulder hopping, swimming, sleeze-bag crawls, and adequate pit stops.
After 4 hours of caving through dry galleries, we hit upon a roaring stream (shin to
'nad' deep, depending on the season) that we had to wade through for 1/2 hour. Very
