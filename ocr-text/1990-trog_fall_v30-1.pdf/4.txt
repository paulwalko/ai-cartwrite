Editors' Column
Hello from the Editor! Thanks for all of the stuff! It certainly
surprised us cynical editors that we would have more than enough for a
decent Trog. Despite occasional griping (where's the sign-out news, etc.)
it's really a lot of fun putting together a Trog. If any of you want to help
out on future Trogs, or possibly become an editor, let us know. You may
have some great ideas for the Trog.
Gesundheit,
Kay
Well, another Trog hits the press. Many thanks to all those who
contributed, it's a good mix of stuff. Not bad for something I didn't think
would have anything at all! The officers got the stuff in on time but it
was the remainder that kept me guessing how big it would turn out.
Thanks to Heather who helped with the typing and layout.
Relax, don't worry
read the trog!
