Sandy and Philip for this winter. A big group is going to Mexico for the annual trip. Paul Hess
has a parttime job at the new REI store in NOVA near Bailey's Crossroads. The store has a
climbing wall. Tom Bank is still in PA. He sent a keg donation, and wrote that he should have his
truck together by banquet. Viola Ritchie moved to Louisiana, of all places. Mike Futrell is
engaged again, but not to Viola. This makes at least the 4th time. Steve and Ann Marie have
bought a house in the Vicker area of Christiansburg and hope to close around Christmas. A bunch
of cavers roofed the Redders' house which they promptly moved out of. They've moved over the
river and thru the woods. (Joan & Jerry Redder have started moving into their new home in the
Indian Hills subdivision somewhere off Mt. Tabor Road near Blacksburg.) Cecile's dog has bitten
4 people and a dog. She may not be keeping it. Ben Keller got his Masters and is now in Iowa
working on his PhD. Jim Gamble turned in his thesis, and will be defending his Masters soon.
Natalie Serbu is researching alcoholism with a professor here at Tech. In addition, she has joined
the "Just say no" committee with the Golden Key Honor Society. (Yes. This is serious.) Perhaps
Trainee Todd H., is scamming a certain Shona S. Al Ostrowski (Al Who) was seen in Ton 80 on
leave from the army. Lor Windle was due to get out of the Marines in Dec., but that may be
changed with the Saudi Arabia troop build up. Old farts Mike Conefry and family, plus Don
Davison and Cheryl Jones are safe in the Middle East (respectively Qatar & Oman), but there's no
word on whether Lawrence Britt is over there or no. Robyn & Bill Koerschner won't be moving
to Calgary, but staying in Borger, TX for a while. Hilary Minnich is alive and well in Santa Fe
NM doing a lot of that L-cave caving. Gary Moss is now the new improved slimmed down
version of Gary Moss. Lynn Wright and Ed Richardson are hosting this year's New Year's Eve
Party.
