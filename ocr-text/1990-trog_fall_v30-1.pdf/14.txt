"THAT'S YOURS, PRIVATE."
No way! I looked back up at the sergeant and he looked back at me. There was just no way
that I could tell the man that I didn't even like beer. I reached in, pulled on out, opened it,
and drank it down. It tasted GOOD! And so did the next one and the one after that. I've
been a beer drinker ever since.
So, whereas I was not exactly ordered to start drinking beer, I felt as though I was in a
position where I couldn't refuse.
