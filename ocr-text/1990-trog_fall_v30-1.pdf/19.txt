Oh, that feels so much better...
or how to modify your tied seat
to make it almost, if not more comfortable
than those fancy expensive premade seats
Oh, so you just spent all your money on trivial items (like books, food
and rent) and now you don't have any left to buy cave gear. So you made a
bad decision. Next time forgo the food and buy caving gear. But what do
you do in the meantime? Rob the bookstore? No! Sell back your books,
sublet the apartment and starve? No!! Well what can you do?
Try this neat, nifty, cool addition to the seat that you tie with your
one inch webbing. It goes like this:
1. After you tie your final knot, withit's back offs, in the standard cave
club seat, make sure you have about 4' of webbing left on each tail.
2. Take the tails of the backed off knot and do another wrap around your
waist and tie it off with a square knot in the center of your back.
3. Now take the tails of the squareknot and tuck them behind the leg loops
on your legs.
4. Finally tie the two tails together in a square or other appropriate knot.
You can tuck the extra webbing in a pocket or something. The final
result should resemble a triangle with one point at the top of your butt and
the other two points at each leg loop.
Here are the advantages of this seat:
-It dosen't alter the basic cave club seat.
-It keeps those damn leg loops from falling down your legs whenever you
walk.
-It distributes the loading of the waist and leg loops more evenly, thus
making a more comfortable seat.
The disadvantages to the seat modifications are:
-It takes more webbing and more time to tie. People with just enough
webbing for their seats won't be able to do this.
-The additional webbing may get snagged when you slide on your butt.
I personally almost prefer to use this type of seat when I don't want
to haul so much gear or when I don't want to mess with the lousy buckle on
my expensive premade seat. This is a very basic modification, but it
works. However if you can improve it, let me know so I can try it too.
