This article is is not about caving, it's about BEER.
Beer and cavers. Cavers and beer. It's difficult to think of one without the other. But it
wasn't always that way with this caver. When I first started caving, I drank WINE. After
all, I was in Architecture. Beer was for everybody else.
About three years into my caving career, I suddenly found myself out of Tech and into Basic
Training. Basic Training had nothing to do with computer languages. In a way, it was kind
of fun. We got to march. We got to throw grenades. We got to shoot guns. We got to stab
dummies with bayonets. We got to do PT.
At the end of basic training, there was a final exam, although not the sort of final exam they
have at Tech. It was one in which we got to march, we got to throw grenades, and we got to
stab dummies with bayonets. About three weeks before the final exam, the company
commander tried to get everyone into it, and make his company look good, by promising the
highest scoring trainee a case of beer. Well, he wasn't going to suck me in thatway. No sir!
Hell, I didn't even like beer. I drank WINE. Beer was for everybody else.
We took the final exam in which we got to march, we got to throw grenades, and we got to
stab dummies with bayonets. Three days later, the entire company was lined up in the
company area eagerly anticipating a weekend pass. A corporal came out of the CQ's office
and yelled, "PRIVATE SIMONDS!"
Who me? My key to survival in basic training had been to remain anonymous. This couldn't
be! "HERE, CORPORAL."
"REPORT TO THE CQ'S OFFICE."
What could I have possibly done? Out of 140 basic trainees, why me? "YES, CORPORAL."
I trembled my way into the CQ's office and there behind the desk sat the meanest, nastiest,
drill sergeant in the whole basic training company. A man I will remember until the day I
die. "PRIVATE SIMONDS?"
Gulp. "YES, SERGEANT."
He pointed to a shiny galvanized trash can next to the desk."LOOK IN THAT GARBAGE
CAN, PRIVATE."
I pulled off the lid and saw that the whole thing was full of crushed ice and beer.
