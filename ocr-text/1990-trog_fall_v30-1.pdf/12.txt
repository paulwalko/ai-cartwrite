The Figure Eight with a Bight
This knot is a figure eight with a bight. It can be used everywhere a bowline on a bight can,
however, if you're like me and prefer figure eights over bowlines, this is a knot for you. Lately
I've begun to use more technical rigs than the standard friction wrap rig like the self equilizing rig
off of two bolts. I've noticed that unless bowlines are dressed carefully, they have a tendency to
slip in stiff rope like PMI. There is no telling how even a well dressed bowline on a bight would
perform under shock load conditions (like if the bolts pulled out), and the potential to slip remains.
Personally I want to do as little movement as possible if the bolts are going to fail. I also like the
figure eight with a bight because it is much more stable than the bowline on a bight even when
weighted laterally like a butterfly. These are two good reasons why I think you may want to
switch.
