Grotto Grapevine
Since it's been ages between Trogs, there has been much info for the grapevine, and even more
that's been forgotten. Starting way back in early last summer, Ed Fortney was Float Trip Admiral.
Float trip only took 4 hours because of the fast water. The party after was at the Ellett Hotel. After
many many summer parties, i.e. beach week, Peterson's party, etc. etc. VPI hosted OTR under
the guidance of Jerry Redder, with Dave Cinsavich as cochair. Paul Kirchman will be chairperson
next year. Jerry made everyone work their butts off until they were tired, but everyone still had
fun. Les did not win everything this year. Ko, Brian, and Sue Setzler were among the winners in
the vertical contests. Over 2000 people attended. The biggest news of OTR was how well Philip
Balister took care of Sandy Knapp when she was drunk. Yes, Philip actually has a girlfriend!
Dave Cinsavich has been seeing Kim Hansen, who wrote a nice article about the VPI cave club in
the Preston Journal, Blacksburg's alternative to the Collegiate Times. We're afraid to ask Dave
about his most recent DUI. Joe "Puke" Uknalis has been seen hoarding a certain young blond
female (Heather) in his love nest at sign-out. Heather is developing a reputation for dating New
Jersey guys. Ko Takamizawa and Joan Johnson are engaged. Buddy Bundy is engaged. John
Lohner got married last summer in Colorado. Steve and Ann Marie Conner attended the wedding,
and then went backpacking with Keith Smith and Mary Fauci. Glen Davis married Alice Lane on
Sept. 22. It was a small family wedding, but they're planning a big party for December. Nancy
Parks married Dennis. Mike Gaydosh and his wife recently had a baby. Sue and Rick LaCourse
had a baby boy, John, this past Spring. Linda and Randy Stoutenburgh are expecting a baby
sometime around Feb. 4. Will they make it to banquet?
VPI people attended WVACS and TAG. The only report this grapevine writer heard was the
following:
A funny thing happened while at WVACS the fall of '90... After a long, fun day of rapunzelling at
the quarry entrance to "Bone", and later caving in "Buckeye Creek" cave, a small group of
individuals were sitting around a campfire relaxing, & telling stories about barking cave spiders.
During the ensuing conversation, a well-known, blond-haired Pres. of the Cave Club fell asleep,
muttering the name of her fantasy lover "SVEN" over and over. All attempts to investigate and
identify the mysterious Don Juan have been unsuccessful due to heated resistance from the
aforementioned Pres. Can YOU tell us who he is? Any further info would be greatly appreciated.
Any and all questions should be directed to the Pres. of the Cave Club.
A rescue was called out last August for a man who went caving alone near Bluefield and didn't tell
anyone. Two different caves were searched, and he was finally found in another cave by local
cavers. The VPI cavers basically stood around looking important for the cameras. Ko and Jim
Gamble did help extricate the guy.
The practice rescue was held at New River Cave under the coordination of Ed Fortney. Tim Kilby
not only let us borrow his cave, but even came along. Thanks Tim! Ko was the victim. There
was good attendance from both trainees and members.
One of the NSS board members ruined landowner relations in Skydusky Hollow. North Carolina
cavers are no longer welcome at Buddy Penley's place.
The halloween party was held at the sign-out again. The Zo.'s sponsored the Friday night party.
Much groping was seen at the Zo's soir√©e between Jake, Berta, Maurya, Les, Paul and hopeful
new trainee, John. The most notable costume was the walking dining table (fully set including
candles) that contained Kathi Wagner. Cecile came as the Wonderwere Woof. Jim Gamble came
as the trendy Bart Simpson, and Jim Washington was a mass of cave formations. Capt. Ed came
as himself. Dave and Kim won prizes as a pair of dice. Jamie Lutch now has the cleanest feet
around after having his toes sucked by the now infamous, Bryce "Rainbow" Bolton. Some
trainees reportedly puked.
