Discovery is what caving is all about right? You like to go to new
caves and find new passages. You like to return to familiar caves and
learn how you've changed. However, this fall our club has been making
some very unpleasant discoveries about changes taking place in Skydusky
Hollow (i.e. Newberry-Baines).
This semester many disconcerting incedences have been brought to
our attention. Newberry-Baines has been vandalized with enough trash to
fill two 30 gallon garbage bags, grafitti scratched in the rock, an absurd
amount of wax, and even an open latrine. Buddy has found it necessary to
begin charging a camping fee that some have "forgotten" to pay. The
Baines have been so upset by obnoxious cavers that relations have become
severly stressed.
This is not cool, and we take it personally. Cavers are ruining
relations we have been working on for 40 years. How is it that cavers can
forget what a privilage it is to use these people's land? This disrespect is
a serious and unfortunate trend in the caving community. Irreparable
damage may occur if it has not already (Buddy has now closed his land to
everyone from North Carolina). Something must be done soon. Just look at
the caves in TAG that have been victimized and closed by inconsiderate and
irresponsible cavers if you don't believe us. Most who care know that good
landowner relations are hard enough to build. Ones like these take decades
to develop through service to the owners by local grottos. It takes very
little to erase everything they work for. Cavers who come from out-of-
state or far away must work twice as hard.
