President's Column
It's 76Â° out, the stores have their "snow-covereda Christmas decorations up, and the professors are
cramming all those last bits of tantilizing information in before exams. All this could only mean that the fall
semester here in Blacksburg is about to end and that it is time for another exciting issue of the Trog and
my final installment of the President's column. So here goes...
Business-wise, the club was awarded the Corey grant from the NSS with which we purchased a
surveymaster to be used for GCCSing. Also, the process of incorporation is trudging along, which means
that a newly revised constitution will be presented soon.
The club is steadily growing in membership having voted in 1 person this fall. If you've made it to a recent
meeting, you would probably have noted that we had an unusually large number of trainees join us this
fall. Many of these trainees are very close to membership thanks to the numerous trainee trips in
Blacksburg, Wa, TAG & WVACS. On Nov. 3, Ed Fortney ran a practice rescue at New River while Hoss
Leiffer put together a group to pull the trees out of New Castle Murder Hole as a result of Hugo. Thanks
much to both for your efforts.
As far as parties go, we've been doing rather well for ourselves. Halloween was a huge success, however,
some may debate that since reportedly no one got sick. Banquet will be held on Feb. 16 in Owens
banquet room on campus. This should be a special banquet as it is our 25th anniversary. Invitations will
be going out in January.
Well... enough of these disjointed ramblings. (Just what AM I supposed to write in here anyhow?) Cave
hard!

Well, I'm still here. Fooled ya all did'nt I? Things have been gong rather well, in terms of vice
presidential stuff. The club seems to be growing in popularity as seen by the fourty odd (meant figuratively
and literally) prosepective members that we have. Honestly I am rather amazed. Sure we get lots of new
people at the beginning of the year, but after they see how masochistic we are, the group usually drops off
to a mere handful of hardy cavers. Not this year! They all stuck around. This year the trainees are
enthusiastic, able bodied, and for the most part pretty good partiers too.
Bridge sessions have gone well, thanks for the help I have been getting. Most if not all, the prospective
members have done the basics and are now trying obstical courses, passing knots, heel hangs, and what
ever else. Even on one of the most miserable Fridays that I've ever been to we still had several people out
and even one or two new people!.
Congrats to Rich Geisler, the latest person to be voted in (#323).
Thanks to all who have been helping out this year. You know who you are and I thank you sincerely.
I would also like to say this to all members. "THIS" Well, actually this: the club has lots of new people this
year and we are at a point in time where your help is needed. I am not saying that we should all take mongo
casts of thousands traniee trips, but rather this: If you are taking a trip, leave a spot or two open for new
people. I know it can be a pain sometimes, extra responsibility perhaps. But in the long run this will help
prospective members get varied caving experience and it will help YOU see the good bunch of trainees we
have this year.
Anything else? Plastic rescue was very succesful. Thanks to everyone's help Ko was evacuated
before Star Trek came on, which made many people very happy. Well, I must be off now but don't worry I'll
be back again.
TAFN
and cave hard
