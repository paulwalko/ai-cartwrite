Dear Mr. (Caver);
On a routine sport trip into Newberry-Banes Cave on October 6, 1990,
VPI cavers discovered recent and relatively extensive abuse of the cave.
Found on the trip were: garbage enough to fill two 30 gallon trash bags on
the following cleanup trip, fresh graffiti scratched into the walls
including a name and date "MIKE TAYLOR 90", an open latrine right on a
major route through the cave which had been left uncovered, and finally an
absurd amound of melted wax from candles left to burn down.
Understand that this letter isnot an accusation. We simply wish to
remind all the people who signed the register during the last few months
tht this type of abuse is not only frowned upon in the caving community
but is against Virginia State Law (Chapter 12.7 Section 10-150.14
Virginia Cave Protection Act). We realize that this letter will go out to
many concientious cavers and apologize for this. However the
consternation felt by us all at this breech of faith in some 40 year history
of good landowner relations and minimum impact caving, requires some
form of action.
Sincerely,
Lesley Colby
President
VPI Cave Club
