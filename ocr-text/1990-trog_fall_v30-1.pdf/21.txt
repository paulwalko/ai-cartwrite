Name that Caver
Our first caver has been in the club for one year and joined the club to "meet babes" (boy I'd
he hard up). Well, now that we know the gender of this caver, we'll continue. Caver's favorite
cave is Stomp Bottom, "spells just like it smells." And speaking of smells, the longest time this
caver has spent underground was 105 hours. (eeek! Run for the Glade.)
The scariest or most horrible thing that ever happened in a cave was getting his pee bottle and
water bottle mixed up. (The outcome was untold.... we can only imagine.)
Caver thinks the worst thing about caving is "not enough babes" (of course, what babe
would when you smell like Stomp Bottom). The other bad thing is missing bowling for dollars on
Saturday morning (ah--a true intellectual).
And what is the best thing about caving...why it's spotting female trainees on climbs.
(Every female should run for the chastity belts.)
Best advice to trainees..."Caving is like sex--when it's good, it's great and when it's
bad...it's still pretty good."
This caver wouldn't reveal much information...must have some dark secret to hide.... Can
you guess who it is???
Our next caver has been in the club for ten years and joined the club to "groove with the
experience" (far out, man). Caver 2's favorite cave is. Links. (Do we know this "person"?) The
longest time Caver 2 has spent underground was 26 hours.
The worst thing happened while surveyeing a very narrow passage with a stream running
through "his" coveralls. (Needed a bath anyway.) While squeezing through the passage, turning
over to make through, suddenlt there is no way out. So, after turning around in a very tight spot
and heading back, those darn ole coveralls get caught and the light goes out. (Did Caver2 make it
back...guess so...but what about those coveralls, how did they survive?)
Another scary thing happened while in Murder Hole.... Here we have the case of the new
rope, doubles, and ZOOMING down. Only thirty feet from the bottom, Caver 2 realizes the end is
near and can't stop. "Bottom belays work." (Is that why they call it Murder Holr??)
Caver 2 thinks the worst thing about caving is when you are changing clothes after a wet
cave and your feet freeze to the road, "I hate that!" and "it drys out my hair" (Ha Ha HaHaHa).
The best thing about caving is big virgin passage (or just a big virgin), (That's pleasant" asnd
"either the people or the food" (you figure it out).
Best advice to trainees: "Be persistant trying to become a member because starting out, many
are ignored" (unless you are female).
Can you name the damn caver?
