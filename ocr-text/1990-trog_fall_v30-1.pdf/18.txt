the lighter, smaller of the above types of goodies. In cases like this, it is an extremely good idea to
pre-eat from the better foods, on the principle of carbo loading. I would not advise anyone to go
through the whole loading routine, which involves depleting carbos for a day or two in advance of
loading up. This can be dangerous. But a heavy meal in even simple starches the night before can
make quite a difference in your endurance, and so can a good sized breakfast on the day of your
trip.
Beside the necessity for sufficient calories, these must be easily made available to the muscles.
Since this is a task for the circulatory system, it follows that there must be a sufficient blood
volume. We usually think of this as a constant, but in fact blood volume fluctuates quite a bit over
periods of exercise, primarily due to sweating or urination. Loss of up to several cups of water per
hour would be in the normal range. A loss of another cup or two per hour in breathing would be
reasonable. In a trip as above, one could easily lose a whole day's ration of water without even
stopping to relieve the bladder. Some of this is made up from body tissue water, but any loss of
fluid is first from the blood. Losing more than a few percent makes the blood notably thicker,
which adds to the load on the heart and reduces nutrient transportation ability. This is a cause for
exercise-related cramping of muscle groups and is a factor in next-day soreness, as lactic acid may
build up in muscles not sufficiently hydrated. Meals heavy in fats also thicken the blood noticably,
resulting in after meal drowsiness.
A human doing ordinary activities needs one-half ounce of water per pound body weight per
day. I weigh in at about 170-175 lbs., so I must consume about 85 ounces of water, better than
two and one-half quarts, when I an just lounging and loafing. Even for a little lady weighing only
120 lbs., nearly two quarts is needed every day. If in a stress situation, it is necessary to increase
this by 50-100%. It isn't actually necessary to measure input; instead, if outputted urine is as dark
as a pale broomstraw, more water is needed. Although some of this may be replaced by fruit
juices, which also have a quick boost for the blood sugar levels, it is not fair to count colas, coffee,
tea, or alcoholic drinks. All of these are really a burden on the body, and a person who drinks a lot
of them shouldd also drink similar quantities of pure water in adddition to the normal amount
needed. One qualification here: caffeine improves both mental alertness and physical performance;
therefore, it can be a help in remaining sharp or recovering from fatigue, on a need basis only. It
will not, however, sustain you for long periods, no matter how much sugar you put in it.
Another thing worth noting is that Vitamin Cis well known to promote resistance to stress. In
a person who is conscious of good eating habits, supplementary vitamins are not likely to be
necessary, maybe not even helpful. But I try to take 100mg of C, and also Vit A, Vit E, and a Vit
B complex every few days, and especially before I go on a long cave trip. Overdoing vitamins is
no help, but it isn't likely you will do too much of them unless you are a fanatic taking megadoses.
Although it is not directly related to nutrition...staying up late and boozing previous to heavy
exertion is one of the worst things for a person to do. Not only does alcohol deplete vitamins and
itself require a lot of water for metabolizing, the lack of rest and recuperation incurred by this will
show up in the first few hours underground.
If I had to pick only one thing I could impose on all cavers, it would be this: Drink Water
When In The Dirt. Your body, even at worst, can withstand a lot of abuse. The one thing it can't
do without is working fluid for energy and waste tranport. And the working fluid for the body is
water.

Dear Levis:
I lost my ass in a cave.
Please send me a new one.
