enjoyable; it cools you down. The music by the stream breaks the monotony of a dry
cave system. Thear that the cave gets super sleazy (sounds fun) past Basecamp, near
the Oil Drum Falls and towards the second entrance (a possible through trip). We are
hoping to survey that part of the cave in the future. For now, I'm just getting into
surveying, and I love it. I hope to get more involved in surveying and to lead trips into
S&M with other VPI cavers.

After putting away my camera, we started once again the relentless pace towards
the entrance. Instead of guide numbers and f-stops, I concentrated on putting my right
foot forward, then bringing my left foot forward, and holding in the shit until we were out
(too bad it never works that way). We all can hear the cold beers whimpering to be
had at the entrance. At one point in the cave, we were 550 feet below the entrance,
impressive for a cave that has never seen a PMI rack nor Gibbs.
Having Mike Artz lead the way out is non-stop, bust-ass caving. I'm sure glad that I
jog frequently. I was very suspicious (but secretly glad) of the frequent carbide change
stops on the way out. Praise the Lord that we all did not own Wheat Lamps.

Just as the night before the cave trip, we partied notoriously hard afterwards. In a
comatose state, I barely crawled into Mike's tent. I could not remember if I was wasted
from the caving trip, or if it was from the ludicrous amounts of beer and those imported
herbs. But it sure felt good.

Just before oblivion...
"Hey, Frank, want to go caving in Simmons-Mingo again?" "For sure," was my
reply, "For sure."
