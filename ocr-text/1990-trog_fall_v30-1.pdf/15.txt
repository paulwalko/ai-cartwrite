Is Caving All there is?
A reflection on dragons & other Mythical Beasts
I have met
Caving (as a trainee) involves mluch more than that: politics, personalities, meeting
landowners, etc. It also involves networking as one more part the VPI Grotto into the outer lands.
Consequently it entails many nites on the road, sleeping at roadsides, or hunting for (cheap)
sleeping places, driving slimy roads where only with the aid of a front wheel drive was I able to get
back to the interstate herringboning my way up the hill to find 3 days later (when the mud had time
to cure on the car's underbody) Ã  slit tire caused by a piece of gravel embedded in the concrete
quality clay.
During one stage of this caver's life when networking included western Tennessee and
Alabama cavers, & traveling particularly included western Tennessee caves. I was exhaused on
wet suit cavers, cavers who ore nothing under ther red suits in wet & cold caves, cavers who ridge
walk carrying the sum total of their caving gear "just in case", caving with a squabbling "couple".
who had caved together for years, looking for new pits and finding them weekly.
But back to dragons and othe mythical beasts (the earlier mentioned ones have been
documented as genuine). Driving west of Knoxville late one sunny afternoon with the sun roof
open I happened to feel something hot on the back of my neck. I looked in the rear view mirror
and saw nothing, I glanced out the windshield towards the sun-It was the wrong angle. Then I
chanced to look up spotting not far above me, an early 20th century bi-plane complete with a leather
& virsor clad pilot, scarf blowing in the wind- looking like he had plans for using my vechicle or
me-or that he was coming down to keep me company. Not being exceedingly paranoid, I waved &
moved on- the back of the neck continued to feel uncomfortable. I could'nt shake tis apparition.
Eventually I stopped at a rest stop & closed the sun roof so that I would neither be beamed up nor
be distracted by looking up- maybe he was trying to identify the caving garbage in the back seat
Moving on down the road towards home later another Sunday eve-it became road warrior time on
81-not another passenger car had disappeared in favor of more comfortable surroundings. I
usually get along well with the roaring, pushy, snarling motorists, but this time it was clearly
different. When we finally hit the Virginia border and the posted car 65/trucks 55 sign, someting
primevial in my road companion's psyche seemed to be triggered. An immediate slowdown first
and as I peacefully shot on ahead, but suddenly a roaring, nasty mob began setting in and around
me. As the road warriors vied for the winner position, weaving in and out, I made myself small. I
have a foreboding that they are colluding on their radios and pick me up between them and carry me
off. I know not where-but suddenly they drop back. I pull out for coffee and sugar jolt and I'm
back on the road hoping smokey follows me up the road.
A few miles out I am spacing out to loud music and a cool breeze and again I am engulfed
from behind. I only briefly thought of outrunning them-but it did keep me awake-up ahead
something different is happening-off to the right several trucks ahead (I am in the left lane), there is
a flash of light that gets brighter and brighter tearing away from the rear end of one of the trucks
flairing high and low. My hands freeze to the steering wheel (coffee and sugar activated) transfixed
by what appears to be a fire breathing dragon in its dying throes rapidly closing in on me. Will I
die with it as it thrashes and flashes to the death? I pray to any god there may be that its last flop
will not be onto the hood of the Le Caver and through the windshield and into my lap. Bracing
myself-I wait for my fate BLAM the car shakes-I shake, the dead dragon deflects to the left-and its
over. The road warriors have moved on ahead. I passively lower my speed and trudge on home to
sleep. ---Cecile James
