CAVING AND NUTRITION
by Ollie McKagen

There were five of us on my second trip, to Clover Hollow. We were in for a moderate nine
hours. Seems to me I was the only one who brought more water than that for the lamps. I also
took in a couple of sandwiches and some fruit. I ate and drank several times during the trip. While
at least one of the others grew steadily and obviously more tired, cold and clumsy (she also refused
my several offers of drink and a bite to eat), I maintained my alertness and strength. Only at the
last, waiting at the entrance pit for the rope to be clear, did I feel a bit of a chill. I was able to
excercise this off in a few minutes of jumping jacks, while the tired one struggled up the rope,
staggered to the vehicles and fell asleep instantly. Next day she ahd a cold and all the associated
miseries. I could have gone caving the next day, for as long. And I felt nothing but fine for a
week afterwards.
Caving is a highly energetic activity which places a lot of stress on the body. For comparison,
a highly trained athlete can run all day and night on 7000 calories. An average human doing
nothing spectacular physically needs about 1600 calories a day to simply maintain body weight.
During the above trip, with its rope work and rock climbing, this need would likely more than
double. The body heat lost to wet, cold rock and air would require still more energy, in my
opinion, up to another 150 calories per hour. The minimum sum of these approximate
requirements is over 4500 calories, and could be much higher in many cases. For a person going
without breakfast, this must come from the glycogen in the liver and later, after this is depleted,
from fat stores. (No-one can store a whole day's worth of glycogen.) While it does no harm to
shed some weight during a period of prolonged physical activity, it is certainly more efficient to
utilize food, rather than body fat, for energy needs. Burning fat requires that complex mechanisms
be involved in breaking it down to glucose. These aren't necessary in digestion, transport, and
utilization of food calories. Fat stroes are much more efficiently used for long term low levels of
calorie stress than for immediate heavy needs.
Americans usually consume a diet which is high on fats and protein. The above athlete, in his
7000 calories intook only 70 calories each of fat and protein. This is equal to about 18 grams
protein, and only seven grams fat. The rest was carbohydrates, which are the ideal fuel for the
body. Even pregnant women need only on the order of 25-30 grams protein per day. The rest of
us need about 20-25 at the most. Burning proteins for fuel results in production of lots of urea,
which can be flushed from the body only by lots of water. Folks who eat hyper amounts of
protein, like some misguided weight lifters I have known, are likely to overload their kidneys with
the excess urea, despite drinking ordinarily sufficient amounts of water. They will have pains and
infections as a result. That pizza or bigmac you had sometime in the last few days is tasty but not
nourishing: it is very heavy on fat, oversupplies protein, and is low on complex carbos. And,
while an atthlete in a research experiment may be able to use carbos in simple form, supplied on a
regular schedule, a person in a cave is better advised to use foods that are moderated with fiber, as
these release the fuel and other nutrients more gradually, retaining their effect for long periods
between snacks. Good choices are the carbohydrates found in whole wheat bread, potatoes (with
the skin), green veggies, etc. (Sounds like yer Mom, doesn't it??) It's worth knowing also that an
pple raises blood sugar faster than a slice of white bread, and holds it up more constantly. Most
fresh and dried fruit do much the same
None of us are likely to carry a fully nutritious meal into a cave, let alone breakfast, lunch, and
dinner. But there are some good compromises available. I was introduced to cheese bread by Paul
Kirchner. I carry it often. I have also seen several sacks of dried fruit in various packs. Both of
these are bulky but light. Some of the cavers I've been in with carry deli sandwiches, which may
be a bit of a mess before they are eaten, but which will nevertheless help your endurance. I also
see cans of ravioli/spaghetti/noddleos/etc. These are not high in fiber, but aare high in simple
carbos that hit fairly fast in a tired body. The canned goods route is heavier but less bulky. I
usually don't carry candy myself, but it will give one a boost (followed by a crash). Candy has the
advantage of high calories content per unit size/weight. Chocolate in particular also contains a
stimulant acting similar to caffeine. One or two bars would be fine, but save it for extreme fatigue
when you need to pick up quickly.
If carrying a lot of food into even a long trip isn't your bag, instead at least take along some of
