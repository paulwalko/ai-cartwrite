Grandpa should have beena caver...
he had the right clothes
Dear old Grandpa passed away a few years ago. He left behind a legacy of clothing, a legacy
my grandma has been giving to the grandchildren. She is so sure we'll find soomething to do with
them. Well grandma... you're right...we wear them caving!! Yep, there are workshirts, long
underwear, pants, gloves and boots.
The shirts are just the right color- grey. Durable too, they were cop uniform shirts from the
thirties!! (when cops were tough) There are pockets to put your junk in... you know- aspirin for
that hangover from Friday nite. Some of the shirts are flannel, a tough breed of flannel. The best
thing is that all the shirts are so big you can get that layered look. Afterall we must be fashionable
while in a cave. (Darling you look marvelous).
Then there is the long underwear. Long enough and big enough to cover the biggest caving
butts. Some are all wool and some are that quilted cotton stuff. I have bags and bags of it- I even
wear it to bed! Hey, I'm a newlywed, what else would I wear?)
Yep you'll be warm with Grandpa long underwear and shirts, but what about pants?? Well,
there are these two pairs. ONe is real thick wool and the other is like five layers of thick canvas.
The wool ones have big black and red checks and make you talk like Elmer Fudd... "oooohh dat
dwirty bwat" and the canvas ones weigh about ten pounds. Another downfall is the size, the
average Joe Shmoe would have to gain 100 pounds for them to fit... they're HUGE.
Grandpa had all types of boots, all with non-skid soles. We cleared a lot of snow in Detroit.
Some of the boots even have felt liners... he used these to hunt wabbits in the Elmer Fudd pants.
Unfortunately the boots did'nt fit me, aww darn.
Next are the gloves, you name the type he had them. I think Grandpa looked for long
underwear and glove sales. So there is a stock pile of work gloves and the liners to go with them.
I think grandma made them wear these when he cleaned up after the grandchildren, you never
know what kind of germs you'll get from kids that live in Virginia (oooh).
Grandpa had some of the accessories for caving too. Like rope and lanterns, not high tech
quality but it's tough. He had a lot of chains and pulleys too. (His chains were used recently to
help clear the Murder Hole entrance),
So I think Grandpa would have been splendidly dressed for caving. He would remember all the
good stores too, and tell them right away. Trip reports would last for hours. (Well maybe I
streched that a bit).
If you ever cave with me, you'll know I've brought my Grandpa along for the view... I'm
wearing his clothes!! Thanks for the caving gear Grandpa...
