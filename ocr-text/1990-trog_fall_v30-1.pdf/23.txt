This Land
(a caver's version)
Chorus:
G7
C F
This land is my land, this land ain't your land.
E
I've got a shotgun, and you aint gont none
O C - Am
If you don't get off, I'll blow your head off
G7
This land is private property
As I was walking near coon ridge Mountain
I saw above me the sign said no one
I saw below me that virgin valley (but)
This land is private property
It was a hunger, that drove me onward
Through poision ivy, and creeping briars
No one could stop me, I wanted booty (but)
This land is private property
I broke a clearing and found my quarry
The biggest pit seen in the whole damn courntry
When all around me a voice came sounding
This land is private property
I took off running, the rocksalt follwed
I thought I was safe, he had two barrels
And from behind me the voice kept shouting
This land is private property
My ass was burning, I did not turn back
Theard hound dogs, so I made some hot tracks
Dropped the survey notes, I'll have to go back (but)
That land was private property
