The Giles County Cave Survey
A Brief Summary of Spring Semester Activities
January 20th started out like any other weekend, up and about at the crack of noon
and off to the scenic limestone wilderness of central Giles County. Unable to find
anyone who wasn't already on a trip or who actually wanted to enter a cave that day,
Jim Washington and myself decided on a nice, lesiurely day of ridgewalking. We
chose what appeared to be a rather promising area abouve Sinking Creek at the
extreme soutwestern end of Clover Hollow, known locally as "The Brickyard". This
innocent sounding ridgewalk woud eventually result in the investment of over 300
caver-hours of digging, mapping and ridgewalking with no end in sight yet.
After about three hours of walking, we had found four entrances, including a large
one with a pit in it; and one friendly landowner. Returning to the truck, we found two
more large entrances right off the road where we had parked, which boasted our
ridgewalk to a respectable 2 CPH (caves per hour).
Six openings in one day seemed pretty good, so I returned on Sunday and found
five more. At this point, I decided that this area might be worth checking out more
thoroughly, so I returned the next weekend with Brian Bachman, Paul Kirchman and
Ollie McKagen to do some surveying. The largest entrance yielded about 50 metes of
passage and ended in a 12 meter pit with a meter of standing water in the bottom. The
next entrance we checked opened into a tandem pit complex. A hole in the bottom of
the first pit opened up into a second pit about 8 meters from it's bottom. The two were
also connected at the top, but movement by a large boulder which Paul and myself had
crawled under caused an abrupt shortening of the trip, leaving part of the cave
unexplored.
Two other holes in the area wer poked, but nothing interesting turned up, so we
called it quits after the landowner's daughter and her cousin showed us four entrances
they knew of. Ollie and I returned later that week to survey "Roadside Garbage Pit",
getting about 55 meters of passage and causing many garbage avalanches. We then
went to check out a fissure I had found during the week, but a cold rain had sapped
most of our morale, so after a minimal effort, we went to drink some beer.
Most of the next few weeks were spent ridgewalking, digging, and ridgetalking. By
the end of January thaw, I had met with almost every landowner in the Brickyard, and
permission to trespass from all but one. Obviously, this is a problem, although not a
really bad one. The biggest problem is getting people to go surveying, which is almost
as difficult as getting them to write trog articles. (Ed. note-no arm twisting was.
employed).
As of this writing, 10 caves have been mapped, and about 40 more digs and
entrances and digs need to be completed. Exams and my rejoioning of the labor force
have severely limited the excess time I have to spend in the Brickyard, but there's
always summer.
