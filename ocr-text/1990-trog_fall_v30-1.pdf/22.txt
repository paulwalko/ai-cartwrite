LETTER TO A TRAINEE
Dear Trainee-
It has come to my attention that you have been overheard complaining
about how difficult caving is. Apparently you don't realize what caving
used to be like whenl was a trainee.
Fiorst of all, we did'nt have caves. You can just hop in your car and
drive ou to a cave and go caving. When I was a trainee we had to dig our
own caves. But did we complain? Of course not! When I was a trainee we
were used to doing things the hard way.
We did'nt have carbide or electric lamps, that would have been too easy.
We used candles. And we did'nt strap them to our helmets either, we held
them in our mouths. We didn't strap them to our helmets because we didn't
have helmets, or boots. Or kneepads. Or clothes. We caved naked and we
loved it.
We never had any fancy vertical gear either. We did'nt have racks or
ropewalkers, we did'nt even have rope. If you could'nt climb it, you
could'nt cave it. If you got down someplace you could'nt get back up, you
did'nt whine and moap and wait for a cave rescue- you dug your way out in:
another direction!
And most importantly, when I was a trainee, members got respect.
When a member said jump, you said "how high?" When a member told :
trainees to form a human bridge over a gorge so he could walk across they
made the best human bridge that member had ever seen. If a member told a
trainee to rappell down a caynon upside down, he did it and thanked him
afterwards.
So don't let me ever hear you complaining again. Because when I was a
trainee, any trainee caught complaining was killed, a tradition that can
easily be revived.
Sincerely,
Old Fart
