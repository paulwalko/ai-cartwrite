Safety with Trust
Meredith Blanco
I was told after a walkie-talkie call saying “Holy f***” that I was next to go down the Fantastic Pit.
As I approached the pit, I grabbed the rope with forty pounds of rope weight, weaved it through my rack
with six spaced bars being my only attachment, and prepared myself for the descent. Phillip Moneyhun, the
president of the VPI Cave Club, told me that I had someone at the bottom holding the other end of the rope
to stop me from falling. So, I swung my shaking body over the 586 foot pit and contemplated all the
decisions that I have made up to this point in my life that led me to be under something in which I could not
see the bottom. I was terrified. I concentrated all my attention on the device attached to my harness. Slow-
ly, my hand moved the bars away from each other to create space in between them to allow the rope to move
and begin my controlled fall.
Knowing the type of gear that one borrows or purchases should allow someone to feel safe. This
feeling of safety with gear could be based on the brand or how much of the system the caver knows how to
use. One of the trainees I was with on the trip, Nathan Kearney, voiced his opinion on the topic of gear. I
asked him his thoughts on his ascending gear, descending gear, harness, and various other parts of his
apparel. He responded that, “Everything is made in factories where they know the exact breaking points and
exactly how and why they can fail and this gear is made for what we do. Therefore, it is made to withstand
the issues that we have.” With this, I can conclude that a point of trust that makes a trainee or caver feel
safe, in general, is the brand and manufacturer chosen when gear is used. Within the cave club, I have heard
and used gear from trusted brands named OnRopeOne, Petzl, Black Diamond, Zebra, Fenix, OLight, and
Gonzo Guano Gear. These brands have been tested in and out of caves by generations of cavers and profes-
sionals to ensure their users to have a safe experience when doing a dangerous sport.
By going on multiple cave trips, a trainee has the potential to become familiar with the experienced
members as well. On the Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia (TAG) trip, four members were present to the six
trainees. We, the trainees, as inexperienced cavers, put a lot of our trust in the members and ourselves to
keep us safe. Even then, some members still have to prove themselves to each other to gain a space of trust
to make other members feel safe in their presence. Reilly
Blackwell, the trip leader and a member of the VPI Cave Club,
mentioned that trust can be broken and that there are cavers that she
refuses to cave with- not due to lack of knowledge, but
overconfidence. She trusts Eric Lee Hahn, the current Vice
President of the club, to teach trainees the skills they need to know
and as a person to cave with in general. Phillip pointed out that he
not only felt uncomfortable caving with a completely nervous caver,
but a completely overconfident caver as well. If someone is not
aware of their environment and the dangers that it holds, the distrust
that they create leads to an entirely unsafe space for themselves and
the people around them.
In essence, safety is earned with factors including the trust of
one's gear and the people they surround themselves with while cav-
ing through experience and knowledge.
