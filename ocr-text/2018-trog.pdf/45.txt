Pizza, Helmets, and You: A Mis-Guide to Cave Nutrition
By Eric Steinberg
We've all been there. You've packed your lights, water, and some things to keep warm. Just one thing left:
food! The Annotated VPI Cave Club Bylaws are non-specific on this matter, stating “Everyone has their own
preference of caving food, from candy bars to spaghetti. See what others bring along, try different things,
and decide for yourself what works best.” In this article, we will examine what the average VPI caver brings
for food, and surely go off on a myriad of tangents which will leave the reader with no useful conclusions,
but at the very least, leave that reader a more broken and confused caver than before. Here we go!
A tightly controlled survey was conducted, and its results painstakingly examined to produce statistically
relevant data. Respondents ranged in age from 12-87, with an average of 36 years old. 54% were male,
28% female, 4% “attack helicopter”, and 14% “other”. 74% of respondents classified themselves as human,
while the remaining 26% are CHUD's. Participants were asked to rate the two snacks mentioned in the club
bylaws. “Spaghetti” received a disappointing 2.1/10 weighted average, and “Candy Bars” fared little better
at 2.7/10. Clearly the architects of our constitution had no clue about cave nutrition!
Survey participants were also asked about their personal preference for cave snacks, as well as the best and
worst snacks they have seen on cave trips. The most commonly packed cave snacks included nuts, trail
mix, energy/granola bars, candy bars (mostly Snickers), jerky, cheese sticks, fruit snacks, and PB&J
sandwiches. Other honorable mentions were tuna, sardines, cheeseburgers, avocados, bananas (also cited
frequently as the "worst” cave snack possible), “mini-bagels filled with cream cheese, grape jelly, and
Hormel canned ham-really”, ROCKS, blueberry poptarts, Cave Salamander Stew, egg sandwiches, Ensure,
“garlic roasted bat w/ fried crickets”, and helmet pizza.
Some interesting results and correlations are worth noting:
1. A whopping 36% of CHUD respondents identified tuna or sardines as the “worst” cave snake.
Perhaps we have discovered an effective CHUD repellant!
2. “Best” cave snack responses included: Edible Panties, Meat Tubes, Pie, and Rack Eggs. Imagine
that four-course meal.
3. The tears of trainees have adequate nutritional value for long cave trips according to one
respondent. Another suggests eating the slowest/weakest trainee, and other trainees' food while
they climb rope (use caution when caving long trips with this 47yr old male caver).
The most intriguing snack suggestion was, of course, helmet pizza. Disturbingly, only a few survey
respondents made mention of helmet pizza- this treasure must be shared! It's hard to determine when
helmet pizza was invented, but we do know that pizza was invented in 1889AD, and helmets were invented
in 900BC. While cavers will argue at length about the exact degree to which suspension helmets are
superior, no one can ignore the unique storage advantage of a hardshell suspension helmet.
Here is where the magic of helmet pizza resides. Follow this simple illustrated guide, and you too can enjoy
helmet pizza on your next cave trip!
