of resistance, and was twice forced to call for reinforcements from Paul. On the whole, things
were going well, and I was whistling as I went from one defense pod to another, ripping them
open and plucking forth the cowering, terror-stricken occupants.

Thad nearly decided the area clear of defenders, when I
spied one last pod, well hidden beneath some
discarded supply containers. I advanced with a shout
of triumph, tore at the fragile pod walls with malicious
glee, and nearly fainted! I reeled backwards, retching
uncontrollably as the despairing troops inside
released wave after noxious wave of garbage gas and
methane in my face! Retreating momentarily, I man-
aged to gasp some fresh air. Spurred by their
resistance, I buried my nose in the shoulder of my
jacket and attacked the flank. A fierce battle ensued;
bits of old sub buns, bad tomato, and sacrificed
Browns flew in various directions. It was tough going
for a while, but I somehow incarcerated the entire
group. I lurched weakly to the opening of the dump-
ster, gulping in the sweet fresh air of victory and free-
dom, thankful beyond words for my miraculous es-

We finished sorting, and having literally flattened the unruly pfc's (cans), turned our backs on the
gore-littered scene, leaving some early-morning employees of Daddy's Money gaping in
disbelief.
For more stories, younguns should ask Old Farts around a fire (they may not remember, but that
won't stop them from making something up). Collecting for the Miller Campaigns was a large part of
club lore and activities for several 'generations' of Cave Club members (at least 7 or 8 years).

CAVE CLUB
Following the initial win in the Spring of '75, the Club
"defeated all comers” the following Fall to win a fancy
console color TV. The Spring of '76 we won again with
138,000 points, which represented 51% of the total points
for the entire school combined! We won again in the Fall of
'76 and Spring of '77. Lest you think this was easy,
consider these numbers: near the beginning of the Spring

'77 Campaign, the Club made a turn in of 1,800 lbs of
bottles and 300 lbs of Aluminum cans for a cumulative
score of 36,500 pts. We finished the contest with a total score of 119,000 points (292,000 points for
every club in the school combined). You can do the math. Aluminum cans are about 25 to 30 per
pound. There were a lot of filled clear plastic Miller bags hauled!
From the Fall of '77 to Spring of 1980, there is little mention in the Minutes or Trogs of the Miller
campaign, so perhaps it was not held during that time period. However, the Treasurer's reports had
grown to report on both the Active treasury and Savings. From Fall of '77 to Spring '79 the Savings
part increased about $1k to a total of over $2,700. So perhaps some more contests were won
during that time, or it just took awhile to collect the money already won (like selling TV's and stereos,
when those were given instead of cash).
