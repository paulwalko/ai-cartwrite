Meanwhile, Joe continued and set another two more bolts getting 15 feet up the bolt climb. Joe
then hit a bad layer of rock and spent about 30 minutes hammer and digging around. Nick then went up
the climb, and hammered and dug around for a while as well. He eventually found some good rock and set
a higher bolt and got a few more feet up the climb. The darker layer about 18 feet from the floor that was
thought to be good
limestone turned out to be several feet of
dirt and mud. Nick started digging and
hammer all around trying to find where the
good rock was. Whenever a potential good
layer might have been found, the rock
eventually shattered and turned out to be
a larger piece of breakdown stuck in the
mud. Joe and Nick proceeded to trade off
digging and trying to find good rock, for the next 3 hours but where unsuccessful. To make the digging
more interesting, the mud bank that was being dug into was overhung and about 3 feet above the
person bolting. Scott enjoyed watching Joe or Nick rain down dirt, mud, and rocks on themselves. To
make it worse, you could see up the last 12 feet of the mud shoot into walking passage.
Much cursing and sighing was heard until the effort was forfeited around 4:45 pm. At around 5:10 pm,
Kelly and Andrew returned all a twitter with what they had found up
past the 20 feet climb. They delved into the details of what they found
and Joe and Nick started packing up some of the bolting gear for the
journey out of the cave.
Andrew and Kelly ascended the second (but first bolted) dome into
the unknowns of an upper level. Scott helped tie into the room below
with a tandem before the survey delved into the passage ahead. Kelly
sketched with Andrew on point and DistoX. At first the passage
fulfilled expectations, a narrow jagged contortion canyon baring
significant resemblance to the Buppet Puster below. However, a
couple of turns in Andrew spotted a lead to the left and climbed into
the crawl way to investigate. A large passageway was discovered 20
feet wide and covered in black stalactites, flow stone, and soda
straws. Full of enthusiasm and inspiration the team descended back
into the canyon to survey a few more stations before turning the
survey into the walkway above. At odds with the passage below the
upper section was covered in black mud and it was decided to follow
in the direction of the stream below. It was soon realized that the two
passages were winding back and forth connected via a number of
openings in the floor of the upper passage. The survey halted at an 11
feet drop off the edges coated in mud rendering them impassable,
but the stream (now barely connected puddles of muddy water) con-
tinued on 16 feet below in walk-able passage. Descending into the
steam passage, they were forced to turn back (having reached the time limit) and soon passed by the
last station in the canyon on the way back to the dome.
