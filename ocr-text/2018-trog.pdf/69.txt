These experiments point to the following conclusions but it is unknown if they
apply generally to all out-of-cal DistoXs or just to one that has drifted out in this
particular way on this particular survey course. Please see if you can replicate
these results with your own DistoX!
Conclusions
A DistoX is not an electronic Suunto and does not behave like one!
Averaging Backsights with Foresights will cancel out the effect of calibration
drift but only if YOU SHOOT BOTH SHOTS IN THE SAME
ORIENTATION!
Backsights will improve the closure of your loops over that obtained with
double foresights if your DistoX is out of calibration.
If your Foresights and Backsights do not agree, DON'T PANIC. It will still be
okay if you shoot Backsights in the same orientation. Do not cherry-pick
orientations in the cave to get better agreement; this will make you feel
better but will make the closure worse!
