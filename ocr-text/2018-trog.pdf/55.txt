We met up with Phillip and Clinton and headed back to camp. They had finished the bolt climb they started, but found that the ledge
they had climbed up to took them almost immediately to a 60-ft climb.
Friday 12/29/17
We got something of a later start on Friday, and headed back to the new area. Phillip and Clinton continued ahead to start the newest
bolt climb, and Reilly and I stopped at NU7 to start surveying to the room. The area is quite dome-y; there is a 70-ft dome with
potential for upper level passage in the first room encountered (NU9). We proceeded from the room through the breakdown until we
reached the new chamber where the other team was climbing. The survey of the room finished just before Phillip needed the bolting
gear our team was carrying – good timing. We climbed up the 20-ft rope rigged at the 1st climb (NU29), and offered advice and
commentary to Phillip as he finished the next 60-ft climb (NU31). He finished the climb, and rigged a static line up to the ceiling
channel he had reached. He declined to scoop his discovery, and generously offered the privilege to the survey team while he and
Clinton left the area to acquire more static rope. Mud may have been a factor. We set a meeting time at camp of midnight. Reilly
and I climbed up (and surveyed to the top), and quickly discovered an 80-ft pit (NU32). We were able to drag the rope we had just
climbed up and dropped it down the new pit. The rope reached with maybe a foot to spare, and we were able to place a survey
station there. Reilly went down first, and called me down to help her find a way to the shower we could hear close-by. I attempted
the tight, horribly muddy (by TN standards anyway) climb she had been looking at, and found that it 1) wasn't so bad and 2) popped
out into a new 80-ft dome with a small stream pouring down from the top. We pushed a little further from there, but determined
there was not enough time to survey and still make it back to camp at the agreed-upon time. Both of us enjoyed the climb up the pit
- the rope was unfazed by any rub points and the lip was exactly as pleasant as it had promised to be on the way down. Nobody
cussed. We finished the day with 27 stations (NU8-NU33) and 492 feet, counting a few splay shots in the room.
We met Phillip back at camp at 11:30 PM or so – Clinton had packed up and left the cave as had been previously discussed. We
brainstormed a little about what we could accomplish without being able to break up into two teams of two.
Saturday 12/30/17
We had reached a broad agreement Friday night that this would be our last full day of exploration, based on energy level and the
prospect of a New Year's Party. We agreed that I would solo-survey the dome-pit series we had found at the end of the last trip,
while Reilly and Phillip worked on a promising 60-ft bolt climbing lead in the large breakdown room.
Phillip came up to the top of the 80-ft pit with me to set a bolt or two and eliminate the horrific lip that Reilly and I had enjoyed the
day before. We then split up, and I started my survey. I did not discover any cave beyond what we had seen the day before – the
survey wrapped up in 8 stations and 88.8 feet of survey. Those numbers aren't made up. I did find that the muddy climb could be
bypassed with a longer rope and a bolt or two – a window half-way down the 80-ft pit at NU32 drops down into the waterfall dome
(NU 38).
After finishing my survey, I climbed back up to NU32 and considered my choices in life. The ceiling channel I was in continued
over the pit, and had appeared visible at the top of the waterfall dome. Pushing it could save a lot of potential work – so I did.
Awkwardly crawling over the drops using fairly slick, muddy footholds did not feel like a great idea, but it got me to the water
source for the dome. The water comes out of a too tight, gnarly canyon. There is a too tight belly crawl above it that is dry. There
was no noticeable air – it is not a lead that will keep me up at night.
I rejoined Phillip and Reilly, and spectated while Phillip finished his climb (near NU18). It was another 60 footer, and we left the
area close to midnight after reaching the top. There is a tight canyon at the top that still goes – no survey was done there. We packed
up the bolt climbing gear and headed back to camp. While at camp, I made a quick shot between S2 and SJ1. Clinton had been fairly
sure that the SJ survey had been mapped but left floating – if that is the case the data is now available.
Sunday 12/31/17
The trip out was uneventful. We made most of the right turns on the first try, and made it to the entrance 4 hours after breaking
camp. The BO crawl was a lot less pleasant going uphill. We exited at 3 PM to a sunset we enjoyed and bitter cold that we did not.
The trip totaled 100 hours, with 880 feet of total survey. We had a good time doing it – thanks to Clinton for showing us around and
thanks to Lonnie for providing access to such an awesome cave! We made it back to Blacksburg that night with just enough time to
stink up a caver New Year's party.
