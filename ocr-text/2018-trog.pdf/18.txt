Surprise, Surprise......
Peter Gioia
During spring break, Reilly Blackwell, Eric Hahn, Phillip Moneyhun, and Andrew Schoenwolf fearless-
ly led a group of trainees, Nathan Kearney, Meredith Blanco, Peter Morisey, Matthew Kok, and myself
through the caves and pits of TAG. We were extremely excited to go to Surprise Pit in Fern, our third cave
of the week. I was so excited I even volunteered to carry the 750' rope up the mountain first. I was doing
pretty well until we took a break and I sat down and fell over with the rope on my back. Sitting back up was
fun in itself.
We made our way through the cave until we got to the rig point for the pit. Mud sculptures filled
the ledges with items ranging from head sculptures to cars. We made sure to find a spot for a large “VPl” to
go up. Phillip began to rig to some strangely-angled iron hangers with a backup to a boulder. As Eric opened
the rope bag, he noticed that a creature had been stirring and it was a mouse. Out of the rope bag Eric
pulled yellow insulation: the creature's nest. We watched closely as he began to flake out the rope looking
for spots the mouse had gotten to. We found three spots where the mouse had chewed pretty deep and
tied knots to isolate them. The only question was whether those knots would be at the bottom of the pit
since it was only a 404' rig point and a 750' rope.
Phillip's ability to climb really fast was
put into good use in order to examine the situa-
tion. He discovered that there was only a single
knot about 50' off the bottom. The plan then
became that Eric would brave the heavy mist at
the bottom and belay the trainees who would
changeover before the knot and climb out.
Trainees who were strong with changeovers
would be the ones to rappel. Nathan was the
first trainee to go. Over the radio we figured out
that Eric was able to use his superior belay skills
to pull Nathan over to a tall pile of breakdown
to completely avoid the knot. This made things
much easier.

I was next to go. Now, Surprise was my first pit of that size, but I didn't think that made a
difference. After I got going and got a good feeling of my bars I began to enjoy the ride and look around. It
was overpowering. I began to feel emotional. Eric came over the radio and told me to turn off my lights as
he was going to turn his on. I stopped, got myself situated and Eric turned on his lights. I thought the pit
was overpowering before, but now it was completely different. The mighty pit made me feel microscopic.
The true power of nature finally hit me. A combination of this and the beauty of the pit brought me to
tears while I was on rope. I would've been sobbing by the time I got to the bottom, but I had to keep from
air rappelling. I gathered myself as Eric pulled me over to the breakdown. I signed the register and began to
