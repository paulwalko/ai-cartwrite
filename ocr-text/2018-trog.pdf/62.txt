4 Things I've Learned as a Rescue Nerd Turned Caver

as Charlie the Cave in Deschutes County, OR.
The National Cave Rescue Commission (NCRC) is the NSS's “representative on issues of cave
rescue training and operations" (ncrc.info/about). NCRC develops curriculum for cave rescue and
offers courses through national and regional training seminars aimed at both cavers and rescue
nerds. The “Level 1” course teaches you how to be a not-terrible team member on a rescue, "Level
2" tries to make you an adequate team leader. “Level 3” is designed for trickier rescue techniques
and to teach people how to manage the utter clusterf**k of a cave rescue incident. “SPAR" class is
for MacGyvers and “TOFE” is for wizards. I've had the glorious opportunity to attend or assist with
three NCRC training events in the past year and would like to share some of that knowledge for
those of you who haven't yet had the experience of being sandwiched between a litter and lava
rock (or any rock). See Photo 2.
Lesson #1: Always check your anchors, especially if they are lava. One of the cool things
about caving/attending seminars in different places is you get to experience caves with different
geology. The Level 1 course I attended was in Redmond, Oregon. Oregon's caves are lava tubes.
Lava caves pretty much feel like the opposite of our limestone caves. Lava is grabby and abrasive,
like velcro. Assume if you're touching it
