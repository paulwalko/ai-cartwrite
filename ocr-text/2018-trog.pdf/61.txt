With this new information, and looking at the sketches, it was decided that this upper upper level
area, that had been found, might very well connect to what Joe and Nick had been trying to bolt up into.
Just in case, the belay rope and gear was left in the cave for a future bolting trip â€“ ONLY after the upper |
evel had been checked to make sure it did not connect next time. The decision to leave a majority of the
bolting gear (minus vertical gear, drill, and batteries) in the cave made for a much more pleasant journey
back out the Buppet Puster. Andrew also enlarged some of the tighter regions of the stream canyon. As
usual, it took only 1.5 hours to get back to the main B survey and then another 1.5 hours to exit the cave.
The trip through the main passage was slow going, but uneventful. Everyone exited the cave at 9 PM on
Saturday.
The entire camp trip yielded a total of 1486.7 feet surveyed in the cave. Lastly, Bill Koerschner, Silas
Springer, and David Smallwood surveyed in the Sleeping Bag Crawl to J/W survey completing one of the last
major loops of the cave. Their survey of 468.3 feet brought the total surveyed length of the cave up to 9.01
miles!! With an original estimated mileage of 18 miles, Windy Mouth has reached the halfway point of the
resurvey project in slightly less than 2.5 years. The end of year goal is to have Windy Mouth at 10 miles by
the end of 2017.
