Cave Charcuterie
Kyle Nenninger
I love food. More specifically for the purposes of this article I'm into cured meats, charcuterie, and generally
anything I can create and carry in a pack for an indefinite period of time. Needless to say I spend a lot of
time thinking about what food to take with me into a cave, but what about food that can be produced in a
cave? Better yet, what about food from a cave to be eaten in a whole different cave? Historically caves
have been used for cellaring food, to the extent that cheeses such as Roquefort have a protected
designation of origin and must be aged within specific caves under EU law, but what could I accomplish in
my own back yard?
I had some specific concerns regarding aging food in a cave, namely that I would lose the degree of control
over the environment that I would have had aging it in a converted cooler or even a cellar. That said there
has been a lot of great research coming out in recent years about biodiversity in caves due to the rapid
appearance of white-nose syndrome in 2006-2007, and there's something to be said for knowing what
you're up against. Notably in 2013 the International Journal of Speleology published "A world review on
fungi, yeasts, and slime molds in caves," a compilation of existing research. This review lists more than 1000
cave-dwelling species, ranging from the bacteria responsible for botulism, tetanus, Weil's disease, as well
as flesh-eating varieties and the fungus responsible for histoplasmosis or "Cave disease." Well that doesn't
sound even slightly fun.
The important thing to remember, though, when working with and around bacteria is no matter what you
do your food will become contaminated, and you need a strategy for dealing with that. There are a few
options here: you can consume the food before the bacteria gets to problematic levels, you can kill the
bacteria (and, if it produces toxins, denature them), and you can find ways to halt or slow its growth. For
things aged in a cave #1 is out by default, and #2 becomes problematic as it most commonly requires fire.
This leaves us with #3: creating conditions that are otherwise hostile to undesirable organisms.
According to the USDA temperatures lower than 42F (equivalently refrigerator temperature) prohibit
organism growth sufficiently that food held at these temperatures will remain safe for consumption for a
more substantial period of time. Caves are not this cold - averaging 50F around SWVA - but this isn't as hard
of a line as it's portrayed, and temperatures below 60F still do something to inhibit growth.
The pH of an environment, how acidic or alkaline it is, has a fairly wide range of effects on potential
infections. Most commonly when speaking of pH it's in relation to growth of lactobacillus and similar
"probiotic" lactic acid-producing bacteria responsible for the fermentation of everything from yogurt to
kimchi to summer sausage. With the use of a starter culture, and salt, we create conditions that allow these
bacteria to acidify their environment quickly enough that they are able to out-compete other, less desirable
species.
