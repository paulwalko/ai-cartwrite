What Does the NSS Do?
By Reilly Blackwell, VPI #461, NSS #68044
Legend has it that what the National Speleological Society mostly does is waste time and money.
While I can't say that never happens--all cavers are accomplished time-wasters and
chit-chatters--in my time working at the headquarters of the Huntsville Good Ol Boys' Club I've
gained some perspective on how the NSS benefits the caving community as a whole. Two obvious
contributions are Convention, a yearly gathering of cavers from all over the country, and the NSS
publications (NSS News, Journal of Karst & Cave Studies, and books published through the NSS),
which keep us all up to date on some of the Cool Stuff happening in the American underground.
Here are some others I've become familiar with recently:
The NCRC
The National Cave Rescue Commission is chartered by the National Speleological Society.
Many VPL members received NCRC training this fall in the form of Level One or Small Party
Assisted Rescue. As cavers, the responsibility to participate in and run cave rescues falls on our
shoulders, and rescue training is an invaluable resource to ensure that we have the necessary
skills. Having accessible rescue training also makes us safer and more competent cavers,
reducing the number of rescues that happen in the first place.
The Library
By far the best room in the whole NSS Headquarters is the Library, which is run by Bill Torode, a
legendary Alabama caver. If you're ever in town, it's worth stopping by and hoping Bill is feeling
friendly enough to talk; he's got some great stories, some of which are even true. While you're
there, you'll have a chance to see the incredible store of knowledge and history the NSS Library
contains. Every grotto newsletter since 1941 is preserved there, and every Convention guidebook
and NSS bulletin. The National Cave Files are sixteen filing cabinets full to the brim with maps and
survey data from across the country. One of the shelves is devoted to academic theses on
hydrology, karst, and cave biota. Newspaper articles about caving have their own filing cabinet,
and informational texts written by cavers for cavers fill another entire shelf. There's a room full of
slides donated to the NSS by cavers past and present. Basically, if there's information you want on
caving history, cave science, or the activities of cavers in the United States, the Library has it
collected and organized for you to use.
The NSS doesn't collect all the maps that have ever been produced in the United States, because
survey organizations don't report directly to the NSS, but the NSS has huge collections of maps
that have been donated by older cavers. I spend my days in the Library surrounded by more maps
than I've ever before seen in one place. As surveyors and cartographers I think it's important to
