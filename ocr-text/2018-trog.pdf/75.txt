How and Why to Get Hypothermic
By Nathan Kearney
"Wanna go get hypothermic?” That's how our trip started. Within 5 minutes of entering Grim
Tawney's, we had just slipped through a tiny hole in the bottom of a crater only to be met with a
slippery slope that was inconveniently lacking anything to grab hold of. After sliding down as slowly
as possible, I came to see Joker crouched over a short stream at the base of slope. The
adrenaline just began to spike as soon as I heard him say "Oi! Fack me!”
We spent all of three hours crawling through the thickest baby poop mud on hands and knees,
except for Gillian. The best word to describe what she was doing would be wallowing. Where some
of us only got brown up to our elbows, she was completely covered up to her chin. It felt like we
swam through hundreds of yards of this nasty, slimy, cave slop! I probably ate as much food in the
mud as I did on a leisurely survey trip. We had gotten so cold, that Joker's promise to catch
hypothermia came close to true. The whole time, we were shivering, but continuing kept us warm.
Wool and polypro layers were my best friend. By the time we got out, we were basically brown
slop monsters, sprinting through the freezing temperatures back to the car. There has never been
anything as satisfying as getting out of sloppy cave gear and into the warmth of Joker's truck.
Now a little bit about Joker. He had told us so many stories about his shenanigans from New
Zealand and the land down under, that in my mind, he always has a bad Australian accent. He had
taken us under his wing and wanted to show us everything caving had to offer. For anyone who
doesn't know this man, make sure you meet him and get him talking. You'll have no idea what
you're getting yourself into, but it is always exciting.
The moral of this story: If anyone ever asks
you if you want to go get hypothermic in a
cave, especially Joker, say YES!
