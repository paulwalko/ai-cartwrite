thought sport caving was grim, try rescue caving!
Sometimes the best way to move a litter is to literally
(yay puns) lay your body on the ground and slide the
litter across your back or chest. You do this if the
passage is either (a) too difficult/rocky/etc. for 6
people carrying the litter to walk without falling or
dropping the patient, or (b) too bumpy/rockylawful to
slide the plastic litter across without losing half of the
plastic to the cave. The special term for this is called
"paving". Being a “paver” is like laying on a bed of
nails with a 200 pound weight on top of you. Double
fun! (photo credit: Caroline Bull)
you won't be able to slide. It destroys your gloves.
It steals your soles (of your shoes). Also, lava rock
is generally quite porous: BFRs that would usually
be bombproof anchors in limestone could be
moved and picked up with far less effort than you
would imagine.
Lesson #2: There are some things a caver can
do that most rescue nerds can't (or wouldn't
think of). The Level 2 class I attended near a
town called “3 hours from Starbucks” in Texas
was comprised half of people who would consider
themselves cavers and half of people who would
consider themselves rescue nerds (mostly fire-

a firefighter and firefighters thinking I was a caver. All it really meant was that I got to show off to
the firefighters my dark sense of humor, my A+ dirty jokes and my nimble wriggling skills that I only
developed by spending time underground answering the question “Will I fit through that?”. Texas
caves are strangely small and full of opportunities to chimney, wiggle and otherwise slither your
way into places some of the burlier rescue nerds' harnesses wouldn't even fit. Rescue nerds need
cavers.
