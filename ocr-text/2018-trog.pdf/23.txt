Can and bottle collecting was often done on pleasant (or not) Spring and Fall weekday afternoons.
It was an activity you could engage in most places you found yourself, even with only an hour or
two to spare. It did not even require leaving town, as late night (or early morning) forays into the
dumpsters behind the downtown bars could prove quite profitable. Perhaps the biggest advantage
the Cave Club had over frats was much less reluctance to dive into dumpsters and other Izod-less
locales.
Many War Stories were told of the most heroic efforts at
collecting cans. My own best War Story was a
dumpster I found containing a whole bunch of trash
bags apparently from the same household. The con-
tents were almost exclusively two items: beer cans and
used baby diapers. There was speculation that some-
one was not bonding well with new parenthood. None-
theless, that find was a rich source for empty aluminum
cans, and yours truly harvested them all.
In some early morning downtown hours, behind
Daddy's Money (a local bar of the time), “Big John”
Lohner and some others found a nice stash of
containers. John waited while the others went to get a
vehicle for transport. In the meantime some fraternity
guys came upon the same containers and were
exclaiming at their good luck. Big John, who was no
small boy, puffed himself up a bit bigger and said "boys,
those cans are mine”. Apparently he did it convincingly
enough that he was still in possession when the others
arrived with the vehicle.
The following excerpt is by Dave Shantz, from the Fall 1980 Trog (w/Paul Kirchman):
"I think we just found a bunker, Dave. I can see a lot of them from here." "Oh, yeah'? Well, let
me grab a bag and we'll see how many we can capture. It does look pretty good!"
Paul and I jumped eagerly into the twin dumpsters, having taken only a small number of enemy
personnel in the two previous sorties earlier in the day.
We found them to be a determined and devious lot, with several nasty tricks up their sleeves.
We attacked them with cries of "You'll not escape! I see you under that rotten head of
lettuce!", and "We'll get you! No use mingling with the Browns!" (The Browns are a cowardly
bunch, lending help only when they think they won't be discovered, but they can be a real
nuisance. However, we passed them by for the real fighters.) Some of the Hessians [clear
glass], in their desperation to escape, committed suicide rather than face the humiliation of a
trip to the reclamation center. Others burrowed into a half-baked pizza (with topping!), getting
themselves so entangled that we decided they were worse off where they were, and offered
no release.
Paul soon secured his dumpster and retired to the pickup bed to sort and classify the prisoners according to
concentration camp destination. I was still encountering pockets
