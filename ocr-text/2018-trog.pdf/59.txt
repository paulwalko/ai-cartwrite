The alarm went off at 7 am and
everyone stirred and slowly started getting
up. Nick got up first and started boiling the
water for breakfast! After breakfast, camp
was packed up and stowed until next time.
The plan was to leave the cave that evening
and travel back to WVACS to allow Scott to
visit with folks who haven't seen him in 8
months. No one wanted to wake up at 5 am
on Sunday to make the 9 am meeting either.
With 4 industrial garbage bags sealed with
desiccants and stored, everyone left camp and made for the waterfall room and on to the L survey.
It was a quick 30 minutes for everyone to get to the turn off, and
once there gear was re-organized between packs and people so a full
extra rigging bag did not need to be hauled up the Buppet Puster. Joe
had his food and extra clothes stored in everyone else's pack, while he
carried the bolting gear as his pack. Three sets of vertical gear were
brought: two for the bolting team and one to be shared by the survey
team going up the second dome. With much cursing, grunting, and
complaining, it took approximately two hours to go the 900 feet to the
domes. Moving through the passage has gotten easier because the way
up and down the narrow slot canyon is becoming more obvious with
the additional travel in this area of the cave.
At the 30 feet dome room, everyone dropped their packs and
broke into two teams. Andrew and Joe got geared up to start the bolt
climb while Nick, Kelly, and Scott headed to the 20 feet climb for Nick
to clean the route and make sure a bolt was ok. Nick climbed up, fixed
the bolt, and then was able to retrieve 5 hangers from the climb.
Arriving back at the 30 feet dome, Joe had successfully set 2 bolts and
was making his way up the pit. Nick took over belaying Joe from An-
drew, and him and Kelly headed up the other rope and started survey-
ing the new cave!
