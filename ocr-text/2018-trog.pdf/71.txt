Figure 1. A dog-faced fruit bat (Cynopterus brachyotis) in flight. (a) Beginning of downstroke, head forward, tail backward, the whole
body is stretched and lined up in a straight line. (b) Middle of downstroke, the wing is highly cambered. (c) End of downstroke, the wing is
still cambered. A large part of the wing is in front of the head. (d) Middle of upstroke, the wing is folded toward the body.
These types of flow phenomena are important because their strength and position can be related to
the magnitude and location of aerodynamically generated lift on a wing. The wake vortex found comprised
of a wing tip vortex as well as a vortex shed from the middle of the wing. These vortices also varied in
strength as function of time. This meant that the variation of the lift in time could be related to wing shape as
it changed during forward flight.
However, in the conclusion of this experiment the researchers admitted that still much work is to be
done in this area. The kinematics of bat flight still has not been fully described and understood. Further,
much more work is needed to relate the shape and position of the wing to the aerodynamic forces it
generates. Thus we can begin to see how complicated the motion of bats flight is and how it can be used as
inspiration to develop flying vehicles capable of extreme complex aerodynamic maneuvers.
