A canyon comes in now - the second you've seen.
The floor opens up, but the drop's not too mean.
Climb carefully downward, but watch where you tread;
A slip in the mud and you might wind up dead!
You're down now (and living) but boy, you are pooped!
You've walked and you've climbed; you've crawled and you've stooped.
You're bruised and you're scratched and your muscles are sore,
But the spelunker in you just hollers for more.
The passage you're in is the largest one yet.
A thirty-foot ceiling - the floor's mostly wet.
The breakdown is covered with slippery mud,
You discover how slick as you land with a thud!
The "Junction Room"'s next. Decide now once more
To go right or go left; to go aft or fore.
A stream wanders down from the left passageway
Enticing you there over breakdown and clay.
You walk and you crawl over mud-covered rock,
This trip has now lasted five hours by the clock.
Your eagerness dies as the passage grows small -
It's a long hard trip back so you sadly recall.
Pass up all the other ways, pass them all by,
Go back past the "Junction Room", back to the "Y".
Stop for an apple, a shared candy bar;
Delicious, though bruised up - you've dragged them so far.
Though tired and bedraggled, you've just got to know
What lies up the right of the "Y", so you go
Deeper again into Windy Mouth's guts -
You're determined to see it: no ifs, ands, or buts.
