recognize the value of an organization that stores and organizes the work done by generations of
American cavers.
Campground
The Spring Break TAG trip this year spent its first 3 nights camping (it's free for NSS members) at
the NSS Headquarters. It is an easy place to car-camp with access to restrooms and outlets. It is
also remote enough to facilitate plenty of car-horn honking when your tripmates don't wake up on
time. Meredith Blanco would like you all to know that "triggering the horn on Matthew's car was a
great pastime and was effective to annoy people with. Button pushing at its finest!” Testimonials
about the quality of the campground include “Not awful” and “Better than the Blue Hole.” There are
cooler campgrounds in TAG, but making the drive back to Cavers' Paradise after an Ellison's trip is
more likely to put you in the running for the Good Driver than it is to be fun, and the NSS
campground has everything you need to be reasonably warm and comfortable before driving 30
minutes to some of the country's nicest caves.
Supporting Young People!
This is perhaps a biased perspective, but the NSS made it possible for me to move to Huntsville,
Alabama for five months and hang out at HQ, work on caving-related books and articles, and go
caving four days a week. The most useful function of the NSS is that it's an organization that cares
about the future of caving and cavers in the United States, and it is comprised of smart cavers with
good connections who want to help you out! Many people who spend their time working with the
NSS are no longer active cavers, but a lot of them were very accomplished cavers at one time or
another, and all of them are committed to spending their time and effort to benefit caving in the US.
The NSS should not be overlooked as a resource, especially if you're just getting started and want
information or opportunities to cave in the USA far away from your home grotto.
