Dehydration is important enough to discuss on its own, as it's the hardest mark to achieve quickly and well,
but arguably the most important for the long-term creation of shelf-stable food. According to the USDA
food with water activity of less than 0.85 does not pose a health hazard under any storage temperature. To
give you an idea of where this ranks: hard cheese is ~0.92 Aw and grocery store-grade salami is ~0.87 Aw
(true salami is closer to ~0.82 Aw). While caves are certainly damp places, dry air is not necessarily better
as too dry of conditions will cause a rind to develop that can then trap moisture. To boot: that caves
naturally breathe and circulate air with weather fronts make ideal conditions for curing meat.
Curing meat through the use of salt and treatment with smoke are time-honored traditions with rich
histories. Salt and saltpetre, the latter for the nitrite and nitrate content, have been used for food storage
since prehistory to prevent the growth of the bacteria that causes botulism. Smoking meats provides the
second part of this defense, helping inhibit mold growth and infection by parasites. In more recent years
hops have also been shown to be effective at controlling the growth of gram-positive bacteria (most
notably not E.coli, but inclusive of most other bacteria relevant to food and caves).
Taken alone any individual item from the above would be beyond what I could reasonably rely upon in a
cave; however, studies by the USDA have found that these methods used in conjunction are just as
effective. Specifically, research from 2003 on summer sausage shows that a combination of water activity
less than 0.96 (think cheddar cheese), a pH less than 5.3 (less acidic than coffee), and at least 4.5%
water-phase salt will create a product resistant to harmful bacteria.
I've taken a trial run making a fermented sausage called landjaeger at home, and I'm happy to report that
three months later I'm still enjoying it, uncooked, without ill effect. I've submitted my recipe for publication
in this edition of the Trog for those who are curious. Now, to find a cave to hang the second round...
