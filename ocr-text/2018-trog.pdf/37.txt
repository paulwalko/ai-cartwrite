Push onward and inward, duck-walk where you must
Over water, through mud, over rocks, and through dust.
The height of the passage, the shape of the wall
Says you're approaching the famed "Hero Hall".
Pause here for a moment, pay homage to fame -
In mem'ry of him from whom "Hall" takes its name.
Now onward again down the back-breaking strand,
You swear it's the longest low crawl in the land.
A parallel passageway's seen on the right.
Ignore it and scramble on deeper in spite
of interesting gypsum and anthodites there.
A half-mile long crawlway - too much wear and tear!
It's long and it's mean; the floor's covered with stones
That bruise you and cut you and jab in your bones.
The wiggling and squirming, the long belly-crawl
Combine to persuade you to by-pass it all.
Ahead it grows higher, you walk upright awhile.
It's hard to believe you've gone less than a mile.
A pause now for rest and to carbide your lamp,
To lie down and stretch out, relieving that cramp.
Still onward and indward - the first canyon's ledge
Is conquered. You're down now; turn left by the edge
of a stream trickling past an unusual sight:
A cluster of helictites - tiny and white.
Now back to the main cave, still stretching ahead.
Walk onward - there's lots left to see, reports said.
The "Y" is at hand now - which way shall you try?
First leftward; the other you'll see by and by.
