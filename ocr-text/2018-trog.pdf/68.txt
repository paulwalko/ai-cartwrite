Now let's examine the loop closures shown in Table 2. They range from 2.2 ft for
Display Up Double Frsts to a miserable 9.9 ft for Display Left Double Frsts. The
Display up loop would be good enough for most cave surveys – after all it's only
a cave map! The 9.9 ft would surely cause scowls and perhaps objects to be
thrown in your direction.
So, what is the effect of averaging Foresights and Backsights? It drops the
horizontal closure error from 2.2 to 0.2 ft for Display Up. Now for the unex-
pected – shooting backsights and averaging the shot for the really bad Display
Left orientation drops the closure error from 9.9 to 0.5 ft. Holy Frig Batman!
This closure improvement was seen in all orientations.
Does this work if you average foresights with backsights shot in different
orientations (Table 3)? Up Frst with Down Bkst is 2.8 ft off; Down Frst with
Right Bkst is 5.1 ft off; Right Frst with Left Bkst is 9.1 ft off. The answer is HELL
NO! Do not ever average a Frst and a Bkst shot in different orientations unless
your DistoX is in perfect cal (which it is not!) Paradoxically, these mismatched
orientations can have better Frst/Bkst agreement (see R Frst/L Bkst in Table 1).
but result in worse closure. Gee Toto I guess we are not in Suunto Land
anymore! Apparently only Frst/Bkst pairs shot in the same orientation will
properly cancel out calibration drift. Backsights have an important function in a
DistoX survey beyond simple blunder detection.
The last 2 rows in Table 3 show the effect of averaging Frsts shot in flipped
orientation (eg. Up & Down). This method seems to improve closure over
regular double Frsts but not as much as averaging a Bkst for most orientations.
So what about the Euro method? Averaging all the Frst orientations for each
survey vector yields a loop closure error of 1.5 ft. Combining these with the 4
Bksts drops the closure error to 0.2 ft. Clearly this method works, but the
effect of averaging in the Bksts appears to be much greater than the effect of
averaging Frsts in all orientations. On this course, shooting one Bkst in the Up
orientation is as good as shooting and averaging 8 orientations (and much
more efficient). Perhaps a course with more vertical extent would show a
different result – future experiment.
