ODE TO WINDY MOUTH CAVE
A trek through the woods, a steep climb ahead -
The Windy Mouth visitor faces with dread.
When puffing and panting he arrives at the top,
The most hardy of cavers is ready to stop.
A gulping for breath, a creaking of bones,
A shifting around for a seat on the stones.
Now rest for a moment and charge up your lamp -
And remember the knee pads you left back at camp!
There's stirring around you, the others are ready.
The air's full of tension, excitement is heady.
There's big cave ahead you know from reports,
There's canyon and crawlway - there's cave of all sorts!
The entrance yawns lowly, so down on all fours -
Your buddy has knee pads, you wish you had yours.
You enter "The Big Push" now eager to see
What lies ahead darkly, mysteriously.
Forever you crawl, at least so it seems
To your poor aching kneecaps that conjure up dreams
Of cushions and padding or some other thing
To soften the bruising and take out the sting.
You crawl and you duck-walk nearly nine hundred feet
First banging your head, and then scraping your seat.
And just when you feel that you surely can't last,
There's head room ahead - you scramble on fast!
It's "walking cave" now, you don't mind the damp
Or the mud or the breakdown that's shown by your lamp.
Side passages open to left and to right
There's more cave ahead dimly seen in your light.
