Weigh your sausages and record it - we'll be using this to tell when they're done.
This sausage is traditionally pressed, and I find that I prefer the texture
when it is. Unpressed it's somewhere between a bologna or liverwurst,
but coarsely ground and not at all unpleasant. If you choose to press
them: make sure your equipment is clean or plastic-wrapped, and while
I've heard lumber works well I used textbooks and cookbooks. Pressing,
depending on the amount of pressure used, will take 8-12hr, but its fine if
it runs over as long as you make sure the sausages don't dry out.
The first 48hr of these sausages' lives, because lives they have again with
the introduction of the culture, you will want to keep them moist, out of
the light, and at room temperature to give the bacteria culture time to get
started. Hang the sausages together on S-hooks or what-have-you, and a
cut-up black plastic drum liner I've found works well to protect them and
maintain humidity. Check them every few hours, and spray with a bottle
of water as needed. Too wet is preferable to too dry at this stage.
After initial fermentation, cold-smoke the sausages over something mild
(not mesquite) for 2-4 hours. On top of being delicious, this step greatly increases the sausages' resistance to mold. If
you don't have the setup for a cold smoker you can use a tray of ice to try to keep the temperature of the sausages
below 100 F, although anything up to 120 F isn't catastrophic. If your temperature starts to creep to 120, however,
pull the sausages out and put them under ice to stop the cooking process.
From here, you'll need to ferment the sausages somewhere damp, with decent airflow, and at cellar-ish
temperatures (or in a cave!) Up until about 58 F is safe, 48-50 FI consider ideal, and anything lower won't hurt but
will make the fermentation take longer and produce a less-tangy sausage. Cellars are ideal, converted refrigerators
work great, and I've even done it in a large cooler before. Put a shallow bowl of water in the bottom of your "cave" to
increase the humidity, and be sure to change the air twice a day by either opening the door for a few minutes or
MacGyver'ing a fan into the mix.
Check your sausages frequently: you should not see any signs of the skin drying or tightening for at least the first two
weeks, and if you do it would be worth lightly misting them with water. White mold is typically ok, but if you see any
other colors you should promptly wipe it away with a clean cloth and a diluted vinegar solution.
After the first week and a half weigh your sausage again, and you should see a drop of 5-8%. You can start reducing
the humidity of their "cave" from here - once they reach 85% of their original weight they are good to eat, although
you can certainly dry them for longer.
