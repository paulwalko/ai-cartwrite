At 3:00 PM, Nick, Andrew and Scott made way to the upper levels to pick up off where Nick and
Scott had left the ME survey going back in January 2017. The way to the upper level section includes a very
sporty trip involving walking, hands and knees crawling, belly crawling, climbing, and canyoning.
After a 50 ft belly crawl, you rejoin the stream and the
Junction of Black Water Falls and a narrow 30 ft tall
stream canyon. Traveling up the canyon involves lots of
stemming at various levels to avoid the water and break-
down chocks. Another sporty climb at the M junction and
then a bedrock crawl to the Gold Line Showers Room.
There is also a bit of exposure in this room, named for
the old Gold Line and Cable ladder used to ascend a 25
foot waterfall pit. Luckily
there is a shelf you can scoot along to avoid climbing the very broken ladder and sketchy rigging from back
in the 1960's. After the climb, a bit more stream crawling brings you to the ME survey which is nice walking
passage with very pristine formations and flowstone on the right wall. It takes approximately 40 minutes to
get to the lead from camp, which was known to be the furthest point in the cave at 2.15 miles from the
entrance.
With Nick doing sketch, Andrew doing front sights and
cross sections, and Scott doing point and back sights, the
survey started! After completing a small loop around a
flowstone pillar, where the tie-in to ME existed, the team
continued into nice walking canyon with flat contact ceiling
and a small trickle of water meandering down the middle of
the passage. Scott checked out a few low wet leads which will
need some survey at some point. The survey slowed a bit
when the passage got complicated when the contact ceiling
disappeared into a breakdown room. After some cursing from
the sketcher and an awkward climb into a phreatic mud
section to the right of the room, the loop was completed.
The character of the passage changed again. What
was most noticeable were the waterfalls coming out of a
crack in the ceiling in two sections of the cave passage. It was
also noticeably more wet and colder. Moving forward, past
the waterfalls, the formations in this area of the cave
increased greatly as well as the ceiling became very tall:
averaging about 15 to 20 ft tall.
