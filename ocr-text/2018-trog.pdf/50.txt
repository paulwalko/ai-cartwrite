“Aragonite is lame, I want to grow calcite!”
You can't grow calcite. Well, you could, but you'd need lab equipment or a hundreds or thousands of years
to wait around.
This is the case for many of the mineral formations that occur in caves.
Gypsum crystals, for example, can be grown in a lab or extremely
slowly by nature. Gypsum is not particularly water soluble and apply-
ing heat does little to increase the solubility. To dissolve gypsum you'd
need to start with hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, otherwise you'll be
waiting around a long time.
Many cave formations, including those composed of carbonates, are
created very slowly and under conditions that are hard to replicate at
home. This makes the formations in our caves that much more special!

Other crystals to grow at home
Crystal growing is a popular hobby and has a huge amount of information available online. Minerals and
crystals can be grown through evaporation, suspension of a seed or object into a solution,
electrodeposition, or a number of other methods.
Trecommend that beginners in the hobby experiment with growing the following crystals before turning
their garage into a crazy crystal-growing laboratory:
Borax
•
Alum
Monoammonium Sulfate
Bismuth (metal with a low melting point)
Magnesium Sulfate
Copper Sulfate

If buying chemicals and ruining all of the cups in your house with saturated solutions and molten metal
doesn't sound fun, there are a slew of crystal growing kits available online.
So go ahead, cover your bookshelf with responsibly obtained crystals. Bask in the beauty of your new
shiny rocks that resemble the old shiny rocks we all love so much!
