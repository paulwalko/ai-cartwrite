HALLOWEEN AND EASTER BEER
Two fantastic events hosted by our generous landowners at the Bat Ranch. Mika and Ava have been hosting
the Halloween party and Easter Beer event at their property since most of us young-timers can remember.
Both events involve camping, bonfires, hot tubs, creek-runs, road clean-up, and sometimes even a little cav-
ing.
Halloween features wild costumes and decorations, and cavers go all out with individual outfits and group
costumes. For Halloween 2017, the landowners even constructed a magnificent bat effigy, which was burned
to appropriately celebrate All Hallow's Eve. Each year Ray Sira shares his costume photo collection with the
club.
Easter Beer features a special Easter hunt for tinfoil-wrapped beer and other goodies hidden around the
property for visitors to find. For many of us, it's the first time we emerge from our winter dens and caves to
bathe our pasty-white bodies in the spring sun. Both events also provide a valuable opportunity for the club
to give back to the landowners and community by cleaning litter off our adopted road, Zell's Mill. Members
and trainees both turned out in force to help clean the road of cans, wrappers, and sometimes even a dead
animal or two double-stuffed into a garbage bag.
Just ask Randolph, I think he may have gotten critter-juice on him.
