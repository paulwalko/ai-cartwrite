Bats: Pilots of the Underground

Bats: The defacto spiritual animal of all cavers. These damn cute creatures not only eat annoying
insects but are also extremely talented pilots. Imagine some of the places you may have seen bats, deep in
passages past many tight twists and turns. To be able to fly in these confined spaces bats must have
incredible maneuverability as well as the ability to hover. These unique creatures have incredible
aerodynamic control that is a direct result of the complicated structure of their wing and the inherently
unsteady dynamics of their flapping flight.
This fact has not gone unnoticed by researchers. Recently a group at Brown University
performed experimental measurements on bat flight in order to study the kinematics of the wing motions as
well as the flow structures in the wake behind the bat. To achieve this, the researchers in this study took high
-speed video of straight, forward flight as well as PIV measurements of the resulting wake. PIV is an
acronym for a flow imagining technique called particle imagine velocimetry. This technique allows the
calculation of the magnitude and direction of velocity vectors in a given imaged area. For this technique to
work a flow is impregnated with tiny particles called seed. A high power light source, usually in the form of
a laser sheet, illuminates a slice of flow while a high speed camera takes a picture of the illuminated seed
particles. Two pictures of the flow are taken in quick succession and loaded into a software program. The
position and direction that each particle moves in between images is calculated on a statistical basis. By
knowing the distance and direction each particle travels as well as the time between images, a velocity vector
at each point is calculated.
Lesser short-nosed fruit bats were the subjects of all tests. These natives of Southeast Asia natives
were chosen because they do well in captivity and respond well to handling and training. During the tests,
reflective markers were attached to key points on the bat’s chest and wings using medical adhesive. The
bats were then directed to fly along the length of an enclosed flight cage while two specialty low light
cameras captured their body and wing movements.
The recorded video showed that the motion of one wing beat is highly articulated and much more
complex then the flapping motion of the wings of birds and insects. The researchers found that the shape of
the bat’s wing, as well as its relative position, changed drastically during forward flight. This is enabled by
the fact a bat’s wing has more than two dozen independently controlled joints which allows it to stretch and
deform. During flight the wing experienced periods of both positive and negative angle of attack (angle
between the incoming flow and the chord of the airfoil) and the camber of the wing changed dramatically,
resulting in complex 3-D surfaces. In comparison, the shape and angle of attack of the fixed wing of an
airplane in steady forward flight remains constant and can be easily modeled as a 2D structure.
However, characterizing the kinematics of flight is not enough to describe the aerodynamic control
achieved by bats. How the flow interacts with the complex 3D shape of the wing and resulting aerodynamic
forces must be evaluated. To better understand this, the researchers took PIV measurements of the wake
behind the bat as it flew. This technique was performed on the wake of a bat by lightly misting the air with
DEHS (di-ethyl-hexyl-sebacate) particles. This mist is non-toxic and had no apparent effect on bat
behavior. They then placed a laser beam-break sensor in the flight path of the bat. After the sensor was
tripped and a set lag time passed, a low power laser sheet illuminated the flow volume directly behind the
bat. Through the collected PIV data the researchers identified a complex wake vortex structure.
