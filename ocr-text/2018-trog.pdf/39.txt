The going is pleasant, the crawlways you find
Are nothing compared to the ones left behind.
Reluctantly pass up the side avenues;
The passage ahead is the one you should choose.
Gypsum is seen on the walls now and then,
There's more here than any place else that you've been.
You're crawling; abruptly the rock starts to tilt
And you ease your way over the clay and the silt.
You hear it ahead now - a waterfall's roar!
To the sights you've examined get set to add more.
The room's entered high on a mud-covered slope -
Not to steep to climb down it safely, you hope.
The thundering boom is impressive all right,
And so is the scene that's revealed by your light.
The water cascades down a multi-step drop
That's a fully twenty feet from the bottom to top.
It's late now, you're tired - Safety First is the rule-
You'd better not chance the slick climb past the pool.
With longing you peer past the falls through the gloom-
The next trip you'll go past the "Waterfall Room‚Äù.
Tell you to quit - you can't take any more.
So back through the walkways, the crawls, and the slime;
There's more cave, but you'll have to see it next time.
Go out past the "Y", past the canyon, past all
Of the walkway, the stoop-way, the duckwalk and crawl.
The "Hall" is behind you, "The Big Push" ahead.
Better rest first; relax on your stone featherbed.
