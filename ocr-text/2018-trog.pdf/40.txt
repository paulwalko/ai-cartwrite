Up now, by golly. And summon your strength.
You'll need it - remember the height and the length
Of the knee-crushing, back-breaking crawlway you face;
It's abundance of mud and its big lack of space.
Again you crawl on 'til you're ready to drop.
How far is the entrance - does the cave never stop?
At last stars are seen out ahead of your light.
And groaning, you stagger out into the night.
It's great. You can stand up, move freely around.
And yet it's so nice to just lie on the ground,
And tiredly discuss all the wonders you've seen;
The big stuff - so nice - the crawlways - so mean.
The cave lies behind you: Windy Mouth in her glory.
You're left with your memories - some grand, and some gory.
'Twas worth every ache, every pain, and bruised bone -
But now, with tired steps, you start back for home.
