Windy Camp
By Nick Socky and Kelly McCarthy
August 11th, 2017
Andrew Lycas, Nick Socky, and Scott Zagrodny left the WVACS field station around 9:30 am and made their
way to the parking area at Second Creek. The river level was low enough that taking the lower route around Red
Rocks worked great (especially hauling two packs per person). The team got to
Camp
off
and
the cave at 11 AM and started the
long crawl and 1.5 mile trip to
The goal was to drop bolting gear
at the turn off for L survey, get to
set up camp, and then head to the
upper levels. After 2.5 hours of lot's
of groaning, sighing, and bitching;
Andrew, Scott, and Nick arrived at
camp. Nick and Andrew went back
the waterfall room to retrieve the
stashed gear from the previous
trip and camp set up began.

Camp is positioned directly after the
short crawl way just past the waterfall room
and is at the turn off into the N Survey,
where the Mud Plug passage is. It is a very
dry cozy camp with a great flat area on a
shelf for a kitchen, 8 ft tall passage, and it
can support up to 6 people very easily.
More areas on the mud bank to the right
(looking up stream) could be dug and
flattened to allow
for more people if needed. After claiming sleeping
spots, everyone got to work with tidying up the
place in preparation for Joe Calderone and Kelly
McCarthy to arrive later that evening.
