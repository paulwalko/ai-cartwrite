The $358 for Aluminum in the final tally is considerably less than the $462 of the previous Fall.
It seems the Club was getting bored with the Contest, and some of the Frats were starting to figure
things out, so it became more effort to win. And the prizes seemed to be getting smaller. The Miller
officials announced in the Fall that the contest might be discontinued if there were not more
containers turned in than had been the previous Spring. We started the Fall Quarter of 1981 with
over $4,700 in savings, and were in second place at one of the early turn-ins. By the end of the
contest we had fallen to fifth place, but still managed to get $500 out of it.
In the Spring '82 Minutes there is one mention that we were “way behind", and nothing else, so
presumably not a win. However, in the Fall of '82 Kent Thompson took over as the Miller Chairman
and managed to inspire/browbeat us back to a first place win for another $1337. But that
enthusiasm was hard to maintain, and in the Spring of '83 we eked out only a 4" place finish.
In the Fall of '83 a motion was made to not compete in the contest, but was defeated when Ray
Hogwood volunteered to be Miller chairman. In November of '83 the treasurer's report listed
$7,361 in the savings account, but there is very little mention of Miller campaigns after that, so
probably the Spring of '83 was the last time we won anything. I have found no record of when the
Miller Campaigns were discontinued, so it may have been that the contests were discontinued after
that, or the Club just stopped competing. Either way, the Miller Campaign Era drew to a close.
Part 2 – The Miller Money
At this point the Club was like some poor folks whose rich uncle had died, leaving them a pile of
money. Many of the people who had been in the early parts of the contests had moved on, and
there were as many opinions as members about what the Club should do with the money.
To appreciate just how much money was being discussed, it is useful to look at comparison costs
and prices between then and now. For the 2017-18 term, VT lists in-state full time tuition as
$13,000 and dorm/meals an additional $8,700, for $21,900 a year.
When I was an undergraduate (late '70's), tuition and dorm/meals were ~$650/Quarter, or just
under $2,000 for a full year. That is a 5.4:1 ratio. Consider that the Grand Prize money for the Fall
'80 contest shown above would have covered an entire year of tuition, room and board. The
'inflation index' for the 30 years 1978-2018 is listed as only 3.8. But beer could be had back then
for right around $1 a six-pack for the PBR/Schmidt's/Rheingold end of things, up to nearly $2 for the
pricier options (which almost no one considered). The charge for the 1980 Banquet was $7, and $9
for 1982. So, for items of immediate importance to students, such as tuition and beer, a 5:1
difference is a nice round number to keep in mind. When you look at that $7,361 figure from
November '83, think of it as over $35,000 in today's dollars.
Of course, you had some folks who could see no further than free kegs every weekend, but they
were in the minority. Because many of the people who were now deciding what to do with the
money had not played a large role in earning it, there was an emerging consensus that the money
should be used to somehow benefit the club as a whole, and maybe over a long term. But that did
not move things very far along, as that was still a pretty nebulous goal.
One semi-popular idea was to 'invest' in a field house in either Giles or the Skydusky area, so that
survey trips could reduce commute times and spend more time in the caves. The obvious
drawbacks of this idea was that it would saddle the Club with taxes, maintenance, insurance and
other issues – quite possibly for something that would not be used by further generations. In a
dynamic organization like the Club, there is a fresh flow of new folks coming in and older ones
moving on, and preferences/projects/attitudes evolve. So the question remained, and was
debated, for some time as to a good use for the money.
