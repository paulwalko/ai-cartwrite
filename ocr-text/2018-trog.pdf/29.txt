Author Note: While I was part of, and advocated for, the original investment decision, it is obvious
that the basis of that decision is no longer valid in this time. The Club seems to be much more
adept at keeping a positive balance sheet these days, and the relative value of the money is
perhaps a fifth of what it once was, even if the actual balance remains the same.
To my thinking, the main value of that money lies in the history of its heritage, but that is not a
spendable asset. While I see no need for immediately spending the money, I also see no need to
hold on to it if a worthwhile purpose can be found. And if that purpose can have a long term benefit
for the Club, all the better.
One such purpose I could readily support is if there were another local cave conservancy project
such as New River cave â€“ that money would represent the Clubs contribution to preservation of a
local cave for all time. Another suggestion I could support is to use those funds to ensure that
equipment for new trainees is always in sufficient supply and working condition. Those are just two
suggestions, and I'm sure there are many worthy ideas.
The current generation of the Club has the reigns now, and I'm sure whatever they choose will be
fine.
