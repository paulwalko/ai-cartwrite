The unanimous Declaration of the Carbide Lamp Test
A Cave-Related Parody of the Declaration of Independence
By Matthew Kok
When in the Course of caving shenanigans and hooliganism it becomes necessary for cavers to
dissolve the opinions on lighting that have connected them with another, because we can and I need to write
a Trog article, in the interest of other NSS grottos they should declare the causes which impel them to a
different Light.
We hold these reasons to be self-evident, that not all headlamps are created equal, that some are created
with superior properties, that among these are Heat, Toxic Acetylene Gas, and the pursuit of reasonable
carbide shipping costs – That to secure these attributes, Headlamps are carried by cavers, utilizing their light
to pursue Passage, - That whenever any form of Light is realized to be inferior to the others, it is the Right of
the Club to alter or abolish it, and to institute new Light, laying its foundation on such principles and
organizing its light in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to affect their ability to cave effectively.
Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Headlamps briefly adopted should not be changed for insignificant and
petty causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that cavers are more disposed to suffer, while lights
are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a
long series of dead batteries, cracked lenses and loose wires, chasing Virgin passage reveals a list of flaws, it
is their right, it is their duty to cast off such Lights, and to switch to Carbide for their future light. - Such has
been the patient sufferance of this Club; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their
former Mechanism of Lighting. The history of the present LED Headlamp is a history of dead batteries and
nowhere to charge them, all having in direct object the establishment of an inferior Headlamp over this
club. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to an impartial university.
It has allowed the art of Carbide Caving slip into obscurity among the latest generation of cavers.
It has been removed from the Trainee Program, such that the Old Farts may argue that VPI cavers of today
are inferior to themselves.
It has subject Trainees and recent Members to the tales relevant to carbide caving, usually beginning with
“When I was a Trainee” or “Back in my day”.
It has caused much undue financial burden on destitute college students by way of $90.00 Zebra Lights and
$10.00 18650 batteries.
It has caused a shortage of carbide among online merchants, and rising shipping costs of carbide.
It has sensitive electronics which are not easily repaired in-cave or outside.
It has not the ability to graffiti cave walls to make known that you were the first through a passage.
It has required the use of ugly, flimsy elastic bands to be secured to helmets.
It has not the ability to be used in a heat tent to warm hypothermic Trainees.
It has not the ability to be passed onto posterity as gifts and heirlooms.
It has not the nostalgia nor historical significance of Carbide.
