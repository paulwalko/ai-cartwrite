Experiments with an out-of-cal DistoX2
WF Koerschner 3-25-2018
Four hours into the cave and the foresights are 2 degrees off from the
backsights. Oh Fudge! What do we do now professor? Scooping is not an
option.
In a perfect world your Cams all have factory teeth, your cave suit still has an
ass to it and your DistoX is in perfect calibration such that it reads the same
values in any orientation. But, COME ON, Folks we are dealing with cavers
here. "I should really go home and re-calibrate the Disto before tomorrow's
trip but okay, maybe just one more beer". Thus one can assume that nearly
every DistoX is in some state of less than perfect calibration. The question is
how do you get the best survey accuracy in an imperfect world?
In the years since I purchased my DistoX2 I have heard a lot of advice about
how to survey with one: You should shoot foresights and backsights!
Backsights are a waste of time â€“ just shoot double foresights! Well, in Europe,
we always shoot all 4 orientations and average them. Well, back in my day,
real men surveyed with Bruntons! (Wait! That was me!) Tired of the BLA BLA
BLA; I decided to do some experiments to prove it for myself.
First I needed an out-of-calibration DistoX. Well, what do you know, I just
happened to have one! You see, on the most recent survey trip to Lowmoor
Cave we discovered that the backsights were 2 degrees off from the foresights
and proceeded to survey anyway. Who cares - not my project (Sorry, Dave
Socky. Will reshoot if you like).
Method: I laid out a 9 shot survey course in the woods; 446 ft long,
horizontal extent of 425 ft, vertical extent of 20 ft. First I very carefully
surveyed the course with Suunto & tape shooting both foresights and
backsights; this "Analog" loop closes with a horizontal error of 0.2 ft and a
vertical error of 0.7 ft. The East, North, Up (ENU) of this loop is 0.2, 0.1, 0.7.
Next I surveyed the course with my out-of-calibration DistoX2 shooting
foresights and backsights in all 4 orientations (Display Up, Display Down,
Display Right, Display Left).
