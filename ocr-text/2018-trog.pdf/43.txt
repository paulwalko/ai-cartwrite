Recipe and Guide by Kyle Nenninger
This is an uncooked, lightly smoked, fermented sausage traditionally from Germany that takes about a
month to make. Apart from light and oxygen turning the fat rancid, this is entirely shelf-stable, and as long
as it's caught early most mold can be cleaned off with a clean rag and diluted vinegar, or at worst cut away.
If you have a cellar they can hang indefinitely. That said, they will pick up smells from the refrigerator, and
apart from stress-testing I keep mine tightly wrapped in the freezer.
As this is an uncooked sausage, and one made with game, I would strongly advise following best practices
and freezing the venison for at least a week to kill potential parasites. That said, the roundworm that
causes trichinosis is resistant to freezing, and nothing in this process handles the hazard it presents. You
have been warned.
My minimum batch for this type of project is ~8lb as it gives me a decent feeling of return on the time
investment, but this recipe will scale down to 21b as long as you are careful to evenly mix in the curing salt.
For casings I typically use hog, but for this application they are a little large. Sheep casings make good snack
sticks.
Ingredients:
5t. sugar
6.25lb venison, cleaned and ground
1.75lb pork fat, belly or jowl, skin removed and ground
Casings, 16-20ft hog or 36-48ft sheep, soaked, inspected,
and rinsed
Starter culture *while bacteria cultures can be ordered
online I personally just pureed and mixed in 1/4c kimchi*
1c red wine
1/2 head of garlic
80g or 1/4c salt
1/2c fennel bulb, chopped
8g or 1.5t Insta Cure #2
1/4c sage - fresh, or substitute 1.5T dried
Directions:
I personally grind my own meat and add the last group of ingredients during the second pass, but it's fine if
you don't - just be sure to very finely chop the first 3 and grind the second 3 ingredients.
Always work with very cold, but not quite frozen, meat and equipment to avoid smearing the fat. Mix the
salts and the sugar together to ensure even distribution, and work it, as well as your choice of starter
culture, into the meat 12-24hr before stuffing.
Add the wine ~2hr before stuffing, or give it at least as much time as it takes to absorb. Personally, I find it
takes about as long as preparing the casings and setting up my equipment.
When stuffing it is extremely important for this sausage in particular to avoid air bubbles, as we are relying
in part on anaerobic conditions to prevent nasty things from growing inside. If you do get an air bubble,
wait until after stuffing then sterilize a needle with a lighter to prick it and work the air out.
