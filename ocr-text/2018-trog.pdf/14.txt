BANQUET
75TH ANNIVERSARY!
SIASA
OS
This year was the 75th anniversary banquet for the cave club!
We had a record turn-out of over 200 people, including many that we haven't seen in a long time!
The Hyatt was a great venue and the dancing went on way past everyone's bedtimes. Richard Cobb
put on a great slideshow for the banquet, awards were distributed, and Bob Alerson and Bill Douty
delivered an excellent program on the history of Clover Hollow! Big thanks to everyone who came,
spoke, and helped bring banquet together. Extra big thanks to Aaron Thomas for herding us eats
cavers.
Philip Balister and Sandy Knapp won the A.1 Cartwright award and A.I Cartwright even delivered it
to them himself. They later climbed on a table and danced to “Teenage Wasteland” and celebrated
with their adoring fans. Other awards were given, such as Never-an-Armchair-Caver awarded to Bill
Koerschner, Flameout awarded to Andrew Schoenewolf, Firefighter awarded to Jason Delafield,
Brain-Bucket to Reilly Blackwell, Good Driver awarded to Will 'Skippy-the-Wonder-Pig' Borin, and
the prestigious Bad-Ass Trainee awarded to Rowan Berman.
