For producing an inferior product overseas, thus taking away jobs and capital from this Nation. For dividing this club between Old Farts and Everyone Else. For limiting cavers to a handful of preset light intensities. It has excited insurrections against us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of the pits, the savage CHUDS whose known diet, is an undistinguished array of all ages, sexes, and abilities. In every stage of these Misfortunes We have Heckled for redress at meetings and over Listserv: Our Heckling has been answered only by repeated mockery and disregard. A Lamp, whose character and usefulness is less than that of cotton in a wet cave, is unfit to be the Light of VPI cavers. Nor have We been wanting in failures to our LED devices. We have heckled time and time again of their menial nature and for the return of the Carbide Lamp Test. We have discussed in meeting the return of the Carbide Lamp Test. We have replaced battery after battery and charged them night after night. We have prayed to our cave overlords for the return of the Test, and we have made offerings to them in the form of crappy Easter Beer, stale GORP, and Library Books. They too, have been unresponsive to the voice of reason and progress. We must therefore, return to the ways of Carbide, and train with them as we do all other skills, in the form of the Carbide Lamp Test. We, therefore, the Representatives of the VPI Cave Club, in no particular manner of seriousness, are appealing to the Mostly-Adequate Leaders of the club for the rectitude of our training program, do, in the name of some important person, and by the Authority of the Old Farts of this club, solemnly publish and declare, That this united Club is, and of Right ought to reinstate the Carbide Lamp Test, that it will return to using Carbide Lamps, and that all LED Headlamps between members and the Club Gear, are and ought to be totally rejected; and that as a Carbide-using Club, it has full Power to graffiti walls, dump spent carbide wherever it pleases, cave with dubious hardware and technique, and to do all other Acts and Things which Old Farts may have done “Back in their day”. – And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the divine Approval of Old Farts, we mutually pledge to each other to restore the Carbide Lamp Test to our trainee program.
TL;DR: Bring back the carbide lamp test.
