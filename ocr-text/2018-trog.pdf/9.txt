Welcome to the VPI Cave Club!
The VPI Cave Club is a student grotto of the National Speleological Society. Our goal is to promote interest in
and to advance the science of speleology, to promote conservation of caves and safety in their exploration,
and to encourage fellowship among Virginia Tech students and alumni interested in caving.
That's the description on our website. What our site doesn't say is that we're also a community of the most
colorful, adventurous, quirky, awesome people you could ever find! Our site says we're cavers, but we're also
students, teachers, doctors, scientists, athletes, cooks, musicians, parents, veterans, men, women, young and
old-fart, engineers, rescuers, writers, artists, and the list goes on. Caving is what brings us together but the
community is what makes you never want to leave (and many of us literally never leave.)
So if you've never caved with us, ask a member to get on a trip. You'll learn a lot, see a lot, and you might
even get some life-long friendships out of it.
I want to give a big thank you to everyone who makes the cave club possible. Our club wouldn't be what it is
without all of our generous members, landowners, and friends who sacrifice their time and energy for the
club. They share their property and homes with us, they lead trainee trips, they organize and host events, ed-
ucate the young-ins, donate resources and gear, and generally make an inclusive environment that really
feels like a family.
