After surveying a few 40 ft shots, everyone stopped for a lunch break, where it was noticed how much the
air was still moving. It was cold up there! The survey of the upper levels ended in 30 ft tall, 10 ft wide
canyon with amazing helectite bushes on the left wall. The passage does continue fairly tall but breaks into a
complex multi intersection with passage going forward, left, right, and up. To the left, the ceiling drops to
about 5 ft tall and has flowing water. To the right, is a breakdown mess of a room with water also coming
from along the right wall. The forward and upward passage looks as if it connects to both the left and right
passage in maybe 20 to 30 ft and it might also intersect another upper level passage.
On the way out, a few pictures were taken of the fantastic helectites and formation as well as the
large canyon passage. A real photo trip will need to be done to the upper levels of the cave to really capture
how impressive this passage is. It took about 50 minutes to return to camp where a resounding
“BABE!” was heard as everyone
approached. Kelly and Joe had been
in the N survey up in the mud plug
section of the cave.
They had entered the cave
around 5:30 pm on Friday August 11
after an exceptionally humid (even
for Richmonders) hike along the
river. 30 seconds after
Kelly breached the drip line the skies opened up...this was taken as a good omen and after a minute of
quiet contemplation it was decided to head into camp. An uneventful hike along the usual thoroughfare
and the destination was reached; there was a definite upswing in sighs after picking up Joe's second pack
before first canyon (the timing a coincidence for sure). Some quick work setting up sleeping bags and all
were ready to go. With a description of "N" as a mud plug survey, expectations were low; a good lesson in
not making assumptions as the next 15 min involved caving through beautifully decorated passage. The
"NB" survey began just past the formations with a passage full of breakdown blocks and a small stream
meandering back and forth across and out of the passage. A small room/loop containing a pool full of scum
and the passage settles down into a small old stream bed lined with cobbles. After 2.5 hours (probably, no
one remembered a watch and thus were relying on Joe's impressive sense of time) 315 feet of passage had
been surveyed with Joe sketching and Kelly on point and DistoX. The passage continued onward but food
and sleep were calling so they ventured back to camp.
With a nearly full camp of 5 cavers, everyone was cracking jokes, telling stories, prepared food and
hot drinks, and was merry over the fact that they were camping in a cave. Nick went and set a few bolts in
camp for a clothes line and a way to hang a lantern. A lone bat also decided to join in the fun and fly back
and forth a few times. Everyone got ready for bed, excited about the next day.
