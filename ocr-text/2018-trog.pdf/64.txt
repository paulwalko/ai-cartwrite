Lesson #3: There are some things a rescue nerd can
do that most cavers can't (or wouldn't think of). See
Photo 4 for the â€œFlower" directional. This technique
provides high redirection of a rope purely by attaching a
pulley directly or by tether to your D-link and using brute
strength of your arms and legs along with the rescue haul
system to help get the patient/litter over an edge.
Firefighter Fluornnoy (nicknamed Flower) used this
exceedingly successfully and safely in multiple caves. I've
tried this technique and seen other cavers do it, but not to
the same level that Flower accomplished. He was an
adequate above and below-ground rigger, but the
simplicity of this technique when other high help
opportunities were limited was something thrilling to
behold. Also exciting was watching his finely chiseled
calves and biceps flexing against the weight of the patient
and the litter. I got to experience being tied up between
Flower's thighs when he did this and have only
compliments about the event. I think I made him blush.
Cavers need rescue nerds.

Lesson #4: Pocket bacon is the best cave
snack. There is something inexplicably tasty
about bacon that has been marinating in your
pocket all day while you're underground (see
Photo 5). Maybe it is the tenderizing that
happens to it when you're navigating The Nasty.
Maybe it is the extra seasoning that sneaks into
the bag. Maybe it is just the grease. Regardless,
pocket bacon is the way to go. If you want to go
more advanced, try the Bagel Bacon Cream
Cheese (courtesy B.Ekey) or the Eggs a la
Rappel (J.McGuire and R.Blackwell). However, I
do not recommend Cave Quiche.
