In the Fall of 1984 I became Chairman of the Inactive Funds Committee to look into options for long
term strategy. Kay Jacobsen was Treasurer at the time and also on the Committee.

Kay summarized the Club treasury activity for the calendar year, 1984, shown above. (The $68 entry
for Miller aluminum indicates there must have still been some low level contest activity during that
year)
At the time Kay produced the statement, the money was in a standard interest bearing savings
account, and even at that lower rate the Club received $672 in interest. All dues for the same period
totaled $1105, so the interest provided over a third of the income for that year, and we still ended up
in negative cash flow (although that could be explained by the Club Store â€“ the net 'loss' of $726 to
the store could have been offset by a similar increase in the inventory in the store). But the main
take away was that the interest from the Miller Money had become a significant part of the Club
finances.
The proposal that emerged from discussions was to consider the Miller Money as an income
producing endowment. The capital would be invested, and the dividends used as part of the Club's
annual operating expenses. This would provide a long term benefit to the Club in that student dues
