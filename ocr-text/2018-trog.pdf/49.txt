Aragonite Crystal: How to grow the mineral
Select your favorite rock or rocks to grow crystals on. The aragonite will not grow all the way around
the entire stone, but rather grow on one of the surfaces. Keep this in mind when choosing your base
stone.
Wash and dry your rocks. Place one or more into
your container.
Pour your vinegar into the container so that it
partially covers the stone, but leaves the uppermost
face or point exposed. This is where the crystal will
form.
Partially cover the container. Over the next 5 to 14
days, your calcium carbonate will form as the
vinegar evaporates. You shouldn't completely seal
your container or the vinegar won't evaporate.
You can remove the crystal when you are happy with
the size or continue to add more vinegar to make
the crystal larger. You can also add dolomite powder
to the top of the stone or to the solution to provide
more calcium carbonate. Remove your stone from
the container and allow to air dry.

Other tips for Aragonite
• You can experiment with using calcium carbonate crystal as a seed to deposit more crystal onto and
dolomite powder as a calcium carbonate source.
Using dolomite powder allows you to skip using the dolomite stone. Instead of the stone, aragonite can
be deposited onto other non-smooth objects in the container.
•
Other minerals and colors can be added to the solution to change the color and appearance of the
crystal.
Spray your minerals with a sealant to preserve them from dust and moisture that may damage them.
