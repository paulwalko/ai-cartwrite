The following proposal for division of funds was made on March 29, 1985: The motion was voted on
and passed April 12, 1985. And that is the
basis of how we got to where we are today.

This plan seemed to work well, at least in the
beginning. I found this statement for a one
year period in 1987-88. While it is not clear
from this why the interest received was higher
than expected in the proposal, it is clear that
the Club received more in interest for that
period than it received in dues. So the
investment was apparently working well as an
endowment.

However, nothing stays the same, and change
happens. My own involvement in the matter of
the Miller Money ended at this point, as I had
moved away from the area. But in researching
this article I discovered that the Club undertook

Beth M. Wichterman, Treasurer only guess that the decision was made to
reinvest the interest into growing the
investment
If that is so, then the money lost its original purpose as an endowment, and became an investment
for its own sake. And the purpose of that investment, if it was ever known, appears to be lost to
present knowledge.
Interest rates today are extremely low (which is somewhat balanced by inflation being much lower
as well, at least for now...), so returning the money to the original purpose of the endowment makes
little sense, as the income produced would be minuscule. Hopefully this article will provide a good
starting point if/when the Club takes a whole new look at the Miller Money.
