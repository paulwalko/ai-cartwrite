When You Can't Take the Cave Home with You
A Guide to Artificially Growing Calcium Carbonate Crystals
By Kellen Levinson
Do you ever wish you could have a piece of cave on your shelf? Have you ever found a broken chunk of
calcite in a cave and longed to take it home like the pack rat you are? As cavers know, well taking
formations from a cave not only deprives other visitors from enjoying the naturally formed rocks and
minerals, but harms the cave and carries a hefty fine for those who swipe cave stones. But fear not, fellow
caver! There is hope for people like us who are obsessed with sparkly things and wish to have a pretty,
white chunk of calcium carbonate to look at when reminiscing of the hours spent crawling around in the
crust of the earth.
The good news is that you can grow calcium carbonate and other crystals in the comfort of your own home.
You don't even have to put on a cave suit to do it!
Aragonite Crystals: How does it work?
Most of the caves in our area are solutional karst caves and form through limestone. Limestone contains a
mix of minerals, chiefly calcite and aragonite. The water that forms these caves is saturated with carbon
dioxide from the air and soil. When it contacts limestone, calcium carbonate dissolves from the rock into
the water and reacts with carbon dioxide to form a calcium bicarbonate molecule. When this solution is
exposed to air, the chemical reaction is reversed and calcium carbonate is deposited onto whatever surface
the solution touches. This is how flowstone, soda straws, cave bacon, and other calcite formations are
born.
This home experiment uses dolomite and acid in the form of vinegar to create a similar solution. Dolomite
is a common stone and a naturally occurring source of calcium carbonate. When combined with the acidic
vinegar, the calcium carbonate from the dolomite will dissolve and saturate the acid. As the vinegar
evaporates it will deposit the calcium carbonate back onto the surface of the dolomite stone in the form of
aragonite crystal, a pretty white mineral you can keep on your bookshelf not unlike the formations under-
ground.
