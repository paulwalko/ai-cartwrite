Cavers take safety very seriously, and helmet pizza deserves a thorough safety evaluation. The user manual
for the Edelrid Ultralight helmet contains the following:
GENERAL INFORMATION ON SAFETY, PRODUCT LIFE, STORAGE, CARE AND IDENTIFICATION
Safety notices
If original components are modified or removed from the product, its safety aspects may be
restricted. The equipment should not be modified in any way or altered to allow attachment of
additional parts without the manufacturer's written recommendation.
Since the installation of pizza into the helmet would be considered a modification, it seemed prudent to
seek a written recommendation from the manufacturer. The following message was sent to Edelrid:
Good day. I have a question about the Ultralight helmet, which I use for caving.
The user manual states that "If original components are modified or removed from the product, its
safety aspects may be restricted. The equipment should not be modified in any way or altered to
allow attachment of additional parts without the manufacturer's written recommendation."
The styrofoam insert in the top of the helmet has come unglued. Rather than glue the foam back
into place, I'm curious if it can be removed, and the vacated space in the top of the helmet then used
to carry some supplies? Ideally, I would like to carry some food rations here, such as a mini pizza.
Conveniently, the pizza would be kept warm by escaping body heat.
The RED BARON Singles Pepperoni Deep Dish Pizza (https://www.redbaron.com/products/single-
deep-dish/single-deep-dish-pepperoni.htm) appears to be a good fit for this helmet. While I do not
have any quantitative information on the mechanical properties of this cooked pizza, I can
qualitatively say that it is quite delicious.
Could you please give me your written recommendation for this proposed modification?
Unfortunately, the manufacturer has not responded in a timely enough manner for the publication of this
article. Surely, a team of German engineers has been in round-the-clock meetings in order to determine an
appropriate recommendation. Stay tuned for updates, including real-cave testing data.
