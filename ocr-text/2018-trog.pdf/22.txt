The
Miller Campaigns
Richard Cobb - VPI 215
Few topics in Cave Club lore have reached the legendary status of the Miller Campaigns. The
“Miller Money” has been an object of reverence, derision, and debate for lo these many years.
This is an attempt to summarize some main points for those age-challenged youth who did not
have the privilege of living the events (and for those age-challenged Old Farts who lived them, but
can't remember them). What follows comes from hours of reviewing meeting minutes, Trogs, and
the author's fuzzy memory.
Part 1 - From Rags to Riches
Before the start of the Miller Campaigns in 1975, the Cave Club was just another poverty stricken
student organization. The treasury often had a couple of hundred dollars in it, although it ranged
from less than $10 to over $500 (just before the bills for Banquet were paid).
The first mention of the Miller Contest was in the Spring Quarter of 1975, although there are not
many details in the records. It appears the first Contest Chairman was Ed Loud (yes, that Ed
Loud of ELMT fame) – presumably because of special expertise related to beer. There are no de-
tails of that first contest, other than a Dewey vs Truman gaffe on the part of the Collegiate Times –
who reported a Frat as having won the contest, instead of the Cave Club (who actually won it). It
seems first prize was a fancy stereo, which was sold to Bill Douty for $800 (about $3-4,000 in to-
day's dollars - see explanation in Part 2).
After that first win, the Miller Contests became a key Cave Club activity every Spring and Fall
(although, from the Trip Reports in the Minutes from these times, it appears that caving did not
suffer because of it). It was thought that the Frats accumulated
containers for the contest by starting with full ones and drinking
the contents. While the Cave Club also contributed in that
manner, the real accumulations came from walking roadsides
and Dumpster Diving. The rural refuse-collecting dumpsters
were not fenced and attended as they are today, and many
hours were spent inside dumpsters ripping open bags and
extracting cans and bottles (often requiring heroic commitment
to overcome particularly adverse conditions).
The goal was to collect cans and bottles (not necessarily beer,
but most were). Cans had to be aluminum, and magnets were
used at the check-in stations to quickly locate and remove any
steel cans that had been included. Clear and green bottles
were accepted, but not brown. Large clear plastic bags with
the Miller Logo were provided for pickup, which found their way to other uses as well (such as a
Halloween costume).
