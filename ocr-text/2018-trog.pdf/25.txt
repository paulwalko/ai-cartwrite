Jerry Redder announced a new contest at a meeting in the Spring of 1980, which the Club won in
the 'Open Division'. Few stats are listed, other than we turned in 564 lbs of aluminum cans – which
is somewhere around 15,000 cans. Although the 'Open' division was for smaller clubs, we still beat
the bigger ones in total points. So for Fall of '80 we were moved to the (supposedly) more
challenging 'Frat Division', and won again anyway. There was an article about that in the Jan '81
issue of the Collegiate Times
