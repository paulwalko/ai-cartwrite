Phillip, Reilly, and I arrived in Cookeville around 7 PM. We had aspirations of going into the cave that night to set up camp, but
better judgment prevailed and we drank beer instead. We leafed through the map with Clinton and got a better idea of what areas we
were going to focus on - Baghdad Breakdown and Mega Canyon were identified as promising regions to push leads and find new
cave.

We distributed gear and packed in the morning. A quick stop was made at Bojangles for our breakfasts and Clinton's camp food. The
three of us from Virginia took notes. We changed as quickly as was possible at the cave, and hiked to the entrance in search of
warmth. The trip started at 11 AM, and we made good time to our camp location (~3 hours) near the third river crossing. We
unpacked and set up camp, before heading out to the Baghdad Breakdown area around 3 PM. We also discovered that sand and
kneepads had already begun to do some damage to the skin on Phillip and Reilly's knees. Ouch. Somehow it did not slow them down
much for the duration of the trip. The main item of interest was a bolt climb to good passage marked on the map in the NAH
survey. We located the climb fairly quickly - I free climbed to the top of it while looking at the ceiling for the bolting lead. Clinton
and I surveyed down it back to the tie-in while Reilly and Phillip bolt-climbed a promising phreatic feature seen earlier in the
passage. It didn't go. Clinton and I poked around the NAH survey for an hour or so without finding any remaining leads. It seems
safe to cross the area off the list for future efforts. The survey of the climb netted 113.3 feet in 5 stations (no designation), with a
tie-in at NAH 24.
We made it back to camp around midnight.

We got up and slowly organized before heading out towards Mega Canyon. Some stream leads were identified as promising –
“they’re wet, so they probably weren't surveyed' was Clinton's operating theory. We made good time out to Mega Canyon, and
spent some time lighting the ceiling up to look for high leads. None were spotted. The three Virginians took an hour or so to bounce
Crashing Spire Plunge (150 ft, and reputably the most remote big pit in TAG) – I reasoned that we definitely wouldn't be interested
again if we managed to find water or mud later in the day. While we did that, Clinton found a way to crawl up and around to a
ceiling feature near the turn-off for the pit. It did nothing interesting.
After our pit-bouncing detour, Reilly and I checked out the cross-cutting stream passage at NE9. Reilly found some water and mud
pushing downstream to find that it sumped within 40 feet. I stayed on the bank and sketched it in. We put a few shots into it to make
a tie-in, which totaled 92.3 ft – most of which was tie-in shots in Mega Canyon. We then pushed upstream to look for leads, and
found none. One branch of the passage may still go – I do not recall the survey designation but Clinton recalled the survey team
wanting to name it ‘The Cat Turd.' It's all yours.
Phillip and Clinton split off to look at pit and dome leads marked near the NU survey. Many of those leads remain unchecked,
because the 1st one they checked went into new cave immediately. Clinton went through the tight crawl that begins the NU survey
first. He found a promising dome (~NUA 3) and an upclimb at NUA5 that he proceeded to climb. The trip almost made a turn for the
worst at the top of the climb, where a huge slab (my guess puts it at ~500 lbs) dislodged and slid into place over the hole he had just
climbed out of. Fortunately, Clinton is a lot stronger than any of us, and was able to shift the rock enough to escape. We resolved to
name the passage he found ‘Elmore's Escape.'
Survey notes reported a 'dome-pit into blackness' at NU7 – a second look by fresh cavers found it to be a 7-foot downclimb into a
decent sized room. Phillip Moneyhun pushed the breakdown at the end of the room, and popped out into a large breakdown chamber
with multiple bolt climbing leads. Phillip and Clinton then returned to Mega Canyon to tell Reilly and me that we could stop pushing
wet stuff and start surveying the new discovery.
We returned to the room pretty late in the day, and only had enough time to complete minor objectives. Phillip and Clinton started
(and finished) a 20-ft bolt climb to see if the apparent canyon leaving the breakdown chamber could be followed. Reilly and I headed
back out of the new area to survey Elmore's Escape (extension of the NUA survey). We mapped 93.2 feet through mostly nice
passage, minus the trapdoor rock. It ended in a very drippy breakdown pile. Reilly pushed into it for a few body lengths, and found
that the passage turns almost 180 degrees and trends back the way it came. This suggests that it might intersect the dome near NUA
3. The breakdown was still shifting 5 minutes after Reilly left it – the dome is probably the safer lead to push for more discoveries in
this area.
