LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT
VPI Cave Club,
This year has been incredible. We celebrated our 75th anniversary, had a Heck of a Banquet,
voted in 12 new members (464-475) and have many more nearly there, added several local caves
to our repertoire, opened up our TAG cave access, restarted Spring Break TAG trips, have greater
vertical proficiency than I've ever seen and more active projects than I can count! Our caving is so
diverse now that several of the newest members have only repeated a cave once, yet have over
100 hours underground. I can remember "back in my day" the repetitive Pig Hole/Links/Tawneys/
New River trips, with an occasional treat of Clover Hollow or rarer still, Murder Hole. We're caving
harder, and more often, than I've ever seen. I'm proud of us all for making it happen, I'm excited for
the club to keep up the trajectory, and I'm looking forward to seeing more of these caves myself.
Regrettably I wasn't able to accomplish all my goals during my term, but I am looking forward to
working with the new executives. Here's to another 75 years!
Sincerely, Phillip Moneyhun
