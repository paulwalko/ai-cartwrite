Caving is Dangerous. Don't Go.

That is the beginning of the end...
It all started at 10 am in the Smyth parking lot. That is the day everyone's life would change, but no
one knew the extent of it. Just some girl who fell in love with caving.
Starnes'. First 3.5 hours underground. We saw both waterfalls, went up the sketchy ladder (which I
later discovered that experienced cavers do not even climb because it is so sketchy), and had a
mud fight while going down the mud slide.
Links. Links again. Three weeks apart and added four more hours in total.
3.5 hours: Now, October 28, 2017 that's the day. My sister visited, who is somewhat
claustrophobic. Tried to do an activity for me, which ended with her falling in that cave. Yeah, I was
not the favorite sister for some time (even though I am the only sister), but don't worry, I bribed her
with Benny's pizza.
6.5 hours: I felt really bad about that one, but that couldn't stop me from going on more trips.
Tawney's. Then Tawney's again within the same week. I learned cave rescue in this cave and had
the pleasure to experience Grim Tawney's. Both completely opposite experiences but had a blast
both times and I could not stop smiling the entire time.
5.5 hours: Smokehole. Snow. Mud. Water. Exploring. Mud slide.
6 hours: Giant. Pig Hole. Vertical caving! Finally. That is all I'm saying. It's a blast and I love seeing
bats and the members telling us to “Go explore, kiddos”.
9.5 hours: Windy Mouth. First survey trip was so different from sport caving, but it was a blast. The
only scary part was the traverse to get to the cave. I loved the cave itself and how can you not love
it with a passage called Peanut Butter Junction!
6 hours: Pig Hole. Rain... a lot of rain. An attempt at my rigging test, but hey it was a good learning
experience. More vertical caving and a lot of learning.
