Eggcited About Cave Snacks
Author: Skylar Hopkins, VPI #463
On the topic of cave snacks, I append recipes for the official cave snack of the March 2018 TAG trip: The
Eggcellent Sandwich. When you need to frog 230ft, there is simply no better snack to help you get yolked.
To the great sadness of all, KDaniel could not attend the March 2018 TAG trip. Yet despite his absence, he
was our TAG hero, for he sent us a wondrous and confusing contraption: an electric egg cooker. Contained
within the device was a very sweet note from KDaniel, which implored us to think fondly of him, and which
contained absolutely no instructions on how to use the egg cooker. Fortunately, we avoided a potentially
eggsplosive situation by calling KDaniel early Saturday morning before attempting to cook our eggs. He
warned us that the egg cooker must be fully heated before adding the eggs, or else the eggs would run out
of the cracks in the device. Challenge Eggcepted.
Armed with this knowledge and the egg cooker, we cooked eggs at the baconning of each day to place
within our tinfoil wrapped sandwiches. Thankfully, all of our eggs turned into perfect egg patties through-
out the trip. However, one egg ended up in the BnB sink with the copious sink noodles (JMcGuire needs a
strainer), so we have yet to perfect the Neversink Sandwich.
Note: if you try to bring raw eggs to the top of the Valhalla road, you might accidentally break one into
RBlackwell's helmet. The author of this article is not responsible for any such happenings, nor did she
attempt to fry eggs on a bobbin while rappelling.
Below are our recipes, which improved through trial and error.
Recipe 1: The Distress Bacon
Suggested pairing: Kennamer Cave
Ingredients: One English muffin (toasted/burnt), one egg, one
slice of bacon, one slice of Munster cheese
Verdict: A bit dry, but it was flat enough to fit in a helmet, and it
was bacon us so happy after the slightly eggshausting entrance
crawl in Kennamer.
Recipe 2: The Original Eggcellent Sandwich
Suggested pairing: Valhalla
Ingredients: One plain bagel (toasted), two eggs, one slice of
bacon, one slice of Munster cheese
Verdict: It might sound cheesy, but this was eggsactly what we
needed for a long, rainy trip to Valhalla. (See photo of ASchoe-
newolf consuming his sandwich at the bottom of the pit.)
