LETTER FROM THE EDITOR
Dearest VPI Cave Club,
Firstly, I want to thank everyone who sent in the articles and other materials that went into
the making of this year's Tech Troglodyte. As it turns out, you will read the journal more
thoroughly than you ever have if you find yourself as the editor. The club has shared short
stories, recipes, histories, art, poetry, cave logs and much more for us all to enjoy. It's been a
pleasure reading and editing every single one. The club is an incredibly special community
and few things exhibit that more than our written tales. So with that, I hope you enjoy this
edition of the Troglodyte. And as always, happy caving!
Respectfully submitted,
Kellen Levinson
