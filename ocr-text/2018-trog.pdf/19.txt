climb. About 150' feet up the pit began to
overcome me once again. I stopped and
looked, almost crying again but couldn't
because I purposely hadn't paced myself well
and was tired. I got myself together and
continued climbing, less emotional this time
because it's hard to climb and cry at the same
time (at least for me). After I got back up, got
some food and a dry shirt, I watched Andrew
go down. I once again thought I was fine until
Andrew was close enough to the top of the pit
where I could see flashes of his light as he
climbed. I still didn't understand why this pit
was like this but I just felt so amazing even
seeing flashes of the top. After everybody had gotten back up, I volunteered to help de-rig since I had
climbed and loved the pit so much.
Later in the week I tested my theory of maybe it was just the big size of the pit when we dropped
Fantastic Pit in Ellison's. This was not the case at all, I simply had the thought of "this is cool‚Äù, rather than a
wave of emotion. The trip was amazing any way you look at it, and I am very thankful for Reilly and the
other members who took me through the caves, and helped to solidify my love for vertical caving.
*As a side note, that was the first time I had cried in a long time so the pit was something pretty special.
