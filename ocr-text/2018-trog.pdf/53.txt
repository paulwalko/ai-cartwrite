Blue Spring Cave Trip Report
Tommy Cleckner
Participants: Clinton Elmore, Phillip Moneyhun, Reilly Blackwell, Tommy Cleckner
Objective: Climb, crawl, or generally suffer our way into new passage
Preface:
This report was originally written to accompany my survey
notes and to an audience already very familiar with Blue
Spring Cave. For those unfamiliar, Blue Spring Cave is a 40-
mile long cave in White County, TN. It is the longest in the
state. BSC has a lot going for it, but it is known first and fore-
most for its seemingly endless borehole. You get underneath
the plateau, get into a dry 30'x15' tube, and just walk for a
few hours while ogling the gypsum coating everything.
Sometimes it gets bigger than 30’x15”. Luxury caving, really.
It's been on my personal list of caves to visit for a few years,
but I didn't make an attempt to go until 2017. Reilly and I, but
mostly Reilly, made nice with certified TAG cavers Clinton
Elmore and Lee White during trips over the summer and at
the TAG Fall Cave-In. We started discussing the possibility of
doing a long camp trip into BSC with Lee in October/November, he had some bolting projects in there that he had been putting
off, and was excited to get a team in there. It didn't take too much convincing to get Clinton on board. Lee dropped out in mid-
December due to scheduling issues, but we had the gear and manpower to do the trip anyway. The very short story is that between
Christmas and New Year's, we set up a very cozy camp 3 hours (and something like 4 miles) from the entrance and spent a few
days pushing leads further in, with some success. The primary discoveries were made off a section of the cave known as Mega
Canyon – a 150' tall and 30' wide passage that goes for hundreds of feet and ends seemingly far too soon. It is roughly 5 hours
travel from the entrance, one way. Despite our efforts, it still ends far too soon. We did map some cool stuff though.
Summary
Everyone likes a TL;DR. To summarize the primary discovery: the large breakdown room in which we did most of our climbing is
~50' x 40', with a 20' ceiling. There are 3 domes in the room – 2 40-footers (NU20, 21) and a 60-footer (NU18). The 60-footer
was climbed by Phillip and Reilly on our last day there, and the 40-footers remain. The passage at the top of the 60-footer sounded
unappealing, but it goes and is in need of survey. All three appear to break through the same ceiling layer and the tops are on
roughly the same vertical level. A series of dome-pits leaves the room, trending roughly north. This is where we found the 80-ft
domes and pits. There is potential for a bolt-climb at NU41, where the survey ended. The passage pinches off at the bottom, but
the passage is large immediately before and may continue at a mid-level (but it is not apparent from the bottom). No airflow was
noticeable. Potential bolt climbs also remain at NU9 and NUA3 – both look like 60 foot domes with similar character to the ones
we climbed. We decided to name the new room “the Hall of Northern Aggression.'
Additional survey was done in other areas. A bolting lead was marked on the map at NAH24 – it was free-climbed, surveyed, and
does not go. The NAH survey was looked at pretty hard – no other leads were found. Clinton found a climb at NUA5 – it was
surveyed to NUA11. The survey ended in drippy and unstable breakdown. There may be passage beyond, but it is not recommened
due to the nature of the breakdown. Luckily, the cave appears to take almost a complete 180 degree turn at the breakdown, and the
continuing passage that Reilly could see seems to be trending towards the 60-ft dome at NUA3. Any passage that could be found
past the breakdown may be reachable through a bolt climb. The stream passage up and downstream from NE9 was looked at as
well. It sumps downstream almost immediately (survey data was taken) and splits into several infeeders soon upstream.
No leads were found in one of the major branches (I believe it was the one that trends west, do not remember the survey
designation) and the other was not looked at (trends north). The trip totaled 100 hours, with 880 feet of total survey. We had a
good time doing it – thanks to Clinton for showing us around and thanks to Lonnie for providing access to such an awesome cave!
