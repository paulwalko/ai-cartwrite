President Gurnee said in ..i3 column, "During the next year, careful
preparation by each Grotto can make zile contributions to this agenda more

This coming year lets have resolutions worthy of discussion, and dis-
cussion worthy of being needed. If these don't exist,tthen let's forget

DON'T GATE TIIAT CAVE!
At the NSS National Veention in Custer, South Dakota, a round table
siscussion of conservation problems was held, Modorated by Vic Schmidt,
the Board of Governors , with some comments fron the membership at large,
discussed Joxeral topics in the conservation problon, but the most
enlightening anu thought provoking was the discussion of gating caves
to limit the freedom of acuess. Tiis discussion and a subsequent artiu
appearingboth in the NSS News and the Baltimore Grotto Newe, written by
Bill Plummer, have prompted this article.
At the discussion in South Dakota, I was amazed to find the difference
in the conservation problems in different sectors of the United States.
Qut west, in particular, the number of caves i3 sm.11, Eind tho mumbers
of rock collectors is innense. The rock hounds apparently think nothing
of looting a cave of every attractive speleothem they can find. Some
have been knorm to accompany competent cavias groups for the ole
purpose of locating caves to Wirich the can retur later and wreak their
havock. Tor this reason the book The Caves of California declines to
give the locations of many caves, or gives them in such vague terms that
they cannot be found solely from possession of the book. Also, many
caves have been l.cked to prevent tiewe vandals from destroying every
trace of natural beauty. It seems to me that under these conditions it
is proper to secure the entrance of caves against the ravaging hordes,
but - tilore are limitations,
As was pointed out in tho convention discussion, many well meaning
people are also li...ited by gates, and many people dostroy gates, simply
because they know of no other way of gaining entrance. It was sugested,
and I strongly agree, that overy gate placed on a cave entrance should
bear a certain amount of information. This information should be
plain'y evident and should include by whom the gate was laced, why it
was built, and what procedure e person might follow to gain entrance.
It this were done the builders on that the gate could scran out those they
folt undesiralbe, and yet the well meaning person could be admitted. A
locked ate night introduce a feeling of either feliance or curiosity
in its finder, both of which could be a peased by a proper explanation
and procedure for admittance.
