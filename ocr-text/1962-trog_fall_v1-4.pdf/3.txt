The Congress of Grottosa
As a result of the somewhat farc val meeting of the Congress of
Grottoos of the NSS which was held in South Dakota in June, it seems
time for a recovaluation of the duties and goals of the Congress and of
how nearly they are beine realized. The August NSS News carries a column
in which NSS president Gurnee very politely points to the waste of time
which will go down in history as the 1962 meeting of the Congress of Grottoes.
Even at the meeting & representative from the Pittsburgh Grotto very
boldly criticized the agenda offered and the general attitude, making
several noteworthy points which will be bought out in theremainder of
tiis text.
The Grottoes Congress is not á legislative body; it is merely e
sukcestive body. It is to test society opinion and make sueuestions to
the Board of Govenors. Resolutions sent to the Congress represent an area
or group and the Congress is to deliberate on these, test opinion from
yarious areas and points of vise, and make recommendations to the Board.
Recently many resolutions have dealt with matters that could be dealt
with merely by sending a letter to the appropriate person, or with matters
which are of general agreement but budgetarily Impossible Those
resolutions do not belong before the Congress, nor do resolutione hastily
submit.ed by groups, who have not given adequate thought to the possibke
consequences thereof.
A180, at the past two meetings which I have attended, it is not wcommon
for an individual' to step forward during a discusion and remarks, "The
Board of more discussed that yesterday and decidnd ..* If the
Congreus 18 to discuss society feeling why does the Board discuss mattere,
it kows are to be brought before the Congress shortly? Why not obtain
the opinion of the antire society's representatives as a guide before
disposing of themat ter. The NSS Constitution states, "Presolutions (that
are pagaed) must be considered by the Board of Governors at its next
regular neatins."
In South Dakota one of the Board members spoke on the floor of the
Congress openly mocking a resolution of the Congress. It certainly did
not indicate' any high regard beld for the Congress' proceedings, but it
did serve to point out the pettiriess and absurdity of the discussion
in progress.
