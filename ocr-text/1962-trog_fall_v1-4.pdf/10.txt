practices what it preaches, "and they were unable to discover
any official VPI Grotto activities."
Since to my knowledge none of the people mentioned as
part1 cipants in this group have øver attended a function of
the VPI Grotto I do not see how they are qualified to evaluate
any divergence between theory and actual practice which
they have failed to enumerate and I am not familiar with.
A grotto is not an entity in itself. It is a group of
individuals, and the activities of those individuals con-
stitutes the activities of the Grotte. During the months
September through June the individuals of the VPI Grotto
are able to act jointly and constitute what is probably
the most active single caving organization in this country.
During this past summer bretto members returned to their
homes and "official grotto activities ranged over no 1988
than six atates, including at least three members who
stayed on campus. Had the group in question chosen te
affiliate with the grotto, the on-campus "official activities"
would have been substantially increased. In addition, any
mmber of the VPI Grotto 18 free to propose any alteration
in either theory or practice, and 11 1t has herit, there la
no reason to doubt that it would be adopted.
In conclusion, we emphasize the unfortunate conflict
that could result from such a move on the part of the U. Va.
Grotto. We do not feel that any action along this line
would be consistent with the best interest of the NSS and
the purposes of the grøttoes thereof. We express hope that
the U. Va. Grotto w111 note continue on its present course;
and we invite Mr. Overman and his companions to give the
VPI Grott® an honest chance.
