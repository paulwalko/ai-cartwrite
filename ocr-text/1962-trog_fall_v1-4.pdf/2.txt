.. In keeping with the tradition of caving publications, we
have delayed publication of this, the fall quarter issue, until
the beginning of the winter quarter in order that it might not
be considered unusual in appearing on schedulo
It is appropriate that we open this issue by extending
sincere thanks to those people whose help was responsible for
the appearance of the summer 18sue: to my mother who typed
most of the stencils (there is a noticeable drop in quality
on the two that I aia); to Mr. Collin E. Smither , principal
of the Robert E. Lee High School in staunton, Va. and his
seoretary M18 Cook for their a981stance in mimeographing
that issue; and to Bonnie Stephenson who did the addressing
and ma ili11g.
Articles on the local situation pertaining to the use of
caves as follout Shelters and a description of Craig County
Saltoetre Cave to accompany the map, which were promised for
the summer issue, are contained in this issue.
