THE TECII TROGLODYTI, VOL. I, NO. 4
iloveyr, I feel that in this area, and in the other dense cave regiong
of the United States, that eating caves is largely unnecessary. It
is not the answer. The number oi caves 13 large anú the rock collectors
pose no creat threat. I feel that little of the vandalism in this area
is of a purely malicious nature. Tee answer to our conservatin problems.
would seem to be education and example. Both of these must begin within
ourselves and the cavers we are associated with. Cave owners should be
impressed with the need for conservation measures and then in turn they
can convey it to their visitors.
The NSS cave register program is excellent. The explorer has a
place to leave nis mark without damaging the cave's beauty, also he is
introduced to the existence anü location of the nearest cavine group.
Instoad of gates we silould have plaques encouraging conservation and
telling the visitor about the local grottor · Instead of building gates
we should spent our time and woney restoring thowell traveled caves.
The temptation to write your name is much stronger if there are already
dozens of otliers; or what is one more flashbulb iſ a pile has already
accumulated. A person can be impressed by the urmar:red beauty of a cave.
If his first one is liks that bn mey have more respect for the second
enú tie third, also. A now caver will also have more respect for conser
vation if his teachers do likevise; and even an unorrianized group will
be more tampted to practice sood conservation of .ine cove is clean and
tiiey facl that previous visitors have resected tha natural beauty of
their environment.
Ilie should not lock out the numerous cavers unknown to us, we should
ma.se an effort to search them out, teach them correct, procedures, oncourage
them to continue, but in a proper manners. The upcoxing NSK Convention
in Virginia could be an excellont ppportunity to gain considerable
publicity and locd these free lance pavers to us; enů a properly directed
approach to zave owners could be effective all of tile time. shy not leave
enouga informat on so that when John Doekes goes into vis save the former
can suggest, * You Euys ought to get toeeth'r witil some of those fellows
in tile Pogunks Grotto."
Wien I mad Plunmoris article indicating that he Baltimore Grotto
intended to put a second bock on overy geted gave they found, I assumed
that is vas written in a jocular: tone, but it did have a point. I build
a cate and then only I can set in. John we finds the eatenues 'wo 130u
where, who,, or why, so one of two things happens m eitier he breaks the
gute and goos in, or he is limited in his freddom to explore our under
ground, flowever concientious ho may be.
Det It is interesting to note tiut wille visiting the first Baltimore
Grotto meeting to follow publication 6 Plucr's article, I listened
to their plans to place a gato on a nearby cave.
Gatins cavos for scientific study is another point ir question.
It :90ms to me that .tin caveir neoded for studies where the omission
of human travel mau cjsential could be comparctively small. It
also soems t hats caves dissentially lacking in beautiful c.dornment or
athletic challen, é rould serve equally well, and that the gatos could
be constructod to indicate by snom and why tiny were built.
