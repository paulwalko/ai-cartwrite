19. Returning to the Andersons we told them about tne cave.
They told us about some other caves near Maiden Creek, and we
started out with five tomatoes and some good instructions, com-
pliments of a wonderful family.
We stopped at the house indicated by Mr. Anderson and two
boys about 10 told us of three caves. Two had been well
explored but the other had hed few visitors because of a 50'
drop. We were immediately interested and asked if we could
camp there for the night. One of the boys asked his aunt and
we suddenly found ourselves invited to sleep inside.
That settled, we began to explore Hopain's Cave. The
entrance was similar to Butler's Cave, but wider. The drop
was located about five feet inside and turned out to be an
easy 10' chimney. After 20, we hit a I intersection. The
left side was smalled and had a loop in ito. Bob discovered
this loop when he descended to the bottom of a 40 pit and
followed the passage back almost to the entpance, where it
hooked back into the main passage.
The cave was 8t111 full of surprises, for the right-hand
passage consisted of a series of pits and was like a miniature
Sohool house. We sorambled up a wall, down into a pit, up the
other side, and down again. The ceiling was high above us and
slippery mud was everywhere. The filth pit was different. At
the bottom of it were two holes that made a sheer drop of 25
into another pit. I managed to plant myself on a crumbling
ledge and nearly 811d down into the holes before Bob rescued
me.
Agreeing to tackle the drop with a rope the next day, we
emerged from the cave and ate supper. We were interrupted by
a hard rain, and in the rush we discovered that we had tossed
all of our muddy gear into the back seat of our car.

As we were preparing for bed Byron made the delightful
observation that the house looked like the one in Psycho,
Was the closest to the door, but the rain outside more than
made up for the unpleasants thoughts.
After breakfast one of the boys asked to go with us and
I was nominated to serve as his bodyguard. After rigging the
ropes, Byron descended into the pit, which was dead-end. There
was a pool of water near one wall that extended far under tne
wall. Both Bob and Byron attempted to a imb up the other side,
but could not reach the top.
The young boy with us mentioned a cave with a 100' drop.
He guided us there and we decided to return the next day.
There were a number of caves in the Lebanon area, 80 We
went there. We checked out two caves that have impressive
entrances but do not go very far,
