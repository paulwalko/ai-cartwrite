FIVE DAYS IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA
by Gary McCutcnen
on August 20, Bob Stoller, my brother Byron, and I set, aut
Per Abingdon, Ve. to do some caving. Bob 18 Pete Stollers
twin brother, and therefore both Byron and I called him Pete
half of the time. By the end of the trip Bob ariswered to
either name.
After an hour's delay (Bob's alarm didn't go off) we set
out. About. 6 p.. Abingdon came into view. we looked up Bob
McCrady. & Techman and part-time caver, and he told us about
a cave 5 or 6 miles out of town.
We had no trouble finding the cave which we were told was
galled Thompson's Cave. Mr. Anderson told us that we were
welcome to visit the cave and also gave us permission t# camp
in his field. After eating supper, We set up camp above a
spring which we were told came from inside the cave.
Just as we were dozing off a group of cows became curious
abouto us. When one tried to lick Bob's face, he decided to sit
#utside for awhile. Finally both the cows and bob settled down
and we all slepte.
We woke all "bright-eyed and bushy-tailed" about 8 a. Ilie
Mr. Anderson dropped by and asked us to stop back if we had
time and tell him what the cave was 11ke, ad this we gladly
did.
The entrance was in a sink and led steeply downward. Tlae
passage then went both directions. The left side ended after
40 fe to 80 We tried the right À 30' slope brought us to a pito
Bob and Byron checked the pit and I continued in the passage
which went off at a 90 degree angle. Mr. Anderson told 48
later that when he had been in the cave 30 years ag® the pit
was 70 fee to deep and was impossible to enter without a rope.
He also said that ther was no mud at all. We found mud every-
where. I found two other pits, and then the upper passage
end ed, so I descended the first of the two pits. I had justo
begun when Byron and Bob emerged from a crawl way that connected
the two pits. After looking around, we climbed out and tried
the last pit, which was also 20 feet deep.
We were trying to head toward the springs so we choso @
right-hand passage first. It showed signs of periodic
flooding. A trickle of water led along this passage into a
small room that gave us several crawl leads. The floor of the
room was covered with dirt filled rimstone pools, and the trickle
disappeared into a tiny opening. The opening was all that was
left of a fairBizedpassage, now filled with hard-packed mud.
We returned to the pit and conreated it to the second one
by means of a ridioulously nasty crawl way through breakdown,
It took me five minutes to go five feet.

Emerging from the cave, we went to townfor ice and a county
