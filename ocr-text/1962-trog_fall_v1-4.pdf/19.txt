By 10 on Thursday, we were on our way back to the "100"
pit". We left all gide passages unchecked and arrived at the
drop in 15 minutes. Believe it or not, we had a real 70" pit.
There were three ledges; the first was easy to reach 8 We all
slid down to it. The rope had been rigged up above and Bob
wanted an opportunity to find virgin passage, go he went down
first. It was all virgin and there were a number of big rooms.
After 45 minutes Bob returned to the rope and began to
prussik out. He soon discovered that an against-the-wall
prussik with a stream of water running over hidi was no picnic,
especially when his light went out about one third of the way
upo
We had intended to explore the rest of the cave in hopes
of other pits and another, route to the lower level streem Bob
had discovered, but when e looked around and dazedly asked
which way to go (the only route was right in front of him), We
agreed to call a halt for lunch.
We were told of two other caves, which also sounded good,
but we decided to explore Doughtery's Cave (near Lebanon) since
several people had mentioned 1te.
Doughtery's had the best formations of any of the caves we
had seen. It was an easy walk-through cave, and can be
completely explored in thirty minutes. There were a number of
bones in the cave, and at least one cave salamanier.
After a hearty breakfast on Friday, we packed up and headed
toward a. C. with the radio blaringe bob talking, and cold air
blowing through the windows to be sure that I wouldn't fall asleep.
Editor's Note: Coordinates of these caves are still being
computed and compared with existing records for possible correl-
ation with previously reported caves. Exact locations and pos-
sible other names will be reported in a future 113 sue of the

TRIP REPORT POLICY
Because of the tremendous number of trips that go out during
a quarter and the amount of space that would be required to carry
trip reports for thirty some trips; it, is the policy of this
publication to carry trip reports only on trips to new caves,
trips to very seldom visited (by us) caves, trips of unusual
size or accomplishment, or trips on which significant or unusual.
studies or observations are made. Is It that our members are
not making any trips of this nature, or are they just too lazy
to write them up?
