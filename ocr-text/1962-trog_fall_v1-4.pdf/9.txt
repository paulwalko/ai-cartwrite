AN UNFORTUNATE CONFLICT
sempre
Recently, the Cavalier Caver, publication of the U. Va.
Grotto of the Nss carried an article by Jse Overman reading,
"While at Virginia Polytechnic Institute this summer, I had
an opportunity to do some caving in Southwest Virginia. Due
to the inactivity of the VPI Grotto, I formed a small club
of my own. It has now been organized into the VPI extension
and is seeking recognition from the U.Va. Grottaro If recog-
nized by the 0. Va. Grettor the VPI extension will act as

prominente in those localities and to promote the purposes
of the NSS... LWe] feel that it would be indeed unfortunate
for two grottoes to be organized in such a manner that they
operated in dire ot competition with each other.
It 18 hoped that the U.Va. Grottwill pay heed to
this dis aussion and act a ocordingly when considering legis-

and its various chapters."
: In a gubsequent latter Mr. Geil charged that "They
have refused to join the VPI Grotto because they disagree
with some of the practices of your group. This group agrees
wholeheartedly with your stated by-laws and codes, but
finds a dlaagreeable divergence between theory and actual
practice. They have asked for U.V, Grotto membership
because they wish to affiliate themselves with a Grotto tlaat
