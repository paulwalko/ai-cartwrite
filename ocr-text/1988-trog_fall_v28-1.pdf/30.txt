"...by going into a cave and examining the animals, there, itsa, people get a
better understanding of what's going on with, ya know, pollution..."
The previous statement, given by our VPI Cave Club president Ben Keller,
exemplifies why he was elected to his lofty position. Here, he demonstrates that in
a high-pressure situation before a TV camera he can indeed think on his feet. As
with any politician's statement, one needs to stop and think a while on what has
been uttered. The cryptic association of animals and people with the special
conjunctions "itsa" and "ya know" shows that Ben was communicating on several
different levels. Let me explore the various shades of meaning within this
statment so we can all appreciate how Ben's mind works.
First, being a politician, what Ben does not say is as important as what he .
does say. Fortunately, he gave no clue to the location of the cave, thus preserving
its beauty for those in the know. However he did not mention anything about
increasing club dues, so we can be expecting a price hike in the spring to cover the
Club's "deficit spending."
Anyway, the issues in the statement seem garbled. How can we determine
the true meaning only from what he said? Tough job. Examine the following logic
progression:
examine
people --------> animals (therefore)
understand
people -------------> pollution
Wha? Let me have a beer and maybe this will seem clearer to me...
Now, something about looking at animals makes people understand
pollution, right? Well, I look at my fish and I don't even think about garbage.
Maybe dinner. Looking at garbage in a cave might make feel sorry for the animals
who live there, but then, it would not be hard to feel sorry that lives in a cold,
dark, wet puddle. (Ed. note -- Hey, I resemble that remark. Except, I live in a dry
puddle.) Heck, they might even enjoy a dose of stale beer to give their lives a lift.
Another beer, aaaaah. Back to Ben. Ben is an intellegent guy, he doesn't go
around making random statements. Obviously, the meaning is hidden, and we
aren't supposed to know. I guess it's the job of a leader to know and the masses to
follow. I think that's why he has a young republican for a VP.

Ed. Note:
After long and strenuous deliberation, Ben declared Mr. Uknalis
the contest winner for his outstanding logical analysis. Mr.
Cruickshank was declared runner-up with honorable mention for
his excellent use of logicaver analysis, that is, logical
reasoning involving intensive and extended alcohol comsumption..
Mr. Uknalis will receive a single can of The Beast, and Mr.
Cruickshank will receive the remainder of the 12-pack.
