Surveying is an important part of caving. That is what I learned on my last
caving trip. I know that many of you have done it before, but it was my first time, so
it was new. For you, this can be a reminder of your first trip. For those of you
haven't done it before, especially trainees, this can be an idea of the experience you
will have someday when you survey.
As a first time person, I was the lead tape of the survey crew. At first, I was
not sure how exciting it was going to be. Why should they give a fun job to a first
time surveyor? Reading an instrument, horizontal and vertical direction, sounded
interesting. I always got a kick out of it before, but this time I would not be doing
it. Sketching out the places we were going, showing everybody else what we were
seeing sounded like fun, but what I was doing was pulling a piece of tape along and
holding a light up to show the instrument reader where the next survey spot was.
Oh boy....
Actually, what I found it meant was that I was the first person in the virgin
passage. I was the person that had to be the most careful not to screw up the path,
see interesting formations and where to go next, and to make sure I didn't go to a
place where I was going to get myself in trouble (ie. fall down a pit or get myself
stuck.) The lead tape had both an easy job and a job with a lot of potential.'
Also, the fact that I was part of a survey crew was important. There were only
three of us. All the other trips were basically sight seeing trips with many people.
Three is a minimum number as far as I could tell for safety. We had to watch each
other, but could not rely on somebody else watching you.
I quickly found out how important it was to keep your pack with you. I
figured...I am only going to the top of this drop; my pack will be close enough at the
bottom of this drop. Well, somebody in the end had to bring it up to me because
my light went out when my water spilled out after crawling through a hole.
You really realize how dark, silent, etc. it is when you are waiting without any
light. You just haven't turned it off, you don't have any light. Silence is peaceful,
thoughtful, and scary. I was glad I had just gone through a crawl that I could barely
fit through before my light dimmed out.
Then it was back on to more surveying. It keeps you very busy, but you don't
move fast, which is really nice. Normally, I have gone sight seeing -- zipping past
most of the cave to specific sights. Surveying let me see every inch of the cave, and
gave me time to examine the rock structure, flow stone, straws, animals, etc.
And to make it more exciting is that nobody knows this passage. Not only are
all the sights virgin but the methods to get through the passage are virgin.
Everybody's a beginner again. It's chance to think and apply what you know, not
just follow the lead of others. You can give names to things, a tight crawl,
formation, or whatever even though I had no names in mind and didn't see
anything too name-worthy. Well, we did go through some tight crawls but they
didn't go to any neat formation or sight, but they did keep going, bigger and
smaller. There was no way of knowing where the crawl went until the crawl was
done. Half of the times we saw it dead end quickly, and the other half of the time it
opened up into a wider passage.
Well, if you hadn't gathered, we did a lot of crawling on my first survey trip.
Every foot was well earned. At last, at one of the squeezes that had a drop
afterwards, I determined I was tired. The squeeze could be left for another day. We
only surveyed 200 feet -- seemed both like a lot and not much. We had never really
stopped to take a breather or talk. When we got out, it was dark and Doug asked
me, "Check the time." I did, and was I surprised -- a quarter till ten. Nine hours.
Nine hours and 200 feet. We wondered if we had broken a record for lowest
passage per hour. Time to go back and let Jim tally up our results.
