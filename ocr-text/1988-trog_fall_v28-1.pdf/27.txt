Larry got me to hold up in time for him to catch up. He had left his pack,
helmet and all of his lights in the fire. Duke and Tom came running, and we put
my Autolite on Duke's helmet, while I turned on my Durabeam. We asked Duke if
he was burned, and he said, "I don't know, my face burns, but let's get outta here."
We took off together, trying to suppress the pace for fear of oxygen depletion from
the flames.
Only Tom had his pack. Though his Premier went out initially, he still had it
and a reflectorless spare in his pack. Duke's lamp was blown off the bracket, and he
had been blown back ten feet from the hole before he "stopped, dropped and
rolled." Landing near Tom, he asked if he was on fire, to which Tom replied, "No,
but keep your head down and let's get out of here." They crawled the first 40 feet
with their noses to the floor, under Ã  ceiling of fire and heat. While running after
me, Larry looked back and saw two silhouettes crawling in a wall of flame! (We
later joked, "Where are the Australian video cavers when you need them?") He felt
a blast of heat. Tom and Duke looked back and saw a room full of blue flame, 10
feet wide and 3 feet high.
We made the trip back to the W.A.R. entrance (Dave Weller, ANFO, &
Frank Reid) in about 45 minutes. (It usually takes an hour and a half at a steady
pace.) Duke seemed OK, but we sent him up rope first. As Tom said, Duke
wanted out the most. Nobody said much as we fiddled with our vertical gear.
(Thank God there's just an entrance drop.) I had visions of flame rushing into the
room, or rumbling noises as the floor blew out from under our feet. I went up next,
and a very shaky voice floated down the culvert, "How you doin', Barbara?" When I
got up, Duke was sitting right where he had unrigged, white as a ghost for all the
"sunburn" under his eyes. "I was IN the fucking fire!"
Everyone exited without further incident. We took a picture of the "Survivors
of the Hicks Fire" gathered around the culvert, and discussed the possibility of
posing for a wienie/marshmallow roast over the hole. Tom told the neighboring
landowner all about the grey slime pit, while we all battled to keep our mouths shut
about day's most, uuh, well, exciting event. We hurried to the "Just Anywhere"
truck stop restaurant and called Jim Quinlan's answering machine. Tom tried a
few other numbers, and since Horse Cave wasn't burning on the horizon, we sat
down to eat, wonder at our incredibly bad/good luck and mourn the loss of survey
gear, cameras and packs.
The following day, Duke and Larry notified several appropriate individuals
and organizations: The Kentucky Division of Water, Dr. James Quinlan, Dr.
James Branstetter of Horse Cave, Bill Austin--also of Horse Cave and the owner of
the downtown entrance to Hidden River Cave, the Bowling Green Area
representative of the state Division of Environmental Management, the ACCA in
Horse Cave, and all cavers with keys to the culvert entrance. Duke's face was red
Sunday morning and later blistered, and he noticed Monday that he had lost a
chunk off the tip of one thumb.
The president of Bluegrass Grotto, a geologist with the state, visited the
Horse Cave area later that week. After talking with several farmers who had left
tobacco fields above the cave complaining of fumes, he concluded that the
explosion may have been liquid propane. Propane storage tanks are located next to
a railroad directly above the slump pit. The EPA in Atlanta has been notified, and
someone there has expressed interest in a gear-intensive return to the scene of the
explosion. As of this time, all that is certain is that something in Hicks Cave went
boom.
