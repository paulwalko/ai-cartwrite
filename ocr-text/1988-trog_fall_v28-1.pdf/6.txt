GROTTO GRAPEVINE
(The article that's not afraid to name names,
except those of its writers!)
Yo, dudes. It is once again that time of the year in which we try to collect all
the dirt on our various group members so that it will never be forgotten. As it has
been 7-8 months since the last "grapevine", you can expect lots in the following
paragraphs.
Proving that birds of a feather really do flock together, the households of
Cecile James and Jim Washington are collecting more cavers as the non-caving
residents move out. Cecile gained Jim Gamble downstairs, and Joe Uknalis
upstairs making a residence of 5 cavers. We also wonder about this since she is
now the only female to 5 males (although 2 are related so they don't really count.)
If you remember from the last "grapevine", Cecile was recognized for achieving
the highest male-female ratio on a cave trip. Is a pattern emerging? Cecile's
house is also home to 2 dogs (hers) and 2 cats (Jim and Joe's). Jim Washington
was joined in Newport by cavers Doug Dodd, Doug Bruce, and Mike Fiore. The
Washington household is now 100% cavers, although everyone there is very
proficient at playing "Leisure-suit Larry" and "Astro-tit"--we know that caving isn't
their only activity.
Float trip was commanded by Admiral Craig Roberts, recently retired from
office. Unfortunately for river traffic, the water was low, and launch was late, so
the would-be Tom Sawyer's spent a long day in the water. The last raft came out
of the water at 10:30 pm, which is nothing to be ashamed of, since the rafts of
Jerry Redder and Craig Roberts disintegrated en route. The Jim Washington
couch-raft ran aground at one point. There was the usual exchange of
bottle-rocket fire, with everyone equally at risk from Beth Wichterman's
unpredictable aim.
Float trip was not Jim Washington's only trouble with obstacles. A year ago,
Jim got stuck in Devil's pinch. This year, besides float trip, he has run into
trouble while surveying Stay High, and gotten stuck while taking trainees into
Echoll's cave. Application of trainee-power to both ends of Mr. Washington got
him out. Although not caving much this year, Ko Tak showed that his unique
talent has not suffered from inactivity by losing his way in Bane's Spring. Did he
ever find Whistling Wells? or the ball-crusher? Jim Gamble, Ben Keller, Cecile
James, Paul Hess, and Sally Pearson took a crew from WSLS TV-10 caving in
Tawney's cave for the viewing pleasure of arm-chair cavers (reportedly aired also
in Richmond and Va. Beach.) Cecile's ass got some special attention from the
camera man, and Paul and Ben were interviewed. Ben made an especially
memorable speech that will have scholars debating for years to come over exactly
what he meant. Earlier in the year, Tom Foster made a trainee trip especially
miserable by bringing Cindy, "the fucking cave dog", along.
Generally, the club has been a bit slack in organizing caving trips, but that will
hopefully change next semester as we get new blood in our membership. Our
