The Discovery of Yer Cave
.
On June 20, 1987, Doug Bruce and I were continuing my systematic ridgewalk
of Giles Co. limestone. We spent the better part of the day running up and down
hollows, over hills, through woods and pasture, talking to various landowners, and
sweating. By late afternoon we were burning out from miles of caveless terrain. I
knew of a few more unchecked sinkholes, so we decided to search just a little
longer.
I stopped the truck and we walked into one of these sinks and noticed a very
dramatic temperature drop. With a suden burst of energy, we frantically started
looking under rocks and into little fissures for the source of the cave air. On the
north end of the sink Doug pushed a small fissure for about 30' before it became
too tight. Momentarily thwarted, we looked nearby and found a large boulder,
under which was a small crevice issuing blasts of cold air. We enlarged it by pushing
rocks and dirt into a small nearby pit. When the hole reached its maximum of 1'X
2', we realized the need for a rope -- back to the truck for gear.
The entrance belled into a 14' pit with a 10' X 15' passage trending
downward. We were off and running with more enthusiasm than we had ever
allotted to the chase of a woman. The passage tended to go steadily down in a
northwest direction until it ended in a tight gravel choked crawl with no air flow.
We had reached a depth of -139' in 450'. We had seen no side passages, but had
completely lost the air flow. The cave wanted to play games.
Back at the bottom of the entrance pit we wondered where the air could be
coming from; the only possibility was the breakdown on the right wall. A moment's
poking around revealed air flow at floor level coming from under the rock. As we
removed rocks, we were able to follow a contorting crawl into breakdown and
pseudo-passage. Air was coming from everywhere, so we decided to split up to
force the way on.
I dropped over a ledge into a small room which had a hole in the corner
blowing a strong breeze. I enlarged a small hole, and was able to climb down into a
tight fissure, then a vertical slot, then through a barely-larger-than-body size
S-bend crawl into a downward-sloping passage, belly-crawl style. I hit an
intersection which had a canyon going up left and down right. Following the air in a
downstream direction, I fissured and canyoned into ever increasing passage
dimensions -- to another intersection. Folks, it was Booty Time! Vrooomm!
But what about Doug? I retraced my steps and found him by shout location.
All the while he had been creating cave by the rock removal method and was now
throwing these rocks down a pit well in excess of 100' which emitted a
mind-blowing echo!!
There was one more rope in the truck, a 150'. Exiting, we excitedly discussed
what we had found and said all those false statements like, "This is better than sex."
It wasn't long before we were back at the pit with rope. We spent some time
stabilizing the area around the top of the pit, since there are no real walls, ceiling,
or floor, just breakdown. We rigged the rope and descended a beautiful pit that
went free for 101' to a set of ledges that could be rapelled or climbed for another

The end of. our rope was lying in a pool of water on a balcony overlooking an
enormous trunk disappearing into blackness left and right! The barely visible floor
looked to be about 50' down -- and we were out of rope. This was the first of many
times in which cavers would run out of rope in this cave. We whooped and
hollered, threw rocks, and jumped up and down. We had found a big cave. The
