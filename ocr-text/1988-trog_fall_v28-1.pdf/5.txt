last thanks goes to a very special person who was a great help in the cleaning effort
following the Halloween party, Mike Fiore. Feel free to bow, Mike.
Cave safe, but hard. But above all, don't believe me when I tell you the CRF
Thanksgiving Expedition is a week long.

ԵՆ,
Well, once again I am saddled with the dubious pleasure of editing a Trog
during the last-week-of-the-semester crunch. Pardon me if I seem like Mr.
Negative, I'm still worn out from cleaning up Cecile's place after the Halloween
party. Actually, I feel fairly well about this issue, the fourth of my sentence, er,
tenure as editor of this fine publication. I would like to thank everyone who
contributed material (whether fluent or wretched), or helped out on the technical
end (especially Jim W., Doug B., and Ko T.). In fact, the old fasioned stressful
type-cut-Zip-A-Tone-bitch-n-paste method of editing has given way to the high
tech type-save-lose data-retype-n-crash method of editing, equally stressful. If at all
possible, please submit future material on Volkswriter-compatible disks. It will
save us at least some of the typing hassle. Also, drinking while writing for the Trog
is fine if it fuels your creative juices, but, please, please, please, proofread your
copy before you submit it. "andd we rappellesd away from ont tor and next to the
///w33/casserole is friendship" will NOT DO....
I'm looking for an assistant editor for the spring Trog, since I may (gasp)
actually graduate soon, and will have to pass on the Editorship. Anyone with a
shred of verbal or graphic creativity, ambition, or gullibility is encouraged. Just let
me know if you are interested. Also, if you have any pictures or drawings with a
caving theme that you would like to see in print, please talk to me. I'd like to see if
the Trog can take on more of a magazine-like format in the spring. Thanks again to
all who submitted an article. And remember, dangle ropes, not participles.
