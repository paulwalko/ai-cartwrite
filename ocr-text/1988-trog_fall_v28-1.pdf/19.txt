The Hel of Echols Cave
Several reasons why not to go into Echol's Cave:
1. Your name happens to be Jim Washington.
2. You plan on going out after coming in.
3. You are Andy Randall and have an electric light.
4. You are Scott Rapier and carry Durabeam flashlights.
To explain further...
Here begins the saga of the October 8 survey trip into Echol's Cave. It began
innocuously with a trio of happy-go-lucky cavers, and quickly became so much else.
Echol's Cave had just been rediscovered, and we had been sent out to check the
real cave against what had been reported in the past. Seeing the entrance to this
cave was slightly less exciting than seeing the entrance to a groundhog lair. In fact, I
believe the entrance is somewhat smaller than that. Andy quickly showed us that he
could get in and out. This left me, the lead tape, looking at the little hole in despair.
My computer monitor was bigger than that entrance. Yet, gamely we ventured
forth; I went ahead and skewed my torso down. If you ever look at Andy, you will
notice that he is a thin person. Jim and I, well, aren't quite so thin, but believe it or
not, managed to negitiate the entrance. Onward to survey land! The first side
passage I went into yielded a pleasant surprise -- remains from some unlucky
creature. I ended finding bones littered throughout, which is not the most
comforting thing to find. A popular joke to the two behind me was, "If it's a bear, at
least we can get out while it devours you!" Needless to say, it wasn't a popular joke
with me.
About five or six stations into the cave, we came across another area that was
to prove bothersome. An immobile rock was stationed in the center of the passage.
Andy (yeah, the thin one) quickly demonstrated to me how to negotiate this space.
I didn't enjoy it, but with some effort I managed to squeese through, too. I moved
up the passage and kept marking stations while Andy read compass. It got to a
point where I was scrunched up with my feet in the air while Andy read the shot
under my legs to a point behind me, as Jim tried to get through the tight spot. Due
to my position and the fact that I couldn't move, all I could hear was a muffled
"whumph". It soon became clear to me that Jim had gotten stuck. Andy did the best
he could to help, and after a long period, Jim managed to make it through. Getting
back out --we didn't even want to think about that.
Immediately thereafter, my light died. Even though the passage was only 18
inches high, I managed to change batteries and go on. We entered a large room and
went on surveying, then... Andy's light died. He ignored this and used a small
flashlight to read the Brunton. Later, while surveying the main room, my flashlight
died again and refused to work anymore. Andy eventually hauled out a carbide
lamp and replaced his electric lamp. We discovered a NSS number (37), then found
several 1955 dates, other names, and a pretty little red salamander. Overall, the
cave was extremely pretty and, much to our surprise, had a large amount of
formations.
Anyway, we completed surveying the entire cave and got ready to move on
out. The tight spot was the only real worry we had, after all, what else could go
wrong? I went first, and Jim got himself as far as he could. Between my pulling and
Andy's pushing, we had Jim safely extricated and through in a remarkably short
time, and we all went right on out. On the way back to the car, thoughts of whether
the car would still be there, or if we would meet some "Deliverance"-styled
rednecks ran through our heads. Well, the car was there, and nothing else befell us.
All in all, Jim summed it up with, "That's the last time I go into that cave!"
