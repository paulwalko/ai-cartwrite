Tragedy in Pig Hole
Saturday, Sept. 24, 1988, two Va. Tech students decided to go caving. Both
Jeff Snyder and Rex Linville had attended a few cave club meetings, but neither
were club members. Each had been caving with friends numerous times.
Jeff and Rex signed in at the cave owner's register before entering. This was
the first time either of them had been in Pig Hole. They went in the back entrance
around 10:30 am. Each wore appropriate clothing, had MSA helmets with chin
straps and carbide lamps, and carried fanny-packs with extra sources of light. Jeff
wore tennis shoes, while Rex had on lug sole boots.
Jeff and Rex started at the back entrance of Pig Hole and began exploring. By
noon, the two had made their way to the Mud Bridge. Since the two were
unfamiliar with the cave, they were unaware of the drops around the Mud Bridge.
Continuing to explore, Jeff wanted to see where a ledge below where he was
standing went. Without a belay, Jeff slowly began climbing down to the ledge. At
eye level to the floor, and without any indication, Jeff slipped.
As he fell to the bottom of Hess's Hollow, Jeff may have hit the ledge he was
trying to climb to. (Best guess as to the distance fallen is 60'.) Rex yelled to Jeff
several times, trying to get a response, but only heard moaning.
At this point, Rex decided to exit the cave by the back entrance to call for a
rescue. At approximately 12:30pm, Rex made it out of the cave and to the
landowners. The landowner called Giles County dispatch, which alerted Giles Co.
Rescue Squad and their cave rescue team. The next phone call was placed to the
Va Tech police by Rex, requesting help from the VPÃŒ Cave Club.
At 12:35pm, I received a call from the Va Tech police indicating a cave
rescue was needed and was given a call back number. I talked with Rex to
determine where they were and what had happened. Since Rex could not describe
exactly where in the cave Jeff had fallen, I instructed Rex to reenter the cave and to
stay at the location where Jeff had fallen.
I called Glen Davis, the club's cave rescue callout person. He was not home
so I initiated the call out. I called Carol and Joe Zokaites, Ben Keller, Jim Gamble,
Ed Fortney, Dave and Nancy Shantz, Muke Futrell, Mike Fiore, Bob Alderson,
Suzanne Sutherland, Jim Littlefield, Knox Worde, Craig Ferguson, Doug Perkins,
and Jean Hartman. A large majority of the other club members were out on cave
trips. Kay Johnson agreed to take over telephone communications from my home.
When the first cavers arrived on the scene, Giles Co. Rescue Squad and
Newport Fire Department were already at both entrances. The cavers were
informed that the squads' rescue team (2 members without ropes) had entered the
cave moments before. (We were led to believe there were more than 2 squad
members in the cave.) Mike Fiore and Mike Futrell rappelled in the top entrance
and proceeded to the Mud Bridge at approximately 1:45pm. Within 5 minutes Joe
and Carol Zokaites followed by Dave Shantz went in the back entrance. Nancy
Shantz stayed outside to maintain the rescue.log.
Joe, Carol, Dave, Mike and Mike reached the Mud Bridge at approximately
2:00pm. Rex was there still trying to get a response from Jeff. (Note that Mike and
Mike passed the 2 squad members heading toward the pit entrance.) A rope was
