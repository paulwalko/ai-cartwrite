President's Column
This has been one of those semesters that defies description. We seem to have a
wonderful group of prospective members who will probably be able to bring the club out
of its "old fart rut." This is surprising considering that after our first monster meeting
(which we totally screwed up), we skipped a week for Old Timers. Another surprise is
that more didn't leave after the death of Jeff Snyder in Pig Hole. I think this is a good
indication that we have a pretty hard-core group who will be around for some time.
The death of Jeff Snyder was certainly one of the events which has had the greatest effect
on the club in quite a while. Jeff had been to at least one meeting, but had never been
caving with the club. I don't think there was any question that his death was caused by
anything other than bad judgement, but it made me stop and think about some issues which
have been discussed before. The major one relates to those people who less than half-way
through the "training" we provide, decide that they are experts and can go off on their own.
The question that concerns me is: "Do these people have the common sense required to
stay alive?" The common sense aspect of caving is not something that we explicitly teach,
instead people either already have it or they pick it up by observing the more experienced
members freak out in certain places. It is very aggravating to see people abandon the
trainee program in midstream but continue caving, it would be even more aggravating to
see them get hurt or die in a cave.
Because of Jeff's death Jackie discovered that she had not been covered by the
University's liability insurance as Faculty Advisor. This prompted Jackie to resign. She
also discovered that the club had no University coverage and is no longer a University
sponsored student organization (they just let us and other groups register with them so
people can find us). This was a shock (although it has been this way for some time), some
concern was raised about liability and our status as a student grotto. Eventually, I asked
for volunteers for committees to study liability issues and changes to be made to our
constitution. Jean Simonds volunteered for the Liability committee and Jim Washington
for the Constitution committee.
At this point it appears the best step toward reducing liability is for the club to
incorporate, and such a motion was made at our last official meeting before Thanksgiving.
The constitutional issue may be a little stickier. Because the school has set us "free," we
may now have non-techies as voting members. This means that the old farts could do more
than heckle from the back of the room, and even could become officers. So the question
we will be voting on soon is whether we should retain the classes of membership we
currently have, or just have prospective members and members.
One thing that I've learned about this semester is the press. Between saying
undecipherable things during a TV interview about why people go caving, saying wimpy
things to Collegiate Times reporters about why Jeff Snyder is dead, and sounding arrogant
in interviews with Campus Voice, I seem to have been doing a fairly good job of screwing
up with the press. The printing of a map showing the general region of Pig Hole by the
Roanoke Times and World News caused me to write a letter to the publisher (the letter and
its rather unsurprising, but still nauseating response is printed later). The lesson for
readers of the "news," take it with a grain of salt. The lesson for "makers" of the news,
DONT. Actually, we hope to make news releases in the future, instead of letting things go
wild.
Despite the fact that I am ready for my term to end soon, I am very happy with the soon
to be new members that have put up with us this long. I would like to thank those people
that helped some of these people like caving by going on trainee trips. (If I leave anyone
out please don't shoot me, just think of it as one of my infinite number of screw-ups this
year.) Jerry Redder, Cecile James, Walt Pirie, Jim Gamble, Ko Takamazawa, Jim
Washington, Philip Balister, Mike Fiore, and Doug Bruce. I'd especially like to thank Ed
Fortney who put up posters, and went on more than his share of trips. At the practice
rescue Ed did a bang-up job at organizing, and Carol Zokaites, Craig "the Stink" Roberts,
and the every gracious patient Kay Johnson helped a great deal. Paul Hess should be
thanked for not getting the second year VP blues too soon, and for doing a great job. My
