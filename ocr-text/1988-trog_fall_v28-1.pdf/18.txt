left-hand lead.
Ko squirmed through the straight-ahead lead and was not impressed. I did
not fit at all, so we began to examine the left-hand lead. At floor level was a .
crawlway that looked too small for Ko to fit through. But nearby was a hole in the
floor, and down through that small hole in the floor was a larger crawlway. A few
minutes of hammering turned the small hole into a hole big enough for Ko. Ko
went through, and for the second time in a month, I was left on the wrong side of
a small hole with reports of big passage on the other side. (Hint: If you want to
taunt Jim from virgin passage, both you and the way to the passage must be
smaller than Jim.) Meanwhile, Ko had left his pack with Cecile and me, and, as
usually happens in such inopportune circumstances, his lamp got dim and nearly
went out. Not being able to see the direction he came from, Ko returned to us
through the floor-level crawl that we had dismissed earlier as too small. Hence
the name "Ko Crawls" for the passage, even though only one of the crawls is
ordinarily used. With Ko back with us, Cecile and I handily hammered the rock
until even I would fit. On the other side, we saw wonderful things: Wide,
sandy-floored passages, a really big stream, a few formations, a fifteen-foot dry
waterfall with dragons roaring above the top. Cecile, Ko, and I surveyed what we
could and found more wonders: more leads!
