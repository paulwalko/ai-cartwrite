trainees showed lots of promise on the recent Ed Fortney practice rescue in which
the club retrieved a "pregnant" Kay Johnson from New River cave. Craig Roberts
joined us that weekend wearing cave clothes that hadn't been washed since he last
rolled in a cow pasture. Although tied in a position which prevented seeing
anything but the ceiling, the victim was able to tell whenever Craig was near by
the "significant odor". No, it wasn't English Leather.
Convention was in South Dakota this year, and a number of VPI cavers
attended. Maureen Handler took part in the rodeo. Also at convention, the Jerry
Redder/Joan Hederick relationship took an interesting turn with Joan promising
to go caving if Jerry would ride a horse, and Jerry promising to ride a horse if
Joan would go caving. Cecile claims that love was the motivation. Ain't it great?
Craig Ferguson and Jeff Jablonski drove to convention on a shoe-string budget
(rumor now has the budget as low as $5). The cavers present consumed many
bat-suckers and cakes which were donated by the local church ladies.
OTR this year was a small series of very memorable events. Our club
celebrated two imminent weddings with showers for Jackie Redder and Linda
Oxenreider. Entertainment was provided by Dougo, Paul Kirchman, and Richard
"Dick" Cobb as they ventured into the amateur world of stripping. Richard Cobb
came dressed as his wife, wearing nothing underneath. (Does this mean his wife
doesn't wear underwear?) Richard Cobb's act included audience
participation--provided by Pat Shorten as she tied a ribbon around his pecker.
(You never know where those knots you learn as a trainee will come in useful!)
Paul Kirchman gave a "professional performance and Dougo showed promise,
although it was agreed that he won't reach full potential until after puberty. The
ladies then enjoyed a game of "Pin the pecker on Peter" which Cecile won.
(Deduct 5 points from Cecile's purity score!) Finally, what was Doug Perkins
doing while the group waited for the full-volume blast of "Deutchland uber alles"
to wake them up? Was perhaps the distracting presence of Carolann Curry a
factor?
Since the last printing of a "grapevine" our club has seen an unusual number
of tragedies. During exam week of spring quarter last year, the club was called
out for a rescue in Roanoke. During the rescue, Jerry Redder slipped and fell,
toppling a rescue squad member who broke his arm when he fell. For this and
other reasons, our relations with the Roanoke rescue squad are rather bad at the
moment. Only recently, our area had the first death in almost 30 years. The club
was called out to rescue a non-member who fell from the mud bridge in Pig Hole.
Knox Worde and Ben Keller commented on the practices of reporters with letters
to the Roanoke Times as a result of articles printed about the incident. A lesser
tragedy occured this fall when Cecile slipped and broke her leg. One operation
and 8 weeks in a cast later, she is as good as new. One final sad note is the death
of Jackie's dog Kaiser.
Being in a cast did not prevent Cecile from caving. With some clever
jury-rigging, she designed some special boots to protect the cast and went into
Links and Mammoth Cave. Some kind of die-hard caver award is in store for her
at banquet time. Cecile is also starting a business in the fabrication of caving
clothes (Cecile's Wunderwear.) Models are needed!
