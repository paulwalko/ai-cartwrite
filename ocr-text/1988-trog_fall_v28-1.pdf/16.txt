The Discovery, Naming, and Exploration of Stay High Cave:
The First Three Trips
Jim Washington: It all started out on March of this year. Dave Colatosti and
I were working on GCCS, hoping to finish up the Newport Quad as far as cave
locations were concerned. We had recently done the survey of Sibolds (Sipolls)
Cave. The remaining caves on the quad, Clover Hollow Cave, Collins Cave, Jim
Millers Cave, Farriers Cave, Hutch's Horror, Huffman Cave, Newport Cave and
Canoe Cave were all either previously surveyed, closed, or too horrible to survey.
All except Lucas Cave, which we hoped to find and survey on that day. Nobody
was home there, so we continued down the Clover Hollow road to do, well, we
didn't know what.
Now, there was one road I hadn't been on in the Hollow, and since we had
nothing better to do, we drove up it. Maybe some ridge-driving would lift our
spirits. I began relating the story about how this area had been tromped on for
years by VPÄª Cave Club, notably by Thierry, Saunders, Ortiz, Douty, and
Koerschner. I was just getting to the part about computer punches and green wells
when Dave asked me about the little hole in the small bluff across the tiny creek
from the road. I said that it probably had already been checked and continued
rambling about Janet Queisser's shit list. The road ended, so we turned around.
On the way back, Dave insisted that we check out that obvious little cave
entrance. So, we stopped.
A few minutes later, we were talking to Mrs. Sibold, asking if we could dig
that hole open. She said no, but that she would ask her son and "the man on the
farm" if we could sometime in the future.
Two months later, Mike Fiore, Joe Uknalis, and I arrived at the cave, having
finally obtained permission to dig. Carrying the requisite fireplace implements,
shovel, Art-Deco boom box, and crow-bar to the entrance, Mike and I began to
dig to the lilting melody of "This Corrosion" by the Sisters of Mercy. Mike took a
break, examined the upper part of the rock crevice, turned visibly pale, and
returned to digging the lower part of the entrance. Joe then investigated the
upper part of the rock crevice, moved a rock, and slid into the cave. Five minutes
later, he came back with reports of formations, a stream, and walking passage.
Mike and I looked at the upper crevice again and continued to dig at the lower
and wider dirt-filled part of the entrance, this time with a sense of urgency. At
one point, Mike got tired, checked out the upper crevice yet again, and slid into
the cave, all the while cursing the "New-York crevice-crawling weenie" who had
preceded him. I attempted the crevice, backed out, and continued to dig while
Mike and Joe dug from the inside and incessantly gave reports of nice cave
passage beyond. Finally, I could take no more. I requested that Joe come back
out while I tried the upper crevice again. This time, I succeeded. The crevice is a
tight, horizontal, hour-glass shaped slot with ledges protruding from the sides, and
extends about eight feet to where another passage comes in and it gets wider.
You have to stay high to keep from wedging down and dying. Joe set the zero
datum on the rock at the entrance. Mike read Brunton. I started to sketch. "Stay
High" was the first comment on the sketch.
Mike Fiore: Jim neglects to mention the half-dozen or so poison-ivy vines
we cleared away from the crevice prior to digging, and the fact that, although Joe
and Jim are immune to the effects of poison-ivy, most of my right arm looked
