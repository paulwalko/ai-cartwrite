Keith Goggin continues to produce beautiful maps of caves in the area
code-named "Gogginland." If he finds more, we may have to rename it "Space
Mountain."
Equipment:
The new version of SMAPS has finally arrived to Giles County and has been
installed on Jim's 386 computer. Special sanity tip for cave mappers: don't
hand-crunch that survey data. 4.5 miles of Newberry-Banes Cave took only 10
minutes to calculate coordinates and adjust loops. Ísn't technology wonderful?
Old news and statistics:
Chuck Shorten's survey of Pig Hole put that cave over the 6000 ft. mark,
though we don't have the map or the official numbers.
Since the last Trog, GCCS has added (we'll call it) another mile and a
fraction to the Survey. My crystal ball sees much more in the near future.
