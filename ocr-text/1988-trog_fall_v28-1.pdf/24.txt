sustained orgasm of discovery was upon us, and I experienced the answer to the
question, "Why do I cave?"
Bright and early the following morning, we returned to the cave with more
rope and booty scoop lust. The drop from the balcony was 52' free. On the opposite
side of this lower trunk, we rappelled a very steep slope of 40' into a tall canyon 8
to 12' wide where we were soon met by a deep pool of water. Doug stripped and
swam across to confirm that the passage indeed continued. We spent the rest of the
day doing a quantitative evaluation of the significance of our find.
On that weekend, Doug and I had reached a point 266' below the entrance
and had seen nearly a mile of virgin cave with many leads. Three weeks later, VPI
Grotto and associates had the first mile of cave on paper. I led survey trips into the
cave for 9 of 11 weekends since discovery, and have led others on a more sporadic
basis since. The cave is currently 1.7 miles long 300 feet deep. The extremely
vertical nature of the cave has led to 775' of roped drops, but alas, it is slowing
down as I only have 48 little question marks left on the map.

From the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
The Encyclopedia Galactica says that caves are large orifices in the sides of
geographic features on a planet's surface, and also notes that some life forms have
a tendency to spend large amounts of time mucking about in them. The
Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy also mentions caves, saying that caves are fun to
muck about in and that the activity is a great excuse to get drunk.
The Guide also says that there are only three planets in the entire galaxy that
recognize caving as an activity.
On Aranies IV, the inhabitants spend most of their adult life throwing parties
and getting extremely drunk. Caving is the chosen form of execution for those who
refuse to participate. The condemned individual is sent down into a cave that has
two entrances and is told to find the other way out. As soon as the person enters the
cave, the entrance is sealed off. Usually, the person dies a horrible death by falling,
being crushed, freezing to death, or a combination of the above. Occasionally
however, one of them manages to find their way out to the other side. Most, after
their wizening experience, decide that they really need a drink after all and are
sucessfully reintegrated back into society,
On Blarnox IX and Earth, two wholly unremarkable planets on opposite sides
of the galaxy, caving is recognized as a wholly remarkable sport. Caving is one of
two sports in the whole galaxy where the sport itself is not the reason for
participating. In actuality, a person participates for the excuse to consume large
amounts of alcohol afterwards -- a truly wondrous concept.
The other sport in which this concept is applied is native to the planet Traal,
and involves the wrestling down and capturing of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of
Traal. However, since the Beast is never very cooperative and since the alcohol is
consumed prior to competing, no one ever really completes the event and it has not
become a very popular alternative to caving.
