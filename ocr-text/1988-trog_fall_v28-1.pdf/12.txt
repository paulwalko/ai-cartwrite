OBSERVED INJURIES: Jeff was found on his back. His left leg was folded
up behind him. Jeff was facing left; his head appeared to be resting on a rock (his
helmet was 8-10 feet away). Cause of death was listed as a major depressed skull
fracture in the left posterior area (approximately 2 fingers wide, 4-6 inches long).
His left pupil was blown. Jeff's left femur was partially torn away from his hip. His
left lower leg had a major open fracture. His left ear was severely torn.
POSSIBLE CAUSES OF THE ACCIDENT: Jeff wore tennis shoes which
may have made it difficult to keep 3 points of contact as he began to climb down to
the ledge. Jeff was doing a climb without a belay in a cave he had never been in
before. Apparently Jeff's helmet came off before he hit the bottom as it and the
lamp were found several feet away from Jeff. The chin strap on the MSA helmet
had come "unhooked" on the right side. The lamp bracket was also found to be
broken.
FINAL COMMENTS: The club did critique the rescue and noted several
things that could have been done better. It was the club's first body recovery in
their immediate caving area in over 20 years. I think we all learned a lot. There
are also some things that were noted that need to be worked out with the Giles Co.
Rescue Squad and their caving team. (A special thanks to Bundy for the numerous
pitchers of liquid refreshments provided after the rescue.).
THE VPI CAVE CLUB WISHES TO EXTEND OUR DEEPEST
SYMPATHY TO JEFF SNYDER'S FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

set up. Two lengths of sling held
the cam aloft, while a firmly an-
chored length of PMI provided the
main back-up strength. The haul-line
went over two changes of direction
over the pit (behind Doug) before go-
ing down to the Stokes.
