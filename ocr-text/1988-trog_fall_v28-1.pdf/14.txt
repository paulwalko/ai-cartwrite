Mr. Rugaber:
I would like to bring to your attention what we consider to be a very serious breach of
responsible journalism. On Tuesday, September 27, 1988, your paper published an article
about the death of a Virginia Tech student in a Giles County cave.
The reporter interviewed our Faculty Advisor, Jackie Redder, who requested that an exact
location of the cave not be printed. When the story was printed not only did it contain
nearly explicit directions to the locality of the cave, but had a map showing the area.
It is our policy to not give out the locations of caves, regardless of their popularity, for two
reasons. First, inexperienced, ill-prepared people will attempt to explore them, and hauling
the injured or dead bodies of these people out of a cave can be traumatic to all involved.
Second, a cave is a fragile environment which needs to be conserved (the reason that there
is a state law protecting caves). Had we been the original source of your information you
would not have had the location information at all.
The blatant refusal of the reporter and his editor to follow our request has angered us a
great deal. We feel that your paper could become indirectly responsible for further deaths
or violations of the cave law because of the publication of the cave location. We would like
to be able to continue our cooperation with your newspaper, however, the apparent
irresponsibility of the representatives of the Roanoke Times & World News makes this
difficult.
Signed,
Ben Keller,
