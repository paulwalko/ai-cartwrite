Ben's Famous Quote
"...and by going into the cave and examining the...the animals
there...its...people get a better understanding of what's going on with... [you know
with pollution."
[]- questionable.
That is what I heard one Friday night. I had started the night at Ton 80. Had
a good time. Went to the meeting. Heard this, and determined that it had to be
the beer that made it sound so bizarre. People did point it out as being bizarre, so
maybe it was. Well, at a later meeting it was written on the board and still sounded
bizarre, so I wrote it down later at Pedro's while eating and drinking. I thought I
would leave interpreting it to a time later when I could really grasp it. Well since
drinking seems to have to do with when I have heard it, and it almost seems that
Ben had been drinking when he said it (But it couldn't be because he had just been
caving with WSLS-TV) I will take a drink right now to help me understand it. Ha
Ha! Gulp! Ah! Bass Pale Ale!
On with it. Well since I am an engineering major (terribel at righting but
analytical) maybe I will try looking at it technically first like they tell us in technical
writing. Hmmm. We got a beginning thing, adjective of some sort I think,
confusing though because of "and" and "...its..." Ah, subject-People. Verb-get.
Hmm, well better go on a little, ah... Verb-understand. Ah..you know... People
understand pollution. Perfect sense. Well maybe the first part is important for
confusion. Examining animals in a cave... people understand pollution.. Complete
confusion.
Gulp!
Animals in a cave.. people understand pollution. Well that makes it sound
like animals are causing the pollution. Terribel animals. Wait a second, I was in
New River Cave, the worst polluted of them all. That cave had beer and soda cans.
I didn't think animals drank beer. Nah... I don't think they could even hold a beer
can in their hand, especially those critters (cave snails) that Jim and I got in
Tawney's. Gulp!
Hmm. Well I don't understand one thing right off. "People understand
caves", I interpreted. A lot of people don't understand caves. Matter of fact I
remember seeing somebody, actually two, in a cave that didn't understand the cave
well. They left behind beer cans and a mess which I don't want to talk about. Wait
a second that's pollution. I am on the right track. Ben is sensible. Gulp! Examining
animals. People cause pollution. People understand caves. Hmmm. Doesn't make
sense at all. First of all, I don't understand what animals has to do with beer cans
and pollution; they must hate it. Ah!!! I think we hit a key point here. Gulp!
"Hmmm lets find the connection. Ok. Think seriously. By examining the
animals.... who hate pollution.... [you know] people understand the cave better.
Wait a second that doesn't make any sense at all. Ummm..by examining the
animals who hate pollution, people get a better understanding of why pollution
is..[you know)..bad and why you shouldn't do it. Wait a second, his quote makes
perfect sense now to me; doesn't it to you. Gulp! Time to go to Ton 80!
