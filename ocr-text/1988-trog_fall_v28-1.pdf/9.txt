In the romance department, we have quite a few observations. Too many of
our members are got married this year. We lost Jackie Redder to Bob Hoell, in
an October 22 ceremony which Dougo attended in drag. That same day, Linda
Oxenreider was married to Randy Stoutenburg. Bob Alderson and Chris
Amundson are now married. Ed Devine married Linda Baker on December 3,
and the conspiring cavers arranged for seven of their wedding gifts to be toasters.
Becky Himmelmann is finally getting married to Jeff Harding after being engaged
for half her life.
Ed Fortney reportedly still has a girlfriend, although we never see her. Beth
Wichterman and Craig Roberts are back together in a long-distance relationship
(Georgia to Pennsylvania). Glen Davis has a main squeeze in Alice Lane, and we
rarely see him at meetings anymore. Paul Hess is still the club gigolo but business
appears to be slow--Paul had to scrimp to get his bike and car running again.
Babe magnet Jim Gamble occasionally has visitors. It has been noted that he has
broken his usual "babe" pattern and one (babe) has been spotted as many as three
times. Doug Bruce spends lots of time commuting to the "far east" to visit Laine
Buckwalter. At least he's not watching Donahue. Viola still spends her time
wondering who Mike Fiore has seduced lately. Leslie Colby broke up with her
yuppie boyfriend of 5 years, and immediately started seeing somebody named
Kevin. This is a definite step up, since unlike K-K-Ken, Kevin will go caving. And
Kay Johnson still won't admit that she's pregnant.
The club as a whole has changed little. Progress is underway to incorporate
ourselves to avoid liability problems. We will soon have to decide on a new name
for our club, since "VPI" is a Virginia Tech trade-mark. Jim Gamble has been
trying to organize a "decorate a tree with underwear" event to complete the
Animal House experience ("Every fall the trees are filled with underwear, every
spring the toilets explode.") It seems, however, that no one is willing to donate
underwear to the cause. Is this because cavers don't wear underwear (rather
likely), or because cavers don't spend money on new underwear, and the old stuff
is all stained or torn? (also rather likely). Nittany Grotto is trying to get a trainee
program started and will apparently use our own program as a model. Beth
Wichterman gets alot of credit for convincing these people of the need for such
programs.
Our international cavers are still active. Bob and Jean Simonds, and Walt
Pirie are going to Costa Rica over Christmas for a package caving trip. Jim
Gamble returned from an extensive ridge-walking trip in Europe this summer and
reported so many entrances in Belgium that the locals cover these annoyances
with chicken wire and boards. As usual, there is a trip planned to Mexico this
Christmas.
And what about the trainee scum? There is little mention of them because
they have been keeping their private lives to themselves. This has to stop! Is life
that dull? What we do know is that Wendy. Wickham has become the little sister
at a (yuck) frat. Brian Cruikshank shows promise of replacing Beth Wichterman
as a quotable quotes source (although no one could ever do as well as Beth.)
Trainees, remember: you aren't really a member of the club until you've been
abused in the "grapevine"!
