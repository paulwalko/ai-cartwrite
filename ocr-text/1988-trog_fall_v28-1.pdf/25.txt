Hot Lead in Hick's Cave
Hicks Cave is a flood overflow route for the Hidden River Complex in Hart
County, Kentucky. Hidden River itself is a large underground river which was once
a well-known tourist attraction but is now too polluted to enter. It is only a few
miles from Horse Cave, and runs from Rowlette and I-65 to four spring entrances
on the Green River. It is a sinkhole-plain cave, framed on two sides by Fischer
Ridge and Roppel. The Bluegrass Grotto's Sept. 10 survey trip added more than a
thousand feet, nudging the cave's surveyed length over 20 miles. (Joan Johnson .
was along on that 12 hour trip.)
The natural spring entrances to Hicks are all at the river's edge, and too near
the water level for comfort. After several near flood-ins since exploration began in
1975, Bluegrass Grotto and friends began a final push to find a high, dry natural
entrance, and failed. With the help of Frank Reid (Bloomington, IN) and his radio,
they located a suitable dome-pit into which they could blast an all-weather
entrance. The hole was completed in 1978-79 and a luxuriously equipped 40-foot
piece of culvert was installed in 1985. (see The Kentucky Caver, Feb. 1988)
So on Oct. 8, 1988, our party could simply rappel 80 feet into dome J-336
rather than donning wetsuits and spending six or seven hours getting to our
survey-of-the-day. There were four people in our crew: Tom Ahlers (from
Lafayette, IN), Duke Hopper, Larry Peterson, and myself (all Bluegrass). We were
all psyched for a long trip, and planned on getting some mud, slime and water
samples in the ongoing battle to trace the myriad sources of pollution in the area.
If that wasn't enough, there was plenty of unsurveyed upper level passage in Hicks!
Our first mission of science was up in the Q-Survey. About halfway between
its junctions with the J- and R-Surveys, there is a small (20 foot tops) vertical shaft
which has black slime oozing in from above. What is truly disgusting is that only
ten feet from the slime pit are some very pretty translucent orange soda straws. The
formations and the whole ceiling are covered with a fine, hairy layer of clear
crystals. Another 100 feet from the slime are dozens of cave pearls. I took my time
sampling the red background mud, and muttered a suitable number of ooohs and
aaahs.
We took the R-Survey shortcut, a 500 foot crawlway/stoopway, and popped
out near the bottom of J-280, a 40-foot dome. We changed carbide and filled our
water tanks from the flowing drips. The next mission was to collect water from the
bottom of a slump pit in the J-Survey near J-247. This particular lead was noticed
this past Memorial Day, having been filled with water until this summer's drought.
It is one of the few unchecked low leads in the cave and is one of the last hopes for
a connection with Hidden River. It certainly smells like the malodorous Horse
Cave end of the river. The pit is basically a 4- to 5-foot drain hole punched through
the mud floor of the J-Survey. A narrow hands-and-knees crawlway branches off
from the bottom of the hole. Two or three times this summer, people had hopped
into the hole and started into the crawlway, only to find breathing difficult and to
see their lamps flaring and dying. We weren't planning on testing our ability to
breathe CO2--we just wanted to grab a little water from the bottom of the pit itself.
Our group arrived in the slump pit room (about 3â€™H by 10'W) and settled
down to eat while Duke took samples. Tom handed him the jars and went to sit
down. Duke made a few wisecracks and turned toward the edge of the hole. A
dancing blue genie of flame the size of a beach ball appeared in front of his head,
and I yelled, "Shit, let's get out!" as I started running. Larry saw me take off and
followed. I had a moment of doubt, embarrassed that I might be running only
because Duke's lamp base had cracked, when I heard a rumble like a train going by
on the surface. Oh God, there's someone burning back there!
