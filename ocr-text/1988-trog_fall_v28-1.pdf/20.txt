GCCS Update: All the GCCS That’s Fit to Print
· [The Wizard's Column]
Since the last Trog, GCCS has continued progress toward its ultimate goal of
re-cataloging the caves of Giles County.
Just say yes:
The summer began with the opening of Stay High Cave (see article elsewhere
in this issue), which kept the local folks busy all summer while the students were
away. So far, the survey has over 5000 ft. of length and 240 ft. of depth.
Wilburrrn valley:
Surveys also continued in Mike Futrell's (grim] Wilburn Valley Project--Yer
Cave now has about 9000 ft. of (grim) passage, and Price's Strike Cave (1800 ft.) is
said to be done (OK, maybe one more [grim) trip).
Good news about New River Cave:
The New River Cave map reportedly is back in production. Jean Simonds
showed Dale Parrot the Virginia Cellars article that hinted that the map would be
of poor quality should it ever be drawn. That and the "verbizing" of his name (if
someone surveys a cave and absconds with the notes without drawing the map,
local usage has it that he has "parrotted" the map) may have shamed Dale into
reviving the project.
GCCS wishes Dale the best of luck--we will probably owe him a party or two.
Should all of this not work, however, Lawrence Britt has volunteered to head-up a
new survey.
More news on New River Cave:
For Sale. With about 40 acres and some river-front property. Will not be
listed in Better Caves and Sinkholes. See local realtors in Blacksburg and Radford
for a tour.
Holes, more or less:
Now and again we are reminded that karst changes. Andrews Cave is no
longer with us--a victim of being filled in, either by storms or the Highway
Department. Ridgewalking has turned up another eight or so to replace it--six on
"Walkers Creek" and two near Pig Hole. We're not sure whether any of the Walker
Creek six were previously recorded--the Thierry data on this area is pretty
nebulous. (I almost said "sketchy", but that much better describes the notes we
took.) That afternoon, Mike Fiore and Frank Kadel surveyed two recorded caves:
Meadie Tabor's Water Cave and Dewey Reynolds Cave, while Brian, John, Wendy,
Scott, someone else (sorry),and Jim found six and sketched two on a Fortney-style
Death March.
The two caves near Pig Hole were found by Brian, Scott, and Jim before
mapping Echols Cave (see Scott's article elsewhere in this issue.) One of them is a
promising dig. The other one isn't. Special safety tip for larger cavers: make sure
someone smaller than you is both ahead of you and behind you when negotiating
squeezes. The long wait for a rescue you save may be your own.
Third party contracts:
Straley's Cave #2 has reportedly been surveyed as part of Dave Hubbard's
Saltpeter Cave Project. I have suggested that the same people re-survey #1 and
put them both on the same map for an aesthetically pleasing Salon entry.
