In the jobs/accomplishments department, lots of activity as always: Jo Zo got
his MBA. Ko Tak also got his master's earlier this semester. Richard Cobb got a
real job, since there is little demand for female impersonations around here.
David Cinsavich quit "the O-team" at Olver, and Kay Johnson is now working full
time at the library. If you happen to be in a state park near Petersburg, resist the
temptation to molest any bunnies or squirrels unless you dare face the new Park
naturalist, Hugh Beard. Ben Keller and Jackie Hoell have both been interviewed
by Campus Voice and should appear in print sometime in March. Steve
Lancaster is reportedly yachting in California, to the amazement of all who knew
him. Dave Shantz will be promoting VPI with his outstanding performance as a
lineman in a video that Tech is distributing world-wide. Tom Bank is co-oping in
Pennsylvania with an architecture firm, and appearing at special yearly events.
And where is Doug Abernathy these days? Garrie Rouse has disappeared since
his marriage, to the relief of those who were usually corralled into his infamous
Stomp Bottom survey trips.
Doug Bruce is now unemployed over 100% of his body, and is considering
student life once again. Dougo is now tattooed over 5% of his body, which
equates to $80 of self-improvement. It is notable that Philip Balister has done
nothing of note since the last "grapevine" publication. Perhaps he is wondering
how to surpass the notoriety the one achieves from destroying a toilet with a
single bottle-rocket. The word is that he has a new job of some sort, but we have
no details. Jeff Jablonski now has a job doing work with/for the Marines. John
Lohner is still looking for work in Colorado. We still hear from Wyoming
occasionally via Jenny Ford who is in Laramie, Jean Hartman has moved to
Bridgewater, Va. and now works for the college there. The college is run by the
Church of the Brethren, and must be quite a culture-shock. Our resident child
psychologist, Mike Fiore, will be in print in one of those fancy research magazines
before too long. He recently had an article accepted. The Dawson's have moved
to Wisconsin, leaving most of their pets behind. Jim G. now owns Spud, their
somewhat rotund cat. Jim G. has also arranged his schedule so that he will won't
graduate before December of next year. (This is in keeping with the Philip B.
take-your-time philosophy.) One final dubious achievement belongs to Doug
Perkins, for receiving a missive from the infamous Rev. Ewing.
The annual Halloween party was well attended by current and alumni cavers.
Mike Fiore did a great job organizing and decorating, although he was
conspicuously absent the following morning when it was time to clean-up. There
was no excuse for this since he had only two dates this time. Those not involved in
party preparations must have spent alot of time in costume preparation, as there
were some really outstanding costumes there. Ed F. came as a slice of pizza and
was recognized for the most edible costume. Jim W. as the wizard of Ä CCS won
a prize for the best last-minute costume (amazing what you can do with curtains
and canvas-grip.) Robbie French,a trainee, won the safest costume award, as a
condomaximum. A guest of Joan Hederick came undressed as a Playboy "woman
of the major leagues" and was very popular with the men. Gabi came as a nymph
complemented by Kat as a satyr. The best impersonation award went to Jerry
Redder for his "Dougo" costume. The most realistic costume prize went to Suki,
for coming as a dog.
And what naughtiness occurred that Halloween? There was a
massage-a-thon upstairs involving Berta Kirchman, Hugh Beard, Dave Cinsavich,
and Loretta Bush, Barry Fizer entertained all night on the piano. Craig
Ferguson, dressed as King Tut, recovered from a state of near catatonia in time to
leave with two nubile maidens. Much interest was shown in Jim Gamble's purity.
Proudly claimed as 99.75% pure by a tag on his chest, Jim found the many
watchdogs of purity just waiting for a chance to cross out the existing score, and
write a lower score in its place. Especially costly was coming too near the Playboy
"woman of the major leagues". In the end, those arbitrary deductions, are
probably inaccurate and his purity will require another measurement with the
offical Mike Fiore test.
