rigged into Hess's Hollow. Joe and Mike Futrell rappelled down to Jeff. Being a
trained EMT, Joe took vital signs. There was no pulse and no respirations, and the
pupils were fixed and dilated. Jeff's body was cool to the touch but warmer than the
cave temperature. It was now a body retrieval instead of a cave rescue. Unaware
of where the outside command post was going to be set up, Carol sent Mike Fiore
out the pit entrance and Dave out the back entrance with the information about
Jeff. Rex followed Dave out.
The question of moving the body, with the local medical examiner's
permission, came up. While waiting for the medical examiner's response, two
teams were sent inside the cave. One team went down the pit to start the stokes in
and to rig the drop above the Mud Bridge. Another team went in the back
entrance with a stethescope and blanket. A third team stayed on the outside to rig
the entrance with a high line.
Joe and Mike Futrell verified by stethescope that Jeff had no heart beat. The
information was relayed outside about the time the medical examiner made contact
with the rescue (3:15pm). Permission to move the body was given.
At this point it became evident that the people of Giles Co. Rescue who were
in charge were not sure of how to run things. Working with the squad, I set up a
command post at the pit entrance. At approximately 4:00pm, I contacted Kay and
asked her to send more people including those at the Cave Board meeting. (Sent
were Phillip Ballister, Ko Takamizawa, Don Anderson, Jean Simonds, Sally
Pearson, Ernst Kastning, Dave Cinsavitch, and Buddy Bundy.
By 5:00pm the high line had been rigged and tested. The underground
coordinator (Carol) asked for the stretcher team, since Hess's Hollow and the
climb above the Mud Bridge had been rigged. A team was assembled and sent in.
The weather had been miserable that day. Almost all of the cavers had gone
in soaked from rain. Although it wasn't a long distance to the pit, there were only
14 people available to carry the stokes. Word was sent from the command post to
Kay to call out Blue Ridge Grotto (at approximately 5:30pm).
Knox had rappelled down to Joe and Mike Futrell to help Joe load and
package Jeff into the stokes. Mike Futrell climbed out of Hess's Hollow to help rig
the drop to bring the stokes out.
Between 6:00 and 6:30pm the stokes was moved from the bottom of Hess's
Hollow to the top of the climb above the Mud Bridge. The stretcher crew (which
included the 2 rescue squad members who suddenly rematerialized) started the
stokes's journey to the pit entrance. The initial response team and the rigging team
exited the cave by the back entrance at this time. At 7:35pm the stokes was at the
bottom of the pit entrance. There was a short delay while the cavers who rigged
the high line and were on the stretcher crew climbed out.
With the help of Blue Ridge Grotto, the landowner, and the few cavers at the
top, the stokes began to be hauled up the 130 foot drop at 8:15pm. The stokes was
on the surface at 8:30pm. Jeff's body arrived at Giles Memorial Hospital about
9:15pm. Positive ID was made by a roommate around 10:00pm. His mother and
girlfriend were notified around 10:45pm. Rescue operations at the cave were
cleaned up by 10:30pm.
