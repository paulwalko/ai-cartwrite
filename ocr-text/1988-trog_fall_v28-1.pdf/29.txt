That was fun. Instantly seeing where we had mapped in relation to the rest of
the cave. We had come thirteen feet below the entrance and 120 feet away. Jim
predicts pretty close to the surface. The passage kept going after our last station,
and was probably squeezable. We even saw animal droppings. I was too tired at
the time to press for more passage but maybe it ended at animal hole, was diggable,
or was another entrance? Oh well, maybe next time I will get to go further down
into the earth, and do something that leads somewhere even more interesting...

How to Feel Stupid When Climbing Up Rope
Take it from someone with experience, it is no problem. All you have to do is
screw up everything you were taught to do when climbing -- you know, forget your
calls, tie the wrong knots, tie the right knots backwards, and last but not least,
forget to put your gloves on. If that does not work, try climbing so slowly and
awkwardly that everyone below you beats you to the top by using the other rope.
On a trainee trip to Clover Hollow I'had a good old time learning what a big
difference climbing out of the Canyon room was from climbing up the Ag.E bridge.
First, I tied all three of my helical knots so badly that "Captain" Ed, our trip leader,
could not fogure out what the hell I had done wrong. I spent the next fifteen
minutes untieing and retieing the knots only to discover that I had tied them wrong
again. I was getting pissed. Ed, of course, had to reteach me how to get them right.
Boy, I felt stupid, but I did get tied to the rope after a half hour of instruction.
Just before I started climbing, I looked up the rock face and thought, "That's
not too far --I'll make it up in no time." Dead wrong. I was looking at only the first
lip of the ledge and the distance looked a lot shorter than it really was. Anyway, I
started climbing up the rope the hard way; pushing one knot up at a time... right
foot, left foot... standing up, pushing up the seat knot. This included rest stops
every ten feet. Once I reached the lip of the ledge, I realized that it did not end
here, but some fifty feet higher up. The next problem was that the rest of the climb
was against the rock face.
At about this time, Leslie, the blond spider, was starting to climb up the other
rope faster than me. I began to hurry a little, only to bang my carbide lamp against
another jutting ledge. Leslie had almost caught up to me at about the same time I
was getting tired of banging into the small ledges the rock wall abounds with. Then
an idea hit me -- why not walk up the wall? I mentally kicked myself for not
thinking of this before. I tried to make the climb up a little eaiser by stepping on
the small ledges and protruding rocks (Ed. note --I'm getting Dave Colatosti
flashbacks...) but to no use. I kept forgetting to put my weight on the knots
instead of the wall. With only twenty feet to the top, Leslie passed me and reached
the top just before I did.
Only one obstacle left -- a smooth, slippery incline that I kept sliding down on
my stomach each time I tried to cross. After five minutes of futile struggling, I
managed to wedge a knee hold and slowly climb up the incline one knee after
another. When I finally managed to get off of the rope, I started to remember
everything I was supposed to do -- the proper ways to tie knots, climb, and get over
ledges. At that moment, I had a great urge to repeatedly knock ny head against a
walÄ«. At least it is over with for now, I hope.
P.S. If you would like lessons on doing things the hard way, do not hesisitate
to get in touch with me.
