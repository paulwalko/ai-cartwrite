gangrenous for a week afterwards.
Once in the cave, we immediately noticed two small passages going off to
the left, with a trickle stream coming out of the lower one. Sure enough, the
passages looped together for a total length of about 60'. We surveyed as quickly as
accuracy allowed, following the stream for a snug but comfortable 160 or so. We
came out above a 10' waterfall, looking out over a very impressive room that
boomed steeply downward, out of the range of our lamps. From our vantage
point, two waterfalls and what seemed to be a pit could be seen down through the
mist. I fought an urge to dash right off into the void long enough to rig the survey
party's only piece of sling to a large chunk of breakdown, and "batman" down the
first waterfall while Jim finished sketching. After a few weird moves of
questionable safety in order to keep dry, I got to the bottom, only to see another
waterfall 12' further on. It became obvious we were going to need real vertical
gear when I saw the end of the sling dangling about l' over the edge of the second
waterfall. The room still stretched out as far as I could see. I "batmanned" back
up to Jim and Joe, and got refreshingly soaked on the way up. We were all pretty
ragged out from the entrance ordeal, and with tears in our eyes, left for the
entrance without ever seeing the far end of the room. Solemn indeed were our
oaths to return, soon, and with proper equipment.
The very next week, the three of us were again staring at that miserable slot
that passed for an entrance. We had brought enough gear to tackle Lechuguilla,
and had left the boom-box at home. Starting from the top of the first waterfall at
the north end, we rigged a 150', and rapelled/staggered/surveyed our way down
through the room. From north to south, the room had a 10' waterfall, 12' of
stream, a 15' waterfall, a small, really abrasive crevice with loads of loose rock
going down low and taking the stream, a 10' shelf, and an 18' rappel. The dip of
the room was about 30 degrees. By the time we reached the south end of the
room, we had each been on and off rope at least three times, and decided to
ignore the alcove and 20' pit at the southwest corner of the room in favor of
horizontal passage going south. In a few shots it turned into a disgusting crawlway
decorated with piles of "extruded organic matter" and some of the most
lethal-looking fungus I have ever seen. Going back into the main room, we set a
much-needed change of direction bolt above the last 20' pit and rappelled down
on the tail-end of the 150' that had taken us this far.
Jim Washington: Needless to say, the cave opened up from there, and we
found ourselves with an eight-hundred-foot virgin cave that had several going
leads after that second trip on May 15. Virginia Tech's exam schedule prevented
surveying trips for another two weeks, then summer break sorely reduced the size
of the Club. Cecile James, Ko Takamizawa, and I were the next crew in, on June
From the bottom of the last pit, the cave descends steeply southward in a
high, narrow canyon stream passage. It turns left, then right down a slimy
eight-foot waterfall, then south again in a high, wide canyon. The stream that had
reappeared at the bottom of the last pit sinks here. A hundred feet further, a
second stream appears from the south and sinks in ten feet. After another jog, the
passage terminates in a low, wide room with several leads. Joe, Mike, and I had
surveyed the right-hand lead in Links Cave-like mazy canyons through the Walnut
Room (named for the walnut hulls strewn about the floor) to a crevice that
screams, "Don't dig here. I will drop tons of boulders.on you and you will not like
it!" Cecile, Ko, and I were going to look at the straight-ahead lead and the
