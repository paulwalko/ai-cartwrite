Dear Mr. Keller:
Walter Rugaber has asked me to respond to your letter of Sept. 30,
1988 in which you criticize the newspaper for stories written after the
death of a Virginia Tech student in a Giles County cave.
We appreciate your policy of not giving out the locations of caves in
an effort to keep ill-prepared people from exploring them. In printing a
map of the approximate location of the cave and giving a general location
of the cave in our story, we did not intend to give directions to
ill-prepared explorers. We intended to inform our readers about the
location of a news event.
You have a duty to promote the safe exploration of caves while we have
a duty to inform the public about newsworthy events in Southwest Virginia.
Our general description of the location of the cave was an effort to do
that, nothing more.
The ''where'' of a story is an important element, and could even serve
to show the danger of this particular cave to ill-equipped people who
might decide to go exploring.
Nonetheless, we understand your position and are sensitive to your
concerns. I think our decision to use a general location is an example of
that.
Thank you for writing to express your concern.
Åžincerely,
