Limerick Contest Results and Submissions
submitted by a bunch of no-talent ass clowns
FIRST PLACE BY CHRIS MICHIE:
A long Clover Hollow trip I foresee,
Kirk's rigging test, Oh woe is me.
Won't heed Mike's advice,
And failed his knots thrice,
And is still called a voting trainee!
There once was an editor Eileen
whose Trog pleas got annoying and mean.
She'd bug old and new member
a simple article to send 'er
we'll be glad when she's no longer seen.
- Eileen O'Malley
SECOND PLACE BY KATHERINE FERGUSON:
Down in a cave dark and deep,
Where good ol' A.I. goes to sleep
There's crickets and spiders
And cavers and hiders
Yes, down underground they creep.
Someone suggested that a Frog is the way to go
They said my ropewalker was starting to blow
But to be associated with the French
I wouldn't, even in a pinch
You won't find me in one of those silly
contraptions below!
- Craig Ferguson
RUNNER UP BY SANDY KNAPP
Everyone must sign OUT.
If you're late and we find you're about,
It would please us to tease,
And string you up by your knees,
And then you must buy us some stout.
A usenet abuser named Hoyt
Would troll 'til he got in a fight
He'd lose, then lose patience
And post cave locations
To prove to the world he was right.
- Name Withheld by Request
THE REST
When you find a pit just throw down a pad
The fancy gear is merely a fad
To go the trouble of re-belay
Causes much delay
When there is so much more cave to be had!
- Craig Ferguson
There once was a girl named Eileen
Who had a great cave in between
Her legs. They were white
'Cause they hadn't seen light
But still, they were the best that I've seen!
- Katherine Ferguson
If in water you have no fear,
And being naked is not a care,
Then Smokehole is the name,
And if you'd like to play her game,
Then come one, come all... if you dare.
- Sandy Knapp
There once were two men named Steve,
So close, who could believe,
They'd play all night,
With nary a fight,
Who could believe they didn't conceive.
- Sandy Knapp
