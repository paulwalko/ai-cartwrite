Practice Rescue
by Kathy Despain
The practice rescue for this Fall 2002 semester
was held on Saturday, November 9, at 10 A.M.
Only having been with the club since Picnic in
the spring of 2002, I had no idea what to expect
in the practice rescue. I figured that since
caving can be a dangerous activity I might as
well learn how a rescue is handled. On the
morning of November 9, I arrived a few
minutes after 10 A.M. at the Bat Ranch, and the
program and activities for the day had not yet
started. Matt Burnett, the man in charge of the
practice rescue, was waiting for any stragglers
such as myself to arrive before beginning. The
program actually began around 10:30 A.M.
The basic outline of the day was as follows:
10AM-LUNCH:
Information Sections:
Matt Burnett – Callout
Ed Fortney – Rescue Gear
Ray Sira – Initial Response Team
Philip Balister - Communications
Karen Everhart – Basic Medical
Steve Wells & Steve LePera - Rigging
AFTER LUNCH:
Underground practice with Mike Cole teaching
patient packaging, and patient transport
THE PRACTICE RESCUE
Matt Burnett talked about callout, which is the
method in which people are called to a rescue
situation. The VPI Cave Club provides a
Rescue Roster card, with names and phone
numbers of the people who should be called in
the case of a rescue. This card should be carried
to any cave trip and placed somewhere visible
on the surface while in you are in the cave. The
names on the card are in the order that they
should be called. If the first person, Zenah
Orndorff is not there, then the next person,
Jerry Redder, should be called, and this should
be followed until someone is reached. (This
order that I am going off of is from the latest
issued card, 2001.) Once you have gotten in
touch with someone on the card, the callout
begins. Active cavers, member or not, can be
called. If called, you will be either put on
standby or asked to go to the rescue.
Ed Fortney went over the rescue gear that the
VPI Cave Club owns. He explained the use of
the stokes (the item that the patient is carried
out of the cave during a rescue) and the bag of
gear that should always accompany the stokes.
In that bag there are many wool blankets to
keep the patient warm. There is also a lot of
webbing in various lengths to attach the patient
to the stokes. Ed also went over the first aid
kits, and the other various gear that could be
important and useful during a rescue. In the
process of going over the gear, a couple of
items were seen that needed to be replaced for
the club gear. These items were noted.
Ray Sira spoke on the Initial Response Team,
also known as the Bash Team. This team in a
cave rescue is the first group of people in a
cave. If possible it consists of some of the most
experienced people in cave rescue. Because
they are in charge of making the initial patient
diagnosis, this team carries the initial response
kit. This kit contains items that can be useful in
an emergency. It is essential that this group
have good communication with the subsequent
cavers that arrive to the rescue site.
Philip Balister spoke on the importance of
communication and the ways of
communication during a cave rescue.
Communication is very important in a cave
rescue. The status of the patient, the progress
of the rigging, whether more help is needed,
and many more topics are important in the
rescue. Without appropriate communication,
mistakes can and probably will be made that
could be detrimental to the patient as well as
everyone involved in the rescue.
There are many forms of communication in a
cave rescue. Outside of the cave, cell phones
and walkie-talkies can be valuable, although at
many of the cave locations around the area cell
phone reception is not necessarily reliable. In
