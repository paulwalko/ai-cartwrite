Nikky's Bridge Day Adventure
by Nikky LaBranche
Bridge Day is an event to celebrate the New
River Gorge Bridge, which at three thousand
and thirty feet is the longest span arch bridge.
On the third Saturday in October, the bridge is
closed to traffic to host West Virginia's largest
one day festival. The public is welcomed to
walk the bridge and watch the BASE jumpers
and rappellers. The BASE jumpers have a
platform set up on top of the bridge from
which they jump. The rappellers use the
catwalk underneath the bridge to rig into for
the eight hundred and seventy six foot drop.
Brad and I were with the Flittermouse team
lead by Scott McCrea. The team consisted of
Scott, Frank Abbato, Brad Atkinson, Al
Hughes, Dave Lambe, Mark Stover, Patrick
O’Diam, Don Going, and Robert and Kevin
Quick. I served as rope tender, belay, and
picture taker.
Bridge Day started very early. It was the five
A.M. type of early (four A.M. if you count the car
alarm from somewhere in the campsite). We
quickly got dressed and packed our gear for the
day, then we all piled into the car. We left the
airport where we were camped to head over to
the campground where the ATF was
headquartered, and all the Bridge Day activity
was taking place.
I had been told when I got there at around 1:00
that morning that they were making me the
belay team and sending me to the bottom. So
while the guys ate breakfast, Brad and I tried to
find me a ride down to the bottom of the drop.
We talked to Tiny from BATS Grotto and he
assured me, “We always have room for a pretty
girl.” So I climbed into the back of the truck
with the other nine people from BATS and
various other places. We were quite cozy. As
I left I saw the rappellers all lined up getting
inspected by the bomb-sniffing canines. We
drove down the small one lane windy road with
several switchbacks to get to the bottom. As
usual, my stomach didn't agree with the West
Virginia roads and I was very queasy by the
time I got out of the truck.
When we got to the belay site we still had an
hour until they started dropping the ropes, so
we sat around and talked for a while. It was a
rather chilly day with a good bit of wind. Then
I got the call, “Top 4 to Bottom 4, we're
starting to lower the rope,” and with that I was
off to try and guess where our rope would land.
That turned out to be ten feet down the steep
hill from where I wanted it to land. So I got to
walk around to the bottom of the hill and find
it again and then climb back up the hill with it,
trying to use the rope to help me up the steep
hill. With some effort I got the rope back up to
level ground and out of both trees. The next
challenge was to find a second person with gear
to help me do the pull test. The amount of wind
that day made it hard to pull the rope straight
down and most of them bowed noticeably with
the wind. After that was taken care of, it was
time to sit and wait for the first rappeller.
A little while later I got the call, “Top 4 to
Bottom 4, rappeller on rope.” And after about
seven minutes there was Kevin, with his feet on
the ground again, still on the adrenaline rush.
Brad was the third one on rope and loved every.
minute of it. It took him about eight to nine
minutes to complete the first drop. He came
off the rope with a big smile on his face. It was
really neat to see the twenty-two ropes in a line
with people in different positions on every one.
Several people also decided to climb ropes
during the day as well. I even saw a mother and
daughter team. The guys took over the belay
duties from me and I was free to go relax and
socialize. Brad and the other first few
rappellers headed back up to the top to rappel
again.
I also watched the BASE jumpers for a while.
One of them got under the bridge and brushed
against two of the ropes. They were neat to
watch from the ground. There were even a
couple who got off course and landed close to
the belay site. We had a few instances of people
dropping things from the bridge. There were
two water bottles and a piece of wood. Objects
falling from the bridge can reach terminal
