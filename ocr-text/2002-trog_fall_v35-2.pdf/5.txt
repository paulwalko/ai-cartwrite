velocity and their impacts can be very
dangerous or even deadly if they hit you right.
Most of us were wearing helmets but we all
tried to get out the way when these objects hit.
I had wandered over towards the railroad tracks
socializing when I looked up above the tree line
to see an out of control rappeller hit the ground
on the other side of the tracks with a thud.
There were EMT's close by as well one who
was on the BATS belay team. Within fifteen
minutes they had him out of there and on his
way to the trauma center in Charleston. It made
me stop and think about the dangers involved
in an eight hundred and seventy six foot rappel.
At that point we thought he had probably
broken his tail bone and possibly punctured or
bruised a few internal organs. The belayer did
manage to get him off center enough so he
missed the big rock. And just a few minutes
after the fall, our next rappeller, Brad, got on
rope for his second rappel.
Brad took between four and five minutes to get
down the rope this time, going much faster
than he had before. This did worry me some
after what I had just witnessed. After Brad got
down safely we waited around for two more to
come down the rope to take over belay duties.
Then Brad, Al Hughes, and I got on the bus to
head up to the top of the bridge. The bus was
packed with mostly BASE jumpers and a few
rappellers. There was an armed female guard at
the door of the bus for safety reasons. Brad and
I stopped on the bridge to look at the view of
the BASE jumpers. They are the real crazy
people who jump the eight hundred and
seventy six feet and trust that their parachute
will open. I noticed it was much colder and
windier on the bridge than it was down below
at the belay site. There was a good size crowd
of people gathered on the bridge watching.
There was one who looked at our gear and
asked us if we were jumping or climbing. We
took the none of the above option and
explained to him about the rappelling gear we
had on.
After about ten minutes on the bridge, I got
bored and went back to find the car and meet
up with Al who was making coffee. Al told me
stories about his younger days when he was in
the Army while we waited for the others to get
back to camp. When everyone got back it was
time to break into the adult beverages. The
rappellers had to be cleared out by three
o'clock, but no one could go anywhere because
the bridge was closed to traffic until five P.M.
So it was social hour at the ATF campsite.
The team decided to go to Dirty Ernie's Rib Pit
for dinner. Apparently we weren't the only
ones with that idea and we had to wait for a
table. We went through almost two buckets of
peanuts between the nine of us while we
waited. The food was great, and I was very
thankful for something besides the Rice
Krispies Treats I had for breakfast and lunch.
Then we took a trip to the grocery store and
headed back to camp at the airport for a night
of celebrating.
