Did you see that cutie named Jen?
Coolest trainee that's ever been,
Hardly been horizontal,
With the club, consonantal,
And chugs beer with the best of the men!

Our beloved guitarist named Kirk,
Drinking beer by the fire with a smirk,
Some call him a troll
Burping over the knoll
But Pam is just thrilled he has work!

There once was a caver named Ray
Who had a big pole so the say
When you find your new goal
is to reach a high hole
He will use it to save the day

Wil thinks himself a bard,
but his words we disregard.
He's dumb as a brick
and has a short dick,
So that's why he's called “The Bastard.”

One Picnic there was Kochiro,
Who liked to fly in the airo,
So he hopped on his bike,
And took to flight,
And since then he's been our hero.

There once was a girl name Eileenie,
Whose boyfriend sure was a meanie,
She liked her port,
. And while SHE may be short,
Her boyfriend's weenie is tiny.

Let's not forget Stay High, a cave
discovered by Jim and by Dave.
If you're small you can sneak
thru the lower route's peek
but if not, just stay high and be brave.
(Or it's your stuck butt we must save!)

In our club was a caver named Sandy
whose brain was pure cotton candy.
Every sentence she used
make her friends stare, confused,
but to mock her's so easy it's handy!
- Eileen O'Malley
Steve was a man with a truck,
a Bronco dead like a duck.
He's worked like hell
and now it looks swell,
so soon the thing will be stuck.
- Steve LePera
And then there's our club email list
which caused lots of missing the gist.
People tried to bring order
make the fighting posts shorter
to prevent it from coming to fists.
- Eileen O'Malley
There once was a zealous trainee,
Who drank nearly a liter of Chablis.
As the group lazily napped,
Watching the miners, entrapped,
They all heard him puke on the tree!
