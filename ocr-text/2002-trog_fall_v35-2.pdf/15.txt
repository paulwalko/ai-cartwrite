Caving, Shmaving!
reprinted from the listserv posting of Mike Newsome
Hi -
I am Cypress Marie Ambrose, and I'm the new
e new
daughter of Mike Newsome and Molly Lucier.
I am writing to tell you about my “caving”
experience.
Well, it's like this... I'm just hanging out in a
nice, comfortable, dark chamber. I'm having a
good time, just relaxing and listening to the
sounds. All of a sudden, people start telling me
that I'm soon going to have to go out through
a LITTLE passage. Well, I took one look at the
hole they wanted me to go through, and I said
"no way!”
People started insisting that I put my face down
there so that I can go through head first. Well.
Maybe my brother Birch was willing to do that,
but I wasn't going to stick MY face down there!
So, I turned
around and stuck
my feet in the
"passage. This
got everyone
upset. “It's too
tight to go
through feet
first!” So, they got
some guy to try
and force me to
turn around.
Fortunately, I was
able to jam my
head under a ledge
(they called it
“Molly's rib
cage") and I
stiffened up as much as I could to jam myself
into place. It worked! They tried and tried to
into place. It wor
make me turn around, but I held out! I told
them, “If I can't go through feet first, I'm not
going!” This got everyone even more upset...
“She has to come out!”... “She can't do it feet
first!”... “What are we going to do?” I told them
“You can do anything you want, but I'm NOT
putting my head through that little opening!"
So, they called in some experts, and made an
artificial entrance. They pulled me out with no
problem. Feet first, just like I planned. I knew
that if I held out long enough, they'd have to do
it my way!
All this happened on Friday, June 21, 2002.
After they got me out, they took some
measurements, and I weighed 8 pounds, 15
ounces, and I was 20.5 inches long.
It's kind of bright and
cold out here, but I
think it's going to be
fun.

a quick search for
"cypress.” I hope to
see you all soon!
