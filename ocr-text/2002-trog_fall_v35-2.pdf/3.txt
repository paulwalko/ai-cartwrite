And Now a Word from our Editor
by Eileen O'Malley
Well it's been a fun few years, but my retirement is probably long overdue. So here it is! I hereby.
retire as Trog Editor.
I've had a great time editing the Trog, and I hope the next editor loves this job as much as I have.
I hope I wasn't too much of a pain - no, wait, that's not true. I enjoyed being a pain as much as
the rest of it.
Anyway, I'd like to leave you all with one last thought:
