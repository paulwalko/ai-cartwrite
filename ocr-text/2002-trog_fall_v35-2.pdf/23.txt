A BIT OF HISTORY
According to VAR records, in January of 1944,
the grotto began publication of a newsletter
called the Grotto Grapevine. This contained
articles on speleoscience, trip reports,
personality sketches of various members, and
good-natured mudslinging. The more things
change....
THE CLUB BRINGS 1T8 HEAD OUT OF THE BAND (BRIEFLY)
This year, the club entered the Homecoming
Banner Competition, led by the Publicity
Committee's tireless Nikky LaBranche. Even
ikky LaBranche. Even
more strange, the club won a $75.00 cash prize.
Thanks to all who participated.
CAVER8 GO NATIONAL
In a bizarre flurry of television fame, VPI
cavers have been featured in two separate
blurbs on national channels. Carol Zokaites
and five women from Blue Ridge Grotto took
Diane Sawyer on a caving trip which was shown
on Good Morning America. In addition, Matt
Burnett joined Doug Perkins and Joey Fagan
on a Girl Scouts trip which was filmed and
aired on the National Geographic channel.
That show focused on the scouts and heavily
featured Joey's daughter Jessica.
LADIES KEEPING SECRETS
There have been rumors of a secret project
involving some luscious ladies of the club.
What is the project? Will we find out soon?
And speaking of ladies, Kevin Rock easily won
the impromptu Sexiest Secretary Poll. The
ladies of this club are no fools, especially
trainee Kara Smith who jumped right in to
claim him.
NEWSFLASH FROM ERIC STANLEY
Karen Everhardt and Spot Rapier are total
wimps for abandoning this year's Mexico trip.
On the upside, the Tres Burachos have become
the Quatro Burachos as Alison Williams has
proven her worthiness (something about
drinking beer and playing darts as well as the
men). And she hasn't bailed on Mexico yet.
LANDOWNER NEWS
There's been some recent concern over the
land around Stay High Cave. Apparently the
cave landowner wants to develop his property,
and a group of neighbors are fighting to keep
the development in check. Chris Michie
attended some meetings to get the scoop, but
the club's position is officially hands-off. We
don't want to annoy the wrong people!
CAT FIGHT
If you've been on the listserv, that's all that
needs to be said.
PARTY ON!
This year Walt and Lynn Pirie w
This year Walt and Lynn Pirie will host the old
farts' New Years party. You'll have to figure
out the date of the party yourself.
