lower calves, which took weeks to heal. I noted
that the muscles on the inside of my elbows
were very sore from the climb - probably an
understatement.
One would think the experience and the
bruising would have been enough for any sane
group of people. However, Spring of 675 saw
Don, Jerry, Keith Darnell, and me carrying
close to 600 feet of ladders into Ellison's Cave,
Georgia, to rig 586-foot Fantastic Pit.
However, that is another story... .
MORE CLUB HISTORY
Pam Mohr did some research to find an
explanation of the “Airport Road Young Men's
Chowder & Marching Society, VPI Grotto of
the NSS” slogan. Tom Vigour writes: The
YMC&MS came from an old cartoon called
“Barnaby" drawn by, I think, a guy named
Crockett Johnson. My grandfather had a
hardback collection of many of the strips which
I re-read many times as a kid visiting them in
NH. Barnaby was the kid and he had a fairy-
godfather (complete with wings) named Mr.
O'Mally whose social group was the YMC&MS.
We added Airport Road just for class.
