Triple Wells Ladder Climb, November 2, 1974
by Cheryl Jones
Don Davison wrote an article about this trip which
was published in the Tech Troglodyte in 1974 or
1975. Cheryl recently wrote this recap from her caving
log book notes for submission to the Region Record for
VAR history.
In the '60s and '70s, America led the way in
single rope techniques, developing efficient
climbing systems and mechanisms, and then
static caving rope. However, the Europeans
were not embracing this new, rather precarious
and suspect Yankee technology and continued
to negotiate long drops on steel cable ladders.
Of course a climb of 30 feet or less on a cable
ladder was common in Virginia, and sometimes
we would rig the entrance pits of Clover
Hollow and Newcastle Murder Hole with a
couple of ladders. However, we found it
difficult to imagine our European cousins not
only climbing pits sometimes hundreds of feet
deep on ladders, but also carrying the weight
and bulk of all these ladders through a cave.
Then was born what we figured was a brilliant
and adventurous idea. We would empathize.
We would show ourselves that anything they
could do we could do, if only we were so
inclined. We would try to understand why
ladders would be preferred over ropes. We
would climb Virginia's deepest free-fall pit,
Newberry Cave's 202-foot Triple Wells, on
ladders.
On November 2, 1974, Jerry Redder, Lor
Windle, and I, with Don Davison as our
fearless leader, met Rolf McQueary and Bob
Alderson in Penley's field with 203 feet of
id
borrowed cable ladders and 245 feet of (laid)
Goldline rope. As I recall, we rigged each
ladder to a tree and Rolf and Bob helped us
pull-test them all, checking for loose crimps,
frayed cables, and slipping rungs. In those days,
many ladders were homemade, and not all
ladders were made of expensive stainless steel,
and thus were prone to rust and corrosion
Most ladders were 30 feet long, others 45 feet
long, while others were a bit more or less, or
shortened at the point they had weakened. A
number was placed on each one to indicate
where it would hang in the sequence. We fitted
each with matching carabiners on each end's
leads. Then we numbered each ladder, placing
the ones in which we had less confidence at the
bottom. No doubt we also put the Goldline to
a pull test, as was the practice in those days.
We threw the rope and ladders down the
entrance canyon and loaded them on our backs
for the trip through the upper cave. However,
moving the rope and all those ladders through
the crawlway leading to Triple Wells was rather
a challenge, as anyone who has been there can
imagine. Don perched at the edge of the pit to
help feed the ladders over the lip. Each
successive ladder was laid out along the small
passage and clipped on to the top of the
growing chain of ladders, then lowered. Before
the top reached the lip, the next ladder was
clipped on to it.
Once the full ladder chain was connected and
over the lip (and on belay!), it was clipped into
the hanger on the third bolt out into the drop.
We rigged the rope with a “precarious clove
hitch on a rock," as I wrote in my journal, then
with a loop onto the first two bolt hangers to
maintain tension on the knot. The rope was
lowered into the pit, carefully, to keep the end
from feeding through the rungs, or otherwise
becoming entangled in the free-hanging ladder.
A carabiner was clipped into the one that held
the ladder to the bolt hanger, and the rope
placed in the carabiner. Thus, the rope now
hung in the pit within inches of the cable
ladders.
Rolf and Bob arrived as we prepared to
descend, as witnesses to the act. Don and I
climbed down the 203 feet of free-swinging
ladders, self belayed by a Gibbs ascender
attached to the loosened shoulder strap of our
ascending harness. To rest, we would place a
loop of webbing attached to our seat harness
over a rung and clip it back into the seat. (We
were concerned about simply clipping on the
rung with a 'biner – transferring our weight to
