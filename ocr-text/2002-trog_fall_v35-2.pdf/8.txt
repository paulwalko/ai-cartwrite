A.1. Cartwright Winners Through the Years: Some of VPI Cave Club's Finest
by Sandy "the Newer" Warner
Over the years, many people have contributed
to the cave club “above and beyond” their call
of duty. This article mentions a few of the A.1.
Cartwright award winners through the years. I
have enjoyed learning about different
contributions to the club and hope that y'all
will enjoy reminiscing about some of the
people who have given to the VPI Cave Club to
make it what it is today.

1980: (THE LATE) DON DAVISON
Don was an innovator of caving equipment an
technique. The present day rope walker with
the over the shoulder cam was developed by
Don. He tested equipment for the NSS Safety
Techniques Committee and was not afraid to
question the safety or integrity of new
equipment. In Ellison's Don Davison and
Cheryl Jones did the bolt climb from the 510
ledge, making the 586 possible. He also wrote
and sang cave ballads.
Don always credited VPI for their support of
him during his caving adventures and we want
to honor him for what he did for the caving
community.
EARLY 80'8: PETE SAUVIGNE
Pete had contributed to the
cave club as storekeeper, safety
chair, and OTR contestants. He
was active with trainees and
organized and instructed a
practice rescue.

interest in, cooperation with, and support of

involved VPI Cave Club
friends in some big mapping
projects, and participated at
various parties (sometimes by
getting drunk and
obnoxious). Thanks “Whitt”
for your contributions!
1979: DOUG PERKINS
Doug had been caying with the club for at least
10 years and had done the music for several
banquets and at least two OTR's by that date.

programs.

and made many
other social
contributions
to the club.
