After lunch we got ready to go underground.
The practice rescue was going to take place in
Tawney's. Dave Colatosti was the patient, and
he was pretending to be hurt in the Moon
Room. Once everyone went underground,
making sure to sign the entry log to the cave,
we brought the stokes into the cave. Mike Cole
was in charge of explaining patient packaging
and patient transport. It took a long time to
package Dave appropriately into the stokes.
Once he was packaged, we began to transport
him out of the cave.
Some of the important things in the
transportation process are that the patient's
head always be higher than his feet. Someone
should also make sure that the patient is
comfortable. I did not think that it would be as
hard as it actually was to get Dave out of the
cave. It took a lot of people and a lot of
patience. We ended up having to go straight
through a stream. But after much effort and
teamwork we successfully and safely got Dave
out of Tawney's.
I am very glad that I participated in this
practice rescue. I learned a lot of information
that I would have otherwise not known. I think
that everyone that participated had a lot of fun,
refreshed their memory, and learned something
new. The people that participated (based on the
entering cave log) were: Philip Balister, Ray
Sira, Ed Fortney, Dave Colatosti, Karen
Everhart, Kevin Rock, Aaron Thomas, Cara
Smith, Chris Grosh, Pete Sauvigne, Matt
Burnett, Chris Lee, John Booker, Kathy
Despain, Michael Hofmann, Eileen O'Malley,
Brad Atkinson, Mike Cole, Mark Eisenbies,
Steve LePera, Steve Wells, Katherine Ferguson,
and Elizabeth Ferguson. Thanks to all who
participated and made this rescue happen.
