VERTICAL RIO

The purpose of this article is to describe a climbing rig which has peuven its
effectiveness in many caves around southwest Virginia. It is not claimed to be the
ultima te rig. Prussik knots are cheaper. Jumars are easier to riy. The strong
points of this design are ease of climbing and safety.
sasically, it is a three car rig. The foot cam straps on the right foot and
the knee cam is attached to the left foot by a length of sling and is held in sus-
pension near the knee by an elastic shock cord which 60es over the shoulder. ihe
foot and knee cams co all of the work. Raisinó one fout ulter arotner allows the
caver to walk up the rope. i'ne shoulder can keeps the body upright, allows a rest
position, and acts as a safety. the seat in this ris also acts as it rappel seat.
Construction: fou'll need 3 jobs, 20 ſt. of 2" weboing, 10 ft. of i", 4-0 ft.
of shock cord, 4 buckles, 4 1" rings, and a large steel locxine carabiner. All
sewing must be done with an awl or sewing machine to ootain lock sticnes, and
sticning will take 10-20 hours. we have access to a parachute snop that will sew
it with a machine if it is laid out in advance.
the foot can assemoly is constructed so that the Cail will ride on the top of
the arch. I'ne buckle should ride on the outside so that an upward pull tigntens it.
I'ne 1" slinis is a safety strap that soes around the neel so that if all else fails,
you will hans Oy tne foot (better than an air rappel) The call is attached by
looping 1" slins throueh its eye. Aeep excess slack out of the slin, to avoid too
much slop. The distance from tne eye to the riuntmost piece of 1" slin, shoulu not
exceed 23" or the liain buckle flay run out of ad jus tient before it's tight, i found
it handy to fold pack the main strap so it just iits out of the buckle. this vives
a knob to pull on and prevents the Duckle from coming completely apart.
The knee cam assembly is inade of 1" sling the foot loop should be tied witne
an overhand knot to keep tension off the stitcnine. i'ne strap with the loose end
goes around the heel and throuzh a suide in tne foot loop to a double ring au juster.
This strap is a safety, but is also required to keep the assembly on, vrill an
extra hole in the cam shell, feed the shock cord through, and secure witi an over-
hand knot on the outside. The shock cord should pass over the left shoulder and be
attached in the back. It should be secured so as to be stretched when standing,
The right seat assembly clips into the seat biner, forms a les loop, and at-
taches to the other half of the seat oy a buckle in the rear. Do not make the les
loops too tight. Ine dimensions shown fit ine; they may not fit you. wince tre
buckle need not come off, foru a knob as in tne foot Cann.
the left seat assembly similarly clips into tne seat like the riant nalf. In
addition, a pack strap goes off near tne puckle to attack and adjust tne shoulder
cam. This buckle shoula come completely apart to remove the shoulder cam.
Ine shoulder strap has a buckle on either end so it can be adjusted to put the
cam on top of the shoulder. 1" webbins attaches the cam to the strap similar to the
foot can arrangement.
I'he front strap clips into the seat piner and attaches to the front buckle on
the shoulder strap. Again, a knob is advised to prevent the puckle fron slipping.
usin, the rini only the seat assembly is neeaed to rappel. ulip your rappel
device into the lar e biner holaing tne half's of your seat togetner.
to climb, the entire ris nust be usea, Do not tisten the safety loop on your
foot too mucn or the main pucale inay loosen. Be sure to au just your seat before
adjusting your shoulder can. This can should be sou on the snoulder, out will
rise up when you put your weiont on it. Wo not over tisten this.
This ri, is easiest to use on a completely vertical drop. if it is less than
vertical, the shoulder cam should be adjusted to rice more to the front to prevent
your face from being pulled into the wall. un slopes and breakovers the urin can be
slipped out of the shoulder Cain and the car will still be functional and safe.
wany of these design features were originated by won wavison Jr. and vary

and for your own convenience. wood luck and have fun.
