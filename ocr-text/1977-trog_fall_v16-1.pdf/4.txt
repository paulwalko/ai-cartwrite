LOR WINDLE;
EDITOR
welcome back, fair reader. unce again this puolication has
emersed from the toil and sweat of yours truly, and it is beoin-
in; to bother me, iho shall take up the saber of penianship when
the falterina nands fail? who snall combat injustice with the
barbs of prose when tne old methods are no lonöer? It is indeed
a question to be considered, I shall produce only two more such
publications before my country serves me the honor to serve them.
all I can say is, 'wood Luck, orld'.
There are many and Glorious plans in the iliaxinö for the rest
of iný editorial life. The next two Tross shall be lorious beasts
that shall assail all wno wondered about the written virility of
the brotto. Plans and indeed projects have been set in lotion to
help the future publications sain the birth tney so richly deserve,
rather than a shelf life of ignominy.
winter quarter shall show a return to much of the old tros
ways. wue to rising costs, it shall be mimeographed out do not
fear; it shall be worth it. For some time now we have recieved
comments from members and other people for another song-000k as
was printed up in winter of 1972. every copy we made was sold to
trainees, associates, and people who heard about it throun word
of mouth (usually in sons, itself). Inerefore we feel that the
time again is right to create such an opus. ive are taking alot
of the old, popular sonis, audino newer sons, correctinë words and
chords, and printing. it is expected to be coinö to the top of
the charts.
prins quarter shall see any research into "The rise and wall
of the Ihird floor", an anecdotal history of Pritchard wormitory
where much of VPI History was made, any persons with information
concernin; the coins-on out there will be welcomed with open arms.
I would really appreciate it. rlso, of course, will be the
WIC Column (probably the last one by the originator and inairman),
and, hopefully, other soodies.
watch for them in your liail-box.
