Cave Coordinate Calculations with a Programmable Calculator
Bill Douty
Ihe plotting of cave survey data by the use of a coordinate systein is fre-
quently faster and more accurate than plotting oy bearing and distance, nowever,
hand calculation of coordinates from raw data is a tine consumins process and
virtually eliminates any advantage gained from use of the coordinate system. vue
to this, a computer has been considered neccessary for reduction of survey data,
Despite the speed with which a computer can process tnis data, the use of a com-
puter is often made impracticle due to inaccessability, cost, or turn-around time..
Now with the advent of the Hewlett-Packard (HP) 25, a low cost programmable
hand calculator, reduction of cave survey data to coordinates can be done quickly
and easily. ware systems will still require the use of a computer, but working
maps or maps of short caves can be done very conveniently.
weveral programs have been developed to use tne in- 25 to cooruinate cave
data, and those that have been found to be most useful are presented here. These
programs can be modified to work on other 11-P calculators.
The programs receive the survey distance in feet, feet and inches, or in
meters; the norizontal and vertical angles are given in de rees, the conversion
of distance (feet to meters or meters to feet) and correction of the norizontal
angle for declination are made by the program. the projrams will also keep a
summa tion of surveyed distance and accept backsisnts.
The main difference between programs is that Program I will take either azi- .
muths or bearing will program 2 will take only azimutis. Program 2 will also roon
track of the total number of courses.
MODIFICATIONS
NU INCHES
if the distance is in feet or meters program lines 04 through 07 can be elim-
inated when keying in the program, or by entering Giu 08 for line 04. Insert
A Y and R between lines 13 and 14. Also skip program instruction step 7.
MILS
The programs do not account for mils, but the conversion can be made by mod-
ifying the programs in order to convert ils to de rees the conversion (360/
6400) must be stored in one of the registers both programs use all eisht of the
registers, so one register must be eliminated. This modification uses the resister
that is for the distance conversion; Register 6. Program 1 converts just the
vertical angle since the horizontal angle is a bearing. Prosram 2 converts both
horizontal and vertical angle. The only program instruction change will be in
Step 4, which would be the conversion from inils to degrees.
DMCASITES
If all the courses are going to be bac sites (or a majority) store the conver-
sion factor (S'IU 6) as a negative value. Note program 2 step 37 should now be
plus (+). Umit comments 6 and 7 or nake any foresites distance a nejative.
