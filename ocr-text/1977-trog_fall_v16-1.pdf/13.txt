a good idea is hard to stop
and we agree. Hearing of
an idea to certify cavers,
we decided that this was
such a good idea that we
should use it, too. so we
developed a criteria and a
rating scale, produced some
identification cards, and
announced and certified all
sorts of drinkers at the
rall Virginia Region Meet-
ing.
vur other major field of
activity has been in our
activities themselves. The
Un uniform was first worn
at the VPI Float Trip and
saw considerable service.
The UTC flas first appeared
at convention where it flew
over the organized mass of
scientific drinkers. Later,
uld Timer's saw the flas
again raised in defiance of
sobriety. It was there that
the true colors were shown.
members of the UTC were made
primarily responsible for
the party music and were
able to keep things well in
hand for several nights.
The vilC also sent represent-
atives to sanction, certify,
and guard the drinking con-
tests run by the uld Timer's
staff. Several DTC members
participated in the contest,
out refused to take any un-
fair advantage over any of
the other participants (In
other words, our represent-
ative from the Northern Sec-
tion came in last). Then,
as mentioned earlier in the
report, at the Fall Virginia
Region meeting members of
the DTC initiated the drink-
er certification program.
So it can be seen that your
UTC is still busily at work
trying to make your world
at little safer to drink in.

for only one year now, but
many and great are the fine
feats we have done in the
interest of safer drinking

There are two major areas
in which the vil.U. has ex-
celled this past year. The
first area is in equipment
production and initiation
of many w.T. programs
across the nation. We have
made a name for ourselves.
