downstream, Valiantly advanced the VW, water sloshing to
and fro inside, and Swamp Fox waving his head and paws out
of the upstream side. At last we gained the bank and shook
our fingers at Phil. We proceeded up the road towards
the rocks and were greeted fondly by our friends,
Coming back across the river was even more fun because
We were almost swept downstram as we chanced near a bottomless
pit in the river bed. Had it not been for Swamp Fox leaping
boldly into Rocky's lap, thereby tipping the car upstream,
we might have been a late entry in the canoe races. And
Phil would have had the last laugh.
Back in the campground we stood around waiting while
climbers ate lunch and/or supper. We were wishing to go to
Spruce Knob, famed as the highest point in the Mountain
State.
The mealtime became so extended that Swamp FOX
considered frying up his catfish, but settled for a few
'possum ears instead.
Finally we were off with Tom, Sarah, Doug, and Whitt in
the Rover, and Swamp Fox, Janet, and I accompanied Rocky
in the vw. On the way to the Knob we passed several
squashed frogs in the road. Swamp Fox, always alert for
choice morsels of food, stomped on the brakes just as Rocky
was accelerating to pass the Rover and we nearly missed an
earsplitting tragedy. A most traumatic experience!
Swamp Fox carefully picked the frogs up and carried them
to the car, Janet, a biology ma jor, was of course intrigued
as to his intentions, Swamp Fox entertained us with various
recipes for preparing frogs. His favorite is to cut them
into thin wafers and fry them in catfish grease; to swampers,
this delicacy is known as "frog chips".
Just below the summit of Spruce Knob, we came upon two
horrendous snow drifts completely covering the road, Before
the drifts stood a flat-bed truck and a Jeep. We lent them
our handy-dandy shovels and after a great deal of slipping,
ramming, spinning, and cursing, the Jeep and the truck were
through both drifts, Tom, with his mighty Land Rover, plowed
through with no trouble, and we all watched appre hensively
as the one-armed Racooon skillfully manuvered the VW through
the snow. A very splendid job.
A look-out pavilion was newly erected on Spruce Knob,
We clambered up the conglomerate-cemented steps to gaze with
rapture at the surrounding countryside, Next on the agenda
was a visit to the Sinks of Gandy Creek, a creek fabled to flow
under an entire mountain with human openings at both ends,
Just imagine!
