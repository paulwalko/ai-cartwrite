SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1969
struggling to keep up with the guide who apparently had a
grudge against cavers, Paul Broughton, geologist and :
herpetologist on the expedition, found time to make the
startling observation that the adjacent rock outcroppings
were not large enough to hold the sun-seeking population
of reptiles as two blacksnakes slithered from beneath his
feet in the knee-high grass. The overwhelming energy of
this group was evidenced in the fact that they were able to
1.ocate and completely explore six of the major cave systems
in the area; cox Fissure Caves # 1&2- 26 and 15 feet respectively,
Green Bottom Cave - 12 feet, Larges Cave - eight feet, Falls
Cave - a twenty foot water crawl, not to mention the hundred
feet of bicycle passage in Wildcat Cave,
Hopes looked bright as O'Meara and Roehr approached
McFadden Cave near Mencota. Reported to be large, the cave
promised a possible rear entrance to the 10,000 foot Vickers
system. The Holston River succummed to the amphibious
machines and mud spewed from four, then eight wheel wells
as the two emerged from the currents. The party fanned out
over the cliff face seeking the cave when tragedy struck!
To cut the melodramatics short, Guy Turenne fell fifteen
feet off of the cliff. Perhaps he had been feeling inferior
to Jim Hixson and Doug Perkins who had been getting all the
attention with their casted forearms (or maybe he wanted an
excuse to go to lunch) so he utilized this opportunity to
snap his own radius and ulna. In Bristol a Dr. McFadden got
Guy plastered and turned out to be the owner of the cave
(permission had been gained from a tenant farmer). The
discovery and subsequent exploration of the four hundred
foot rats nest was anticlimactic,
A pleasant hour was spent by Roehr's crew at Benfield's
Grocery in Mendota learning local history and getting a few
cave locations. The afternoon was spent combing Cunningham's
cliffs for caves with a three hundred foot. crawl the only
major find. A larger cave is still reported but is nearer
to the top of the cliffs than was ventured at this time.
Meanwhile Flower Pot and Whitt were searching out more
small caves on the Wallace quadrangle. The afternoon for
them turned into a four wheel adventure over a mountain,
across a swamp, and down a creek bed on a mapped but non-
existent road. At one point fence posts had to be pulled
out by Moose and a bridge built over barbed wire to advance
the journey back towards "civilization". A yawning a byss
was straddled for several hundred feet which threatened to
widen and set the Bronco on its frame but the only cama ge
occurred later in a stream bed where a vicious rock tried
to take a bite out of the hubcap. .
