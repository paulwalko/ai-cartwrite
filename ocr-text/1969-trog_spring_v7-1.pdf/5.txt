SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1969
every officer needs the support of his fellow Club members
(whioh I think we have). Now, to have this cooperation is all
fine and good, but one more thing is needed to have a well ..
organized club. This other requirement is adhereno.e i by the
Club, to some set of guidelines for its effective running.
This set of guidelines is ususlly manifest in sone sort of ..
constitution, and the Cave Club does have a constitution, The
slight deviations from the constitution in the past are no
reflection on any one, but are actually a reflection on the
Club, Granted, there have been certain complications which
have really loused things up, but now is as good time as any
to start anew.
At a recent meeting, a motion was brought up pertaining
to voting regulations. If you look at the motion clearly you
will see that the voting regulations were not the main issue,
The fact of the matter was that we had a constitution and were
not following it completely.. As I said before, we more or less
got screwed, but now that the "complications" have passed
there is no reason for us not to use our constitution the way
it is now set up..
The past year has had its ups and downs for the Cave
Club, Troubles have come and gone with the overall picture
looking pretty good. A new set of officers is in control
now and it will take awhile for things to get settled down,
(we'll have to learn the ropes", as it were).
The interworking between the officers and the Club,
along with following our constitution, should make the next
as prosperous and hopefully a little bit better than the
preceeding one,
Jim "Moose" Dawson
