defect, the faster it can be remedied. The responsibility
of paying for damage depends, of course, on the circumstances
under which it occured.
In conclusion, it must be said that the sign-out system
has worked very well. However, by bringing to the attention
of the club the reasons why we must try to keep equipment
readily available, it is hoped that all members will be more
inclined to think of others when they check out equipment,
If everyone, old and new members alike, will keep these
things in mind, we will be able to get a lot of use out of
the limited amount of equipment that we have, and hopefully
to keep inconvenience to anyone at a minimum,

... CLIMBING CAM FORCE ANALYSIS
LISIS .
Much controversy has arisen in the last year concerning
the safety of using a VPI Grotto type climbing cam on
goldline rope, Many members of the Grotto have gone as far
as to ban the devices from their ropes, because of supposedly
damaging pressures resulting from the cam's contact with
the rope,
. Because of the controversy over the cam, a model of
which (see NSS NEWS November 1965), was built by Tom Roehr
and John Katon, Russel Peterson and myself decided to put
the little machine to the test.
To analyze the forces encountered in a cam's normal
use we put a 150 pound load on a cam and let it hang from
a short piece of goldline, Angular measurements were
taken immediately to avoid any errors due to creep, It was
found that the cam would sit at an angl√©: of 45 degrees to
the verticle when under loading. Using the 45 degree angle.
and summing moments around the cam pivot, point "A",
the forces on the goldline and the pin were computed,
In doing this it was assumed that the rope would make
contact along the bottom half inch of the cam. Referring
to the diagram, the force at point "D" was found to be
116,80 pounds. The forces increase as the points move closer
to the pivot, "A", until a force of 262.50 pounds 15 found
at the point of final contact, point "C", Forces on the
pin, point "A", were found to be 81.2 pounds in both the
horizontal and vertical directions,
* The most interesting result, of course, was the total
pressure delivered to the rope by the cam, TO compute the
pressure of an area one half inch by one half inch
