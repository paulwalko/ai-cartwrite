THE TECH TROGLODYTE
.. At the bottom of the hundred foot drop which separates
Upper from Lower, we saw the first signs of the evil power
lurking in Penley's. Four cavers from East Carolina had
rappelled down the other end of the pit into Lower Penley's
and through a hole in the floor for another fifty feet..
It, wasn't until all four of them were clown that they realized
it was a dead end; they knew that because they could see all
four blank walls (bright boys); When we arrived they were
trying in vain to prusik out on their wet rope; needless
to say they were happy to see us lower a couple of ladders
and belay them out.
: We took leave of them after a while and NRVCC led the way
through a hole in the wall, down into an amazingly warm, dry
pit, and through a dusty belly crawl. We were approaching
the fabled Penley's Crossover inhabited by all sorts of
roving demons and wicked spirits, not to mention the bodies
of cavers who didn't make it,"Only the night before, the
Club heard Gary Mos's describe Â· very graphically the horrors
of that narrow pass and the somewhat unorthodox but very
effective method that Bobby Lewis employed in traversing:
it. The exhibition that Bill, Doug, and I witnessed was
no less hair-raising: NRVCC, after squeaking around a .
corner on a very tight belay by Bill, stood up very shakily
on one side of the thirty foot gorge and suddenly lunged
at the blank wall four feet away, apparently finding hand holds
on the differences of color in the rock. In any event, after
straddling the crevice for a while, he edged along the landing
at the other end and proceeded to belay the rest of us
across in similar style.

Gazing wistfully into one last pit and wondering how to get
into it besides jumping, I stumbled. accidentally into a
side lead and decided to explore it. Bobby was right behind
me shouting "Virgin, virgini"When I turned around to see
where she was, he zipped by me, Up and up it went, getting
bigger and bigger; NRVCC was going crazy hoping for a new
entrance, but he quieted down when he finally hit his head
on the ceiling. ::
When we finally started to map, the first thing we
surveyed was an insignificant lead about 100 feet long: in
