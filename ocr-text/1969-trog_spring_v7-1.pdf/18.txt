afternoon." Arned with these misconceptions, we headed down
the primrose path to Wildcat Caverns in nearby Wise County,
Virginia. Besides the four of us were four others. There
were two menbers of the Holston Valley Grotto; Jin Groseclose
(chairman), and Clyde Moore. Also along were Jin Hixson
with his ubiquitous dog Linda ; and Art Ringwalt, then from
Richmond, now living in Denver. We were fortunate to have
Art along, as he was the only one of us who had been in
the cave before,
After a stop so I could buy gas, a stop so Hixson
could buy gas, a stop so Jin and Clyde could buy groceries,
a stop at a souvenir stand, a stop so Cletus and I could
stock up on cigors, and several brief stops so Art could
remember where he left the cave, we finally parked the rigs
and changed into caving duds,
In order to reach the easiest of the three entrances,
we walked several hundred yards along a narrow railroad cut
to where we were greeted by a large opening in a limestone
bluff, . Art informed us that the cave followed a curious
pattern, and that we should take 20 minutes for a grand
tour. I asked about the small opening to the left of the
main entrance, "It doesn't go," Art said,
We followed a volumnous corrider for several hundred
feet to the base of a mountain of rubbish, Random sampling
disclosed the contents to be roughly 50% refrigerators by
volume, and 50% car parts, chiefly hub caps. The second
entrance could be viewed from here as an inaccessable
skylight above the garbage heap. Continuing along the
passage for several minutes, we reached the lower end of
the cave which was marked by two elongate pools occupying
the floors of two adjacent canyons. "The water is waist
deep," Art remarked, "We can wade to the other side,"
We viewed the pool with trepidation,
"Let's test the depth," said Hixson, So. a ten-pound
rock was tied onto the zero end of a survey tape, Jim
Gros'eclose climbed to a ledge above the pool and lowered
the rock. Twenty feet of tape whizzed rapidly through
his hands as the rock sank -- 30 feet -- 40 feet -- "ry god!"
-- the rock plumpeted downward into the dark depths, carrying
yard after yard of white, glistening tape,
"Sixty foot mark coming up!" shouted Jim, Finally
the tape went slack and stopped as the rock settled, presumably
on the bottom. A few tugs reassured us that the rock was
still attached. The depth was noted and rock and tape :
