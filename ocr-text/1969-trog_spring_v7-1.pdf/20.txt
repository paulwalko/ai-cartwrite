THE TECH TROGLODYTE
"Tie in at this station!" they shouted as Cletus approached,
"We haven't gotten this far yet," he said.
"Have you gotten to the big room yet?"
"NO.".:
..
...
"Have you gotten to the trash heap yet?".
"No,"
"Then how far have you gotten?"
"We've just started into the entrance." Cletus told
them about what we had found in the "no-go" section, and
returned to join us for lunch by the railroad tracks,
Hixson's crew had encountered sinilar mud-choked crawls
that never quite seem to pinch out.
We resumed mapping in the main section of the cave and,
three hours later, tied into Hixson's survey. Adding up
the survey shots, we found that our combined efforts had
amounted to 4,800 feet of mapped passage that day. Both teans
had left many side passages. untouched, but we were determined
not to miss any socializing, So we headed back to Pennington
Gap in a blinding rainstorm, Hixson and I decided to meet
at the cave again in two weeks to finish it up.
Two weeks later saw Annie and I, along with Dale Parrott
and Bob Amundson make a 3:00 a,1, departure from Blacksburg.
Five hours later we were standing at the entrance to the
cave, Jim Hixson was not there yet, but arrived shortly
with the legendary "Beasty" and his sex-maniac dog, Linda,
On our previous visit, we had not investigated the
third entrance. While mapping it on the second trip, we
found the third entrance to be unique among entrances,
At one time it had been the only drainage exit for a large
internittent strean valley. Then the railroad was constructed,
and a fill for the roadbed threatened to block the entrance,
The railroad company foresaw the creation of a 300-acre
mudhole, however, and laid two 7-foot-diameter concrete
sewer line8 beneath the fill so water could flow under the
tracks and into the cave, The junction between pipes and
cave. was sealed to prevent the fill from sloughing into the
cave, so in order to use this entrance, one must negotiate
several hundred feet of concrete sewer. THAT AIN'T ALL,
For some reason (to keep cows out of the cave, perhaps?),
a grating made of discarded steel rails was built across
