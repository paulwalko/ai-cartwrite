Thursday night was spent. in a churchyard just over the
Alabama line', and Friday morning the whole crew wa's off
for Neversink Pit near Scottsboro, Alabama. Nêversinki:
offers a very impressive entrance, about fiftỳ by seventy:
feet. The pit is very easy to find since all one has to do
is follow a water pipe a quarter mile up the hill to the .
entrance, Neversink consists of nothing but 165 free fall
feet of nothingness. There are no leads at the bottom, : :
but the pit is a photographer's cream with water falling in
sheets over green móss on the sides, Most everyone was
surprised to look up and see a long log jammed between two
walls over sixty feet: in the air.,: indicating that water gets
rather high in the pit.
After seeing and photographing all of Neversink that
we could, we took off down Ala, Route 65; to the Gerry Self
Pits on Bingham Mountain, This was an ambitious assault;
since we would have to find the pits in the dark, but this
proved to be no problem. A long path leads up Bingham
Mountain about three quarters of a mile to the double
sixty foot pit entrance. We rigged the entire cave, drops
of sixty, forty, then sixty feet consecutively, with one
345 foot hunk of virgin goldline. After signing the register
on the third level we headed for the crawl out entrance
which by the map was supposed to be eighty feet away, but
turned out to be about 1,500 feet away by our estimation,

much deeper,
Soon after we arrived Darwin Moss of Huntsville Grotto

which a number of us used instead of our kinky goldline,
