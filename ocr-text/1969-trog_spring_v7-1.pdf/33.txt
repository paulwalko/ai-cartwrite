SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE

Looking around. I noticed a glove, here, a pair of pants
-- there and other assorted goodies. Questioning Jim (I thought
the sly old fox might have brought a bunch of girls up on:
a earlier trip), he gave a quick and crisp reply. "Most cavers
who get out of Windy Mouth are usually so tired that they
don't give a damn about their equipment and just throw
it down on the ground, stomp on it, and grind it into the .::
dirt, I knew that the trips into Windy Mouth were credited
as being rather long and tedious, but this seemed rediculous.
VS. After being given knee pads, a most essential piece of
gear, We headed off towards the cave which is located on a
...cliff overlooking the Greenbrier River; The river was high
that day and the path around was submerged. We had to climb
the cliff and while up there, "Easter Pig". gave a full
detailed account of how he fell off a similar cliff face
and plummeted into a river below. We, of course, weren't
the least bit nervous because we knew that we were only
one hundred feet above this river.

Meanwhile the funny-looking kid was taking all this in
great form. She was doing some of her own strange mane uvers
as we climbed, she even tried to play a real nasty trick
on me but I told her I just wasn't old enough for that sort
of thing.
Into the crawlway we squirmed . Our carbide lamps dimly
lit the passage as we struggled over the broken rock floor.
But, will wonders never cease, the passage became large enough
so that we could walk in ape-like manner (trne troglodytic
manner: if I ever saw one). The passageway continued to grow
and soon we came to First Canyon. After crossing this,
narrow drop we camer to Second Canyon and rested for a few
minutes, Linda began to develop a passionate look in her
eyes but we started to go down the passage before she had time
to do anything., ".

".. "After a few of us went down to the second level of the
cave we remembered poor Linda still panting with desire in
the upper passage." She sure changed her tune when we brought
her down and became very passive until we brought her up out
of the canyon after mapping.

The lower passage was filled witha lot of breakdown
through which a stream meandered. We proceeded to the last
survey station and split up into two mapping parties,
The mapping party that I was on consisted of Jim, John, and
myself, 0. Of course the shy Linda was in our party too. The
other group consisted of "Easter Pig" and the two other cavers
we had found wandering around. Lewisburg,
