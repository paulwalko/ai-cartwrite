imprints in the sandstone, Looking around a little, we
could see that the ceiling was literally covered with fossils,
Linda got rather excited in her efforts to find good,
whole specimens. The shells, I am told, were Brachiopods
and what we saw were the replaced remains of the upper
valves, To be more specific, they were the wing-like
Spiriferids dating from the Devonian, (WOW?) In addition
to the shell imprints, there were lots of fossils, which
the less educated of us called Cheerios, but which were, of
course, Crinoid stems. Also, there were examples of boxwork,
minerals that had been deposited in cracks of rock that
nas less soluble than the surrounding material and left
a very delicate lattice work when the rock had been worn
away. We came across gypsum needles that were perfectly
clear and most were between five and seven inches in length,
Several pools, which were cry at the time, were filled with
calcium carbonate crystals, that is, dogtooth spar, looking
rather ominous and doing absolute wonders for the knees.
The Christmas Room was basically similar to the first
formation section, but these formations were whiter and more
extensive, the soda straws thinner and taller, helictites
more intricate, and the flowstone more impressive, As soon
as one enters the room winter and Christmas come to mind; the
crystals strikingly resemble snow (well, maybe, to those that
have an imagination). The picture taking really got going
and just about every formation of interest (and some not)
were flashed at, Tom even got camers happy and had us point
at a bat or something while we posed, which is really going
to look great, After polishing off a can of sardines and
one of kippered herring,we got direction straight and
started out,
With strains of "A Mighty Fortress is our God" led by
Linda and Anne alternating with cries of "Hamburgers!", we
made very good time going out, We spent about five hours Â·
in the cave and it was a very enjoyable and rewarding
experience,
