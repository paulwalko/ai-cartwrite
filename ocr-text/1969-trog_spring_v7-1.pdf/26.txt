SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE_
1969
SENECA
Under the pretense of attending the annual Whitewater ..
Canoe maces at Mouth of Seneca, West Virginia on April 12-13,
the entire VPI Grotto lit out for the area, with the exception:
of a few die-hards,
First to leave were George Neall, Danny-and-Lynn, and
String Bean Peterson. They were so apprehensive as to the
outcome of the evening's Club elections that they left
in the early afternoon so as not to be around for the after-
meeting muggings. After the meeting, Tom Roehr filled his
weak-sprung Land Rover with seven bodies and headed north.
Included in the inelee were Sarah Critzer and R,E, Whittemore,
known for their cravings for a good smoke and loads of fresh
air; Karl Berge, our very own leprechaun; Doug Draves, Steve
Hall, and the ever-fainting Tricia Botticelli, Their trip
was livened by numerous stops to buy poisonous hamburgers,
to buy gas, to whiz, to barf, and to let Tricia faint,
Nonetheless, they arrived at Seneca Campground and racked
out. Also leaving Friday night were Phil Moritz, Boots Good,
Libby Hecker, and Jim Heard, complete with Whitt's gear, a
phonograph, and a complete selection of Gordon Lightfoot's
albums,
The first two carloads proceeded to climb about on
Seneca Saturday morning after locating missing climbing gear,
Lynn and Tricia decided they could better spend their time
by exploring the Dolly Sods with Gary Moss, and Sarah traipsed
faithfully along the river bank watching the canoe. races.
Early Saturday morning, Jack O'Meara packed Jan Queisser,
The Hitch Hiker, and two drunks, later discovered to be
Bill Corley and Pablo, into his Bronco, and also headed
north. They arrived in time to do some four-wheeling amongst
the nearby hills, in the Potomac River just as the canoe
races started, and to help Sarah watch the races,
Later Saturday morning, Rocky Raccoon, Swamp Fox, and
the Gremlin left VPI for Seneca. Our progress was slowed
considerably because Swamp Fox insisted on sampling every
dead 'possum on the roadway. Once we stopped to catch a few
catfish for his dinner, another time to pick persimmons, and
a gain to gather watercress at Falling Springs. Finally we
arrived at the parking area below Seneca Rocks and grabbed
Rocky's spyglass to spy on all our friends on the rocks,
When joined by Phil's group, we sat down for lunch on
the rocks, On a dare from Phil that a Volkswagen would never
make it across the ford, Rocky Raccoon revved up his engine,
Into the water we splashed, the swift current pushing us
