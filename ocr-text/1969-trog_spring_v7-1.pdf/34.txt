After mapping for about seven hours we returned to
the canyon which was our meeting place. The other cavers
soon arrived and we compared notes. Each party had mapped
around: fifteen hundred feet of the designated passages,
While we were talking I also learned that the other pa's.sa ge
was a wide and spacious one; ours narrowed down into a
crawl (that sure is my luck).

We departed from Windy Mouth around three o'clock in
the morning. After a hasty and not very appetizing meäl;
:in some dump called The Bone or some other God fore saken:
name, we slept in the WVACS field house;
That: noon we left for good old VPI Cave Club country
and I returned to the dull everyday routine of doing my
homework; (Isn't this a great ending).

CAVING IN NORTHERN ALABAMA AND GEORGIA :::
A grubby bünch of cavers couldn't have asked for better
weather after a..cloudburst trip from Blacksburg, Virginia
to Trenton, Georgia, Arriving in Trent on on Thanksgiving
Day our two car parade spotted a huge; bläck, pointed-head
troglodyte: standing on the road. After making the most of
the paper mache troglodyte, we made a decision to make Byers
Cave the target for the day, since our directions to Cemetery
Pit were very poor,
...Directions to Byer's Cave were not much better and we :
searched a good bit of Dean's Gulf on Fox Mountain before
finding the cave entrance. From the entrance varied walking,
crawling, and climbing passage leads back to a fissure
crawlway about two hundred feet long. "The fissure finally
drops out over a large, shale, canyon passage. The seventeen
foot drop was rigged with a ladder and our fearless crew :::
set out in search of the formation that Byers Cave is famous
for.

..As we started out through the U-shaped canyon passage
we thought we were wasting our time, but then eight minds :::
blew at once as we suddenly happened onto beautiful columns,
spires, and flowstone formations, Out came the cameras and
everything of merit was photographed; ;
