The most interesting result, of course, was the total
pressure delivered to the rope by the con, TO compute the
pressure an area one half inch by one half inch was used:
and the force was averaged to 189 pounds over the area of
contact. This.y #okd.s an average pressure of 756 pounds
per square inch with the maximum being 1048 pounds per
square inch and the minimum being 464 pounds per square inch,
Since the maximum pressure that nylon can withstand
under pure compression is approximately 35,000 pounds per
square inch*, it is seen that the car is safe since its
pressure will rarely exceed 1,300 pounds (depending on
your weight). ..
Thus, damage to goldline rope fron a can would probably
result only from the can slipping under a load and creating
damaging heat, Damage would probably also occur to the
sisal fibers found in the outer lays of goldline, since the
sisal does not have the compressive strength of nylon.
In conclusion, I would like to say that the cam is
& safe device when used with care (as is the case with most
good caving devices). Like junars, knots, and hieblars,
the can will be abrasive to your rope, but this is all in the
use, so MAY YOUR FEARS BE LAID TO REST but not your cams:

THE SAGA OF WILDCAT CAVERNS
The regular Friday night Grotto meeting being over,
my wife Annie and I, along with Cletus Lee and Sarah Critzer
loaded up the Bronco and were out of town before sundown.
About 2:00 a.m., we arrived in Pennington Gap, Virginia;
scene of the annual Virginia Region Spring Project, After a
brief snooze at the nearby Fairgrounds, we met Dr. Holsinger
at the Shelbourne Hotel, where he was busy assigning various
jobs to the assembled groups. Our prime objective was to
get away with doing as little work as possible, sto.y dry,
and socalize as much as we could.
The cave Dr. Holsinger had in mind for us to do sounded
like just the ticket; "...nearby, has three entrances,
large walking passages, dry, and you can finish it in one
