adjusted" or at peace with one smenvironment.
The underground world has been called one of the last
frontiers and it is in the exploration of these frontiers that
we have chosen to establish our identities, to set ourseltes
just far enough away from the crowds so as to feel important,
Caving may not be our vocation but at least on weekends and
meeting nights we can experience that type of superiority;
whether false or not, which reinforces our self-concepts,
Isn't nonconformity fun, Aren't you glad you tried it. Don't
you wish everybody did? No, you don't: Without such a thing
as a normal person there would be nothing on which to base
the percept of nonconformity and all that juicy derived status
would never materialize,
My poor head is getting tired trying to think up these
five dollar sentences while cramped in this crawlway so I'll
try to get to the point. We have to live with the conformed
society and there is nothing really drastic we can do about it
except antagonize its members. These include cave owners and
the people we bump into on our way to and from caves and while
we are in our groups, even school employees. It may surprise
some of the readers to know that these people are occa sionally
interesting to talk to and in many instances quite beneficial
to be on good terms with. In any case it is better to have
a person on your side than against you. So, to whom it may
concern, let's keep our cool and act civilized so that
spelunking can remain an open sport and we can be proud to
call ourselves cavers and keep our easy excuse for caving. .

assumed their positions. The officers were chosen by the Cave
Club members, who think the officers will do the best job in
the positions to which they were sleoted, Any of the other
candidates could probably have done just as well as the people
now in office, but one must remember that it is not only the
capability of the person elected, but also the organization
that makes a good officer.
The responsibilities that go along with each job, naturally
are quite different. Together, however, they all help in the
running of the Club, To run an organization effectively,
