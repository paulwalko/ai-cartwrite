THE TECH TROGLODYTE_
1969
A party (would you believe a real orgy) followed at the
Airport Road Home for Wayward Dogs and Lost Women, and as best
as anyone can remember, a great time was had by all, even

"MAZING, SIMPLY 'MAZING
After signing the register at the owner's house (who is,
incidently, aware of the values of cave concervation and
vandalism in the cave, we, Tom Roehr, Craig Ellenfield, Anne
Whittemore, Linda Heitz, "Boots" Good, and myself, entered
the wet entrance of Paxton's. There are two openings both

very long, thin soda straws, Since three of us had brought
camera's, everyone took off in different directions to seek
out the most photogenic of the formations. After a lot of
hey-look-at-thises, did-you-get-a-picture-of-thats, and

As we traveled, we came across some interesting examples
of the cave's artwork, (Its very own). In the part of the cave
where the limestone bed was in contact with a layer of
sandstone the ceiling was made of this material. No one was
very thrilled at the existance of the sand stone until we
stopped for a carbide change and for Tom to make sure that we
were still going the right direction, while staring blankly
at the ceiling someone casually observed that there were shell
