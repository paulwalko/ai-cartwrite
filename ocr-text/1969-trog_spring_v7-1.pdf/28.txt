THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1969
'On the way we stopped at Spruce Knob Lake and a fire
tower. Then we drove and drove; the twilight flowed and the
sunlight ebbed, and still there seemed no stopping Tom. Once
I remarked that I thought the cave was over a far hill, having
been there six years earlier, but still Tom drove on. Finally
t'e Rover stopped and Whitt jumped out.
"We're having a disagreement, Doug and I think that
we've already passed the cave., and Tom thinks that we have
to go beyond the main highway."
"Well," says I, "I believe it was back near the last big

In the morning we were greeted by streaming sun rays,
the tromping of hoofed feet through our campsite, the smell

On Sunday, Rocky Raccoon and I walked up the dirt slope

The Landed Gentry convinced Jack that his Bronco couldn't
make it to the Dolly Sod's; Jack, Sarah, Pablo, Doug, and Bill
