The next day proved more productive for Ellenfield's 7,
group as they ventured towards home territory and mapped' 500
feet in Coon Cave near Newberry-Banes. .
** Three four-by-fours climbed a sinkhole pocketed mountain
to no avail as far as caves were concerned. The days
activities included a mile and a half nature walk to a cave
whose eighty foot entrance drop had been filled with mud
since our guide had last been there. Digging was ineffective,
Although there were no major finds for the weekend; a good
portion of the Brumley, Wallace, and Mendota quadrangles ..
were covered. It is assumed that all had a great time as :
usual for a ciub project whether or not anything constructive
gets done.

WINDY
After being filled with the spirit of a Cave Club,
party, when my resistence was low, I was introduced to
Jim Hixson anc the voluptuous Linda Hixson, Now Jim was:
planning a trip to Windy. Mouth Cave in West Virginia and needed
some more focis to go along. The trip already had the notable
"Easter Pig" on its roster and a Tennessee volunteer, John
Powers,."Of course I'll go, " I found myself saying in a
stupefied voice, "any time, just let me know",
Thus, early next morning I found myself being whisked
away in a strange car (the inside was mohair seat covers): ...
with strange looking cavers, as if all cavers aren't weird
Tooking, and a funny looking kid named "Linda (whose measurements
incidentally are 24-18-15).
We arrived in Lewisburg, West Virginia;: around one
o'clock, ate at the Court Restaurant, and apped out to ??.)
Windy Mouth. Along the way our little party picked up two
more foolhearty cavers. After driving to the farthest ins:
stretches of the road and then some', we changed into our
caving duds,"
