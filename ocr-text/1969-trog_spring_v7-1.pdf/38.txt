it would sink, This made everyone so wet and miserable that
at last we heard NRVCC's famous last words:::"I quitt I'm
never comin' to this @&#0* cave again!! I'm never goin

With that we packed up and escaped from the bowels of..
the earth without being attacked by giant spiders or
anything. Being the first one back to the bottom of the 100
foot pit, I began searching for thë rope. It was gonel I
thought some thieving troll had stolen 1t when I saw the end
hanging in a bundle twenty feet from the ground. Apparently
it had slowly twisted while we were gone... Anyhow, With Doug

prusik to lasso the rope and pulled it down. 77
