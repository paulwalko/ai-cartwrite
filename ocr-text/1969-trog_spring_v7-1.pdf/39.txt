SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1969
The site was the well known and popular Trout Creek
Shelter which, by some: miracle.., is still standing. Here
people were confronted with about twenty gallons of
spa'ghetti and two and a half kegs. So, with many improvisions
on utensils, the group dug in. There followed the traditional
sing on the roof, drink on the roof, and fall off of the
roof. By midnight all but a few hardy, rather stupid souls'
had: left., gone to sleep, or passed out..
1. Early next morning began the race to see who could
get out first and not have to clean up. Finally all the
odds and ends of the night before were collected and stashed.
Some of these items included :: two mugs, four cups, two fork's,
one spoon, one body, one half keg of beer, a vat of leftover
spaghetti, and one marshmallow. After the table was scrubbed
off with assorted leaves and vines, the farewells were said
and the place left in peace until next year,
Kia ja."

found and killed the dreaded glawa o kus. The animal had first

countryside. It is reported to have killed several dogs in
Western Connecticut, It had sought shelter in the Cave of the
Bashful Lady after having been trapped and almost killed
in Indian Oven Cave, Boston Corner,
The mission began on Sunday morning with many spel√ºnkers
gathered for the hunt. A girl named Helen Price was used for
baitat: After the spelunkers had trapped the glawackus in
the recesses of the cave it was killed with a second shot
from a horse : pistol, the first shot having missed,
Examination of the beast showed it to be a cross between
a bear and a linx and that both its eyes and fangs glowed
::: in the dark. It was three feet long and weighed ninety pounds,
Further examination revealed tiny suction cups on the paws
by means of which the animal had traversed cave walls, ceilings,
