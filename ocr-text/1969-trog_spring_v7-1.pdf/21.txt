the opening. Needless to say, a large log jam has accumulated
just outside the entrance, all but blocking it entirely.
We were honored on this particular trip by a surprise
visit from the distinguished Dr. Holsinger, Arriving just .
in time for lunch, he had come hoping to collect beetles,
Earlier in the day, we were nearly eaten alive by pest cave
beetles, Evidently, these bugs can smell pickling alcohol
a long way off, for when the professor arrived with
his collecting gear, they had all migrated north for the
summer. Not one beetle could be found.
Jin Hixson employed the use of an air mattress float
to take some additional soundings in the terminal lakes and
explore some hidden nooks. Everything went 0.k. until
he fell off the float and nearly drowned, but he managed
to escape, losing nothing more than gobs of body heat..
After rapping for eleven hours, we stumbled back to
the cars, having reached a total of over 6,000 feet of
mapped passage.
But that wasn't the end. Upon drafting his portion
of the map, Jim realized that one measly lead had been
overlooked on the second trip. Three months later, he was
back at Wildcat Caverns, Outstanding among his crew members
(besides the infamous Linda) was Sariy Taylor, This was
his annual caving trip.
The unsurveyed leac proved to be just a little over
a hundred feet long. It was napped, and one survey. shot
which had somehow been omitted in the notes was re-taken,
closing out the survey at 6,195 total feet. Jim was
appall.ed to discover that enough garbage had been cumped
into the cave in three months to completely block the
skylight entrances
And so the mapping of Wildcat Caverns was completed,
It is the largest cave in Wise County, and one of the
Commonwealth's major systems, Southwestern Virginia is full
of surprises, but Wildcat Caverus seemed to have more than
its share-- fortunately, it lived up to its name virtually
and not literally.
