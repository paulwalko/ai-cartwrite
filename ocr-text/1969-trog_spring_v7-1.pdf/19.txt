were withdrawn intact -- no tangles -- it was an honest
reading. Folks, that pool is sixty-nine feet deep!
Subsequent soundings were comparable, ""Waist deep,
huh!" said "Jin, "we can wade across, huh!"
"That's what a local boy told me," Art confessed.
Finally the mapping began, Hixson, Ringwalt, Groseclose,
and Moore would begin at the pool and work toward the entrance,
Annie, Sarah, Cletus, and I would return to the entrance and
survey in.
Back at the entrance, we decided to explore the small
"no-go" lead to the left of the main entrance. It appeared
to continue as a low crawl for at least a short distance,
so we decided to "run a few shots" into it. Several hundred
feet of mapping later, we were standing in large virgin
passage. But the large part didn't last long. . We spent
six hours mapping 1400 exasperating feet of mud-choaked
crawlways. The distance a passage went seemed to vary
inversely with its cross-sectional area,
At one point, Annie refused to go any further due to
the presence of a "dead, partially-eaten something-or-other"
in the passage,
"It's bloody, and all covered with maggots!." she shrieked.
"Look, Sarahi"

"Yes, I see it -- oh, gross me out!
eye looking up at us!"
"I'm going to be sick."
"Let's leave."
After a cursory investigation of the object, cletus.
proclaimed it to be a can which had washed into the cave.
But the ladies were not convinced, and refused to approach
it any closer. Finally I threw a rock at it, . It fell over
with a clatter. It was nothing more than a horribly mutilated
paint can. The ladies carried their respective ends of
the tape on past the can, still eyeing it with suspicion.
Our "no-go" section did not connect with the rest of
the cave, so we returned to the surface, : Since the cars
were handy, I raided then for lunch makings while. Cletus
paid a visit to the other group to compare notes on what
progress had been made so far.
