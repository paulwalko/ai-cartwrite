Who oins caves? A down-to-earth question with a down.

the caves 11 they will not lực vs into them. If this is true
and what cover would argue(?), then it follows that as
owners of the caves we should do 2.11 we can to protect our
ownership,
: 30 we must keep the land owners happy. . Before leaving
for your cave find out as much as you can about the land
oiner and the status of your cave, If it is not necessary to
2 sk permission, check oocasionally to make sure that there
has been no change in status, If there is any doubt, aşk:
After years of study in the greatest caving area in the
world, a well known research center has come to the conclusion
thet there is no ore way of asking for permission. Forever it
did come up with some guidelines for handling the pseudo-
cave owner, the land owner; i .. .
1. When around the land orner pretend that he really does :
own the cave,
2. Be informal and riendly. Shows of intellicence were
found to be looked down upon by many land owners. Use
laynon terms when talking "cave". Fost land oirners like
to hear about caves under their lend (especially if there
is a possibility for the capitalistic On ner to exploit
them). Try to maximize the esthetic value and minimize
any possible physical value.
3. Ii che land owner appears to want to talk don't rush
off. It may be just another delay to you. but it may
be the highlight of the week to him. Be polite even if
he says "no". Even if you can't change his mind at least
you can leave a good impressiori of cavors, Text time he
might say "yes",
4. Be sure to let the land owner know when you expect to
be out (the very latest possible. Time) and ask if he
wants you to let him know when you are ovc. If so, be
sure to do so. If you make any promisos (such as sending
pictures) be sure to follow up on them. The fever
promises you' mo.ke the better,
. 5. Ask where to park and that route to take to the cave and
then follow his directions closely. Be veryº cautious not
to harm crops and livestock (carry your carbide avay).
Leave all gates. as you found ther, either open or closed.
