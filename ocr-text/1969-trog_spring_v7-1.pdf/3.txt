Here I sit in two inches of mud and water in a passageway
So low that I can't straighten my neck, Kneecaps have been
replaced by indistinguishable masses of bruises and cuts, I
shiver, not only from the chill which has penetrated my bones
but experience tells me that it will be several hours of
crawling, agonizing climbs over slippery breakdown, and a
final 100 foot prusik before I am safely out and sitting in
some hamburger jointi. It is times like these that we all ask
ourselves the enigmatic question, "Why do I go caving?".
Of course there can be no single answer for spelunkers
as a whole. Some of the more apparent excuses we like to
come up with are that it is fun, it is good exercise, it is
a test of endurance, and the ever popular, "Because it's there".
As evidenced by the invalidity of the first entry on this
list excuses such as these are employed by the neophyte caver
or by the older spelunker who finds it necessary to ration-
alize his behavior in mixed company. Camera buffs and
scientists get off of the hook rather easily since they seem
to have a socially acceptable reason for venturing underground,
When in the fellowship of other cavers our explanations
tend to become more complex. Phrasos such as, "adventure and
excitement" and " the quest to go where no man has gone before"
pervade our reasoning." The difficulty arises in the fact
$hat our fellows need the reinforcement of a more explicit
excuse to keep them underground. We continually try to tease
out an answer from each other in hopes that we will be
rewarded with a tidy little quantity which will dispell the
feelings of insecurity associated with our seemingly irrational
behavior.
Sigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis who liked
to attribute behavior patterns to childhood experiences, would
probably come up with a term for cavers such as an Edimuck
Complex or someone who, in his youth, had a frust rated desire
to obtain a sexual relationship with a mud pie, Other
psychologists may argue, quite understandably, that some
cavers have masochistic or self-torture tendencies and people
who organize trips are basically sadists.
Regardless of what excuses we give I believe that the
secret to a cavers true constitution is nonconformity. The
population of the world is so large that it is hard for a
person to distinguish himself as an individual and achieve
the personal status associated with his individuality. The
forming of an identity and a strong self-concept have long
been realized by psychologists such as Curt Lewin and Dr. John
C. Armstrong as as ma jor steps in the road to being "well
