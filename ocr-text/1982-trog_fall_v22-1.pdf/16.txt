called it "Pretty 160."
Reunited at the top of the Balcony Room a while later, we did a
repeat shot of Gary at the top of the drop, beginning the rappel.
This time it worked; two big bulbs did the trick, there was no blur.
I called the shot "Abyss."
With the last of the superbulbs exhausted, we beat a path back
to the surface. The final trip had taken just over ten hours.
We all parted company: the others returned to their dull lives
of drinking and debauchery, and I returned to the spine-tingling
excitement of the darkroom. Several weeks later I had cranked out
a batch of prints to be distributed to the people on the trips,
interested bystanders, and the NSS Photo Salon Judges.
The finished prints were good. They had required over 30 hours
of caving time on my part alone, a lot of grunting and groaning
from a bunch of kind-hearted, patient friends." I was sure the
judges would like "Pretty 160" the best, with "Moss' Long Shot".
running a close second. As usual, I had mis judged the Judges; they
liked that damned arachnid "Daddy-Long-Legs"12 which had taken about
two minutes to set up and shoot.13
So that's the story of how I got the Big Shots... A lengthy tale,
I must confess, but nonetheless a lot of fun.
. I have, of late, begun to think of some of the other pits that
I might apply my techniques to; and I'm sure that I can recuit some
of my good old caving buddies to help me out...again.
Unfortunately Gary suddenly left town for Antartica, Glen hasn't
been seen in several months...left his job rather suddenly. Most
Curious.
Footnotes:
1. Gary received the title Yo-Yo not so much for his intellect, but
rather for his caving style. He had recently tried to pass through
the infamous "Pinch" connection between the Bone and Norman's caves
and had been able to negotiate the passage due to some extra poundage
acquired at the local pizza parlor. This amused the VPI cavers so
much that they awarded Gary the Yo-Yo caver of the year award in
hopes that he would stick to big drops (at which he is quite
proficient) and keep out of tight squeezeways (in which he is not).
2. Phantom's First Law of Cave Photography: The weight of camera
equipment is directly proportional to the time it must be carried.
3. Phantom's Second Law of Cave Photography: (Self-Preservation).
The value of the equipment, the proposed photographs, and the
photographer's life decreases rapidly over the duration of the trip.
4. Named after Bill Cuddington.
5. Ethyl Alcohol is quite good for this purpose; in extreme cases
offers of food or threats of bodily harm will sufice. In this
instance I offered to buy him a beer or two when (and if) we got out
alive.
6. Phantom's Third Law: (This probably overlaps one of Murphy's
Laws). In any cave photographic situation, the most expensive piece
of apparatus will break down first, the least expensive piece will
never break down. My camera has been repaired three times in six
years. I'm on my third tripod, the Honeywell was rebuilt once and
the crummy $15 Vivitar flash has never failed once.
7. Misery Loves Company. This is blatantly plagerised, but is just
too appropriate to leave out. The genius who first uttered these
great.words must have accompanied some cave photographer in the recent
past.
