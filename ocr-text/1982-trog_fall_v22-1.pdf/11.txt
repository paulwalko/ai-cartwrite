Stalking The Big Shot
A. minor treatise in which several fundamental laws of Cave
Photography are ennumerated,
By Chip Clark
Encouraged by some past successes in (mostly horizontal) cave
photography, I began to contemplate the virtues of a big, beautiful
pit shot; one that would elicit excited grunts from my fellow
cavers, and scare the pants off of my insurance agent.
My quest took me to Blacksburg Va. where my faithful caving
companion Glen 'Rubberlegs! Davis, his sidekick Jette Feduska, and
I descended upon the previously serené household of Gary "The Yo-YÓ!
Moss.?
Our arrival was greeted with the usual shocked dismay; animated
threats, and curses, but Gary eventually resigned himself to his
fate. A lengthy alcoholic discussion followed: I wanted a deep
drop with a sharply defined lip which would enable me to shoot
vertically down the pit. In addition, the pit should be relatively
accessible from the surface...because nobody would particularly
enjoy spending most of their caving time dragging bags, boxes, and
crates of equipment to and from the drop.2 Past photo trips had
taught me (and my friends.) that it took hours to set up and shoot
a good series of cave pictures; and being both cowardly) and lazy,
I had no desire to push the limits of patience or endurance.
Besides, I was rapidly running out of friends.
Gary, the experienced vertical-type among us, thought of
several spectacular drops in nearby caves, but, recalling our levels
of competence,, wisely rejected them. At last we decided upon
Bill's Rappel,4 a nifty 160-foot drop in the Newberry's section of
the Newberry-Banes cave system north of Dublin, Va. It was a clean
drop along one vertical wall and could be reached in less than an
hour from the surface. We set off amid dreams of fame and fortune,
and Gary's grumblings.
The cave formed along a series of fissures, and, as we entered,
the passages formed a twisting, sloping descent on a talus floor.:
Soon, the passage ended in a keyway 15 feet above the floor of the
Balcony Room. Gary rummaged in one of our packs and produced a
cable ladder. After rigging the ladder and a piece of Bluewater,
we rappelled the drop into the Balcony Room.
The Balcony Room is roughly cylindrical; 40 feet high and 50
feet in diameter. The keyway we had entered from Occupied the
center of one wall; the opposite wall was climbable all the way to .
the ceiling, and several flat ledges lay along the route. These
ledges were splendid vantage points to view the entire room,
people descending the cable ladder, and the drop of Bill;s Rappel
itself, which occupied easily half of the floor area. The talus
and breakdown floor of the room stretched up to the edge of the
drop.. The loose consistency of the floor material kept us from
venturing close to the edge.
