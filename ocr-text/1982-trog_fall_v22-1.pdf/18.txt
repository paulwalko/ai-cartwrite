STARNES GOES
Since my last report on Starnes, we've found a lot more virgin
passage. One of the thirty foot high leads at the end of the main
trunk yielded almost 3001. Ed Devine once again brought in his
infamous scaling pole. While Jean Simonds and I continued mapping a
fifteen foot high lead nearby, Ed, John Lohner, Donnie Carter and
Diane Dlugos went up the virgin lead.
The scaling pole was made up of three foot long aluminum angle
bolted together with brackets. A cable ladder, belay line and two
tag lines were connected to the top of the pole before it was raised
and braced. After the tag lines were secured, a two man test on the
then vertical cable ladder readied it for use. The first man up
was on bottom belay through a pulley and once up, he top belayed
everyone else.
They found a ten foot square passage disappearing upslope over
large active limestone dams and flowstone terraces. While Jean and
I were squeezing through tight miserable crawl and getting mud up
our noses, they were running up this virgin lead like crazy people.
The passage continued up about two hundred feet before it hit the top
of the limestone layer and became breakdown. A single crawl through
the boulders brought them over a fifteen foot blind pit. Forty feet
further on they came to the top of a twenty five foot pit. Having
no further rigging they had to turn around. The high lead Jean and
I were in finally ended with about 300' of passage. It had been
previously explored.
A few weeks later, I went back with John Lohner, Dave Cinsavich,
and Scott Poole to do the virgin pit. John had left the drop rigged
with a loop of sling so after pulling up a ladder, I went up and top
belayed everyone else. After stepping carefully around the rimstone
dams and webbing, climbing, and crawling, we got to the top of the
drop. I rigged a ladder to a projection on a ledge and John descended.
A single crawlway was found, tight and sharp with popcorn. Ten
minutes later, John emerged from the hole with clothes ripped, skin
bleeding, and language regressing (why do you think I sent him!).
It didn't go.
In the middle of July, I took Kenny Bonenberger and a very hung
over Ed Fortney in to do the thirty five foot drop with a thirty foot.
cable ladder in a lower section of the cave. During the course of
mapping one stream crawl, Ed named it the 'Birth Canal.' It
perfectly recreated the invet, slippery, tight sensation of what birth
must have felt like. At the end of it was the 'Womb Room' with the
stream dropping out of a fifteen foot high lead. Since Wilburn
Valley (where Starnes is located) has very little surface drainage,
there may well be a main trunk stream yet undiscovered. The 'Womb
Room! stream may be the best lead to that main trunk.
Another passage was found, the 'Belly Flop ?. A body size crawl
several inches deep in mud went downhill and around a corner. The
passage had standing water half filling it and the air flow was almost
violent, but we decided to save it for later on when we were already
cold. So far it hasn't been pushed. It took me five minutes to slip
and slide backwards and uphill out of the twenty foot crawl.
