The New River Valley, situated in the remote mountainous zone
of Southwest Virgina, had remained isolated from the evolution of
the rest of the planet. The rough, steep, and arid karst zone had
created a distinctive fauna. The homo sapiens left. their above
ground environment ages ago in favor of a better lifestyle underground.
They evolved into troglodytes, perusers of the miles of cave
passages found in the area. This mysterious group of creatures,
after centuries devoid of contact with the outside world, now have .
à chance to unravell their story... buckle up and hold onto your
teeth...Oh No!! It's thene.

Our story this issue starts with' VPI troglodytes at Richard
Cobb.!s house for the 4th of July party. Unfortunately, .25% of the
cavers remaining in Blacksburg that weekend separated their ankle.
Another successful summer party was Russ Peterson's annual August
orgy.
Bernie gave a bar-busting party in September and gave his
liquor stash away to the hungry wolves. He's now in Germany.
: : Quiche Smith had an "Ön Belay" party where everyone had to
wear a rappelling seat and be firmly attached to an anchor point in
his apartment. Entrance to his balcony was' via cable ladder. Jim
Jones got confused and went, up the ladder upside-down. Glen Davis
had the evil "belay hook."
.::;-OTR was once again a good weekend (every body told me I had a
good time). Taking awards in the Speleo Olympics was Dennis Vaders
(2nd overall), Chuck Shorten (3rd overall, PRP, Combination Climb,
bowline tie), Don Anderson (cave pack), Maureen Handler (women's
overall), Sue Haezel:(2nd on women's mechanical climb). : All won
attractive plaques which were designed and made by Chris Amundson
and Pat Shorten. Friday afternoon was the first annual "More ..
liquor" party. Sunday's infamous "more wine" party resulted in a
battle field of dead soldiers, dead cavers, and Ben Keller and
Philip Balister, who drank wine spiked with moonshine and Red Lady 21 ;.
Everyone enjoyed seeing each other puke their guts out. Far from
the smell of vomit around the VPI canopy, was the sauna, where even
Hugh "least likely to get laid" Beard couldn't score. During sober
moments that weekend, Buckwheat and Co. were at Seneca Rocks, the
Shorten's and Co. were hiking along Otter Creek, and Gary Rouse
and Ed Devine went exploring "unusual holes". Jerry Redder took all
the young rug rats caving and was thanked by being bombarded by
Water ballons. Maureen, Vikki, and friends started a chaotic muda
wrestling bout and Don Anderson was thrown into the horrible mire
by some 'friends' that he hadn't seen in 15 years. Not to be out
done, Dave Cinsavich and Ben Keller went glass wrestling. .
Don Davidson and Cheryl Jones. came all the way from Oman for this?
Jim Jones, alias Steve Smith, made an entrance into the campground
with his ruthless two man motorcycle gang.
Other events this quarter: Pete and Linda Sauvigne bundled up
their kids and dog into their urban assault vehicle and moved to
Rockhill, SC. Mike and Susan Moore moved to Richmond. Wayne Burstein
got married. Glen Davis has a case of champagne (dwindling) from
