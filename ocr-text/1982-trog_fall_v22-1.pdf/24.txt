Recipe for a Rope Litter
Have you ever been in the situation where you need to
carry your friend around and just can't think of how you are
going to do it? Well, if you just happen to have 160.1 of rope
lying around, here is a neat little recipe for making a rope
litter. An advantage is that the knots can be made while you
are standing up and in a crouded spot. A big flat area is not
required for laying out the litter. The Olympia Mountaineers
have uses this litter in their leadership practices for the
past three years and have found it simple and fast to make.
WA
: 1. Begin with a rope and find
the middle or nearly so. Make
a loop like a letter 'e'one
fist length away from the center
of the rope.
..2. Make a second loop like a
letter 'e' over top of the first
1. loop.
3. - Stick the bight of the rope
up through the loops.
4. Tighten the knot by pulling
toward the center of the rope.
5.. TWO fist lengths away from
the first knot, repeat the knot.
6. This should make your knots
about 20 inches apart. Vary
the fist length or the size of
the loops to get 20 inches.
7. Make 10 knots down one side of
the rope, and another 10 knots
down the other side of the rope..
If you are working with a partner,.
he can be making the knots on
2. the second side at the same time.
If he is right-handed, it helps
to have him stand inside the bight
of the rope while he ties the
knots.
.8. Starting with the middle of
the rope, criss-cross the knots.
9. When all of the knots have
been crossed, thread the ends of
the rope down the knots. How
close knots are together is
determined by the height of the
victim. The stretcher should be
slightly longer than victim.
