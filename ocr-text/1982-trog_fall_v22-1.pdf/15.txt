At last, one of the real Cosmic Truths of Cave Photography
had been graphically illustrated in two trips of useless pictures:
Through practice, I can hold still for fairly long periods, but
People Invariably Move. All exposures containing people would have
to be done in a single shot: the super flashbulbs would help in
this regard, since a single bulb would reach the distances
involved, and there would be no delay for reloading a bulbor
waiting for the strobe to recycle.
Once again Glen and I descended upon Blacksburg. We dragged
Gary, kicking and screaming, from his apartment: his roommate,
Skip Whitehurst, came along to watch the fun. We were joined by
Jim Hammil and his buddy George. What a crew! Half a dozen native
bearers laden with camera gear, ropes, rations... just like in
National Geographic. Wow!
We didn't waste any time: we rigged the main drop (Bill's
Rappel), my two safety lines, and this time a fourth line to
support the camera and tripod. I had discovered that I could
extend and spread two legs of the tripod and, by tying a light
rope at the point where the camera attached to the tripod, have a.
stable, three point suspension.
Soon all was in readiness; the Alpa (loaded with Pantaomic-X
film.. this time if it was a poor image I would try to save it in
the darkroom) was prefocused at infinity, aimed down the drop, and
stable on its two legs and nylon line. I was settled on the ledge
with a rubber bulb type pneumatic cable release and a flashbulb
socket stuck on the end of a piece of coat hanger wire.
Gary, as usual, was the first man over the side. He was carrying
a pack full of flashbulbs, bulb sockets, batteries and connection
wires. Dangling from his belt was the Graflex flashgun loaded with
a number 3 bulb. He rappelled down 40 feet, steadied himself against
the wall and announced that he was ready. He aimed the flash down;
in its reflector it would illuminate the walls and floor of the drop.
my bare flashbulb from above would illuminate him and the upper
parts of the drop.
Gary had never seen one of the bulbs go off and he was a little
scared of the thing. I opened the shutter and yelled "Fire."
Gary closed his eyes and pushed the button.
... The whole world lit up!
It was beautiful! I fired my bulb when I saw the light from
his bulb, closed the shutter and grinned like Hell. . called it
"Moss' Long Shot."
That was just the beginning. Once on the bottom, Gary loaded
two bulbs and positioned himself directly below Skip Whitehurst, his
roommate, who was the next to descent. With his Wheat lamp, Gary .
could see the camera's position at the top of the drop and placed the
flash so that its light would be eclipsed by Skip's body, resulting
in a silhouette. Two bulbs were used, one aimed upward in the
reflector to illuminate the upper walls, the other open bulb to light
up the floor and lower walls. I called the shot "The Whitehurst
Variation on Bill's Rappel."
When Jim Hammil was rappelling, Gary and Skip fired bare bulbs
from opposite ends of the floor, and I added a third from above with
my socket-on-a-wire. This shot showed off the drop to its best...I
