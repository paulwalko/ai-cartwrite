The next weekend, John Lohner and Pan Neiser went with me. to.
attempt to finish all the entrance leads. While still in sight of
entrance light, we took a side passage which led to a twenty five
foot drop. After. descending a ladder I rigged and sliding down a
steep slope. I found myself in a forty foot diameter room with a
sixty foot ceiling. I was then fifty feet below the top of the drop.
A stream coming from one wall, around the room and back into the same
wall explained the dubbed name, the 'Horseshoe Stream' room.
C. The stream entered the room through breakdown and definetly
looked virgin! After prolonged conning, Pam finally agreed to do :
it. The chute, later named the Ascending Colon, went up at a 450
angle, was body sized, had numerous loos rocks, and was half
filled with the chilling stream. Twenty feet later, Pam yelled down
for us. After waiting for John to enlarge it for himself (and me),
we joined Pam in virgin passage. The next room after the first
twenty foot diameter one, had the stream coming out of a two inch by
twenty foot slot in the ceiling. Bummer! However, to make things
interesting, at the top of the opposite slope sat a perfectly
round five foot diameter rock that: looked, for all the world, like
it would come crashing down. : This room became of course, the
"Temple of the Sun' room from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Two more :
rooms and a small fissure remained to be mapped and we were
finished:
The first week in August, Kenny Bonenberger and Mike FÃºtrell
joined me to finish all the entrance leads. One of these was.
Pack Rat Run' on the east side of the entrance slope. Another was
a tie in for a 350! loop. The rest of the trip was finishing:
miscellaneous leads.
1: The total number of mapping trips is now twelve, . The passage
length is up to 1.43 miles and still going. Six virgin high.leads,
a whole section beneath a sixty foot waterfall drop, and one or two
dozen crawls remain to be explored and mapped. The cave goes on!!
