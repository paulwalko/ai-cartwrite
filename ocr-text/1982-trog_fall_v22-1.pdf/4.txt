FROM THE EDITORS
If you're wondering why your TROG seems lighter than usual,
don't worry that we went to much expense to get space-age, ultra-
thin paper at the printshop, We didn't. Despite our incessant
pleading for articles and actual threats of bodily harm to anyone
who refused to write, well, we think we did the best we could with
what wÄ™ got. Enjoy...
Much thanks, as usual, goes to those who did help us out with
artwork and articles, and also to the TROG party staff. We probably
could have done it without you, but it wouldn't have been as much fun.
Um, our topic for discussion this quarter is cave conservation,
eh, beauty! There are some very wealthy and prominent caving
organizations in Virginia who seem to feel that the only way to
preserve any cave worth going into is to limit access with a gate.
We have a vehement objection to this philosophy.
First is the problem of access. Gates serve to keep out the
riff-raff, the wildlife, and even the occasional competent caver
who just doesn't happen to have a key. Many of us fit in the latter
category. We respect and admire the people who gate caves with
rare and fragile formations in heavy traffic areas. Also the people
who genuinely believe that their gates protect endangered species
and historical or palaeontological artifacts.
But there are caves in Virginia for which we can't figure out
why the gates are there. So that the landowner isn't bothered?
Fear of injury? Spite? Power? Come on, this is serious.
Gates on unnecessarily gated caves serve two purposes: to
harrass and infuriate responsible cavers and to tantalize those who
are not so responsible. Put yourself in the boots of a non-organized
caver or an unenlightened organized caver who encounters a gate for
the first time in a cave he has been to before. Then put yourself
in the tennis shoes of the local nerd cavers who find a breeched
gate for the first time. Add to this the fact that the responsible
cavers don't have a key or don't go to the cave very often, due to
access problems.
The result? Disaster, most probably. One solution would be to
give keys to the grottoes, but our favorite is simply to stop the
gating of sport caves.
