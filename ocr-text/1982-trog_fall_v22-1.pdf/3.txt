STYMIE SPEAKS!
With the onset of Fall quarter, the VPI cave club found itself
suffering the wrath of the college of Agriculture. We were booted
out of Smyth 146 by Assoc. Dean Boyd, who contended that we had been
a problem for 13 years.' Though we offered as much resistance as
possible, we were forced to move our meetings across campus to Pamplin
76. However, the relocation appears to have had little adverse effect
on the drive to acquire prospective members. At the time of this
writing; the club has an all time high of 47 prospective members!
President-of-Vice, Keith Smith, with the help of Capt. Ed Fortney, held
Vertical training sessions on the Ag-E bridge every Friday afternoon
throughout the fall, They also initiated many Wednesday night
drinking sessions at the Hokie House to allow members and trainees to
socialize and discuss caving activities. Without a doubt, Keith's
and Ed's efforts are largely responsible for this fall's successful
recruitment of prospective members. In addition to the Friday
vertical sessions, Lawrence Britt supervised a rescue rigging session
at Pighole to allow new cavers to learn and practice rigging :
techniques.
In the summer and early, fall, the club boosted landowner relations
when we undertook a fence building project in Skydusky Hollow. We
constructed a 1500 foot long fence between Buddy Penley's property
and Mrs. H. A. Banes' property to show our appreciation for their
letting us, as well as cavers from other areas and grottos, use
their land and caves.
Another highlight of the fall was the cave club's involvement in
the Miller Recycling Campaign. Many thanks to Kent Thompson for all
of the time and effort he spent to bring a first place prize to the
club, along with the satisfaction of beating all of the frats.
And of course, as usual, we did lots of caving this fall. . This
winter, I expect, we'll do even more caving! There is going to be a
practice rescue in January. We are also going to make a concentrated
effort to boost interest in cave surveying. When we have our ridge
walk in February, hopefully many club cavers will become involved in
the mapping of the caves we find. Afterall, the reason for having
the ridgewalk is to find and survey new caves and to get VPI cavers
involved in a project that we can work on together.
So it looks like we are going to have a good winter to top off
a great fall! I'm really looking forward to working with everyone
on the practice rescue and the ridgewalk, and I think everyone who
gets involved will enjoy their experiences.
Keep On Caving!
