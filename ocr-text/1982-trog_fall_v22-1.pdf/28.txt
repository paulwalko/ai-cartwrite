STRENGTH TESTS OF LONGITUDINAL VERSUS LATERAL
SEWING IN 1" TUBULAR NYLON WEBBING
A subject of debate amongst cavers who like to hand sew their
caving gear with awl and heavy nylon thread is the matter of which
direction or pattern of sewing is the strongest. The following .
tests actually developed out of another common argument which is
the relative strength of a knot verses sewing in tubular webbing.
The desire to test these runners came about after one Bill Stephens
refused to use my sewn runners in lieu of supposedly stronger
knotted runners. The specimens tested are known in the climbing
community as "quick-draws" or "rabbit runners"(the commericial
name used by Forrest Mountaineering Inc.). Their popularity is due
to the fact that they can easily be removed. quickly from the "rack"
when hanging precariously, they can be used either doubled over or
stretched out completely., and they cut down on the amount of sling
needed to produce a runner. The use of webbing in this confiquration
does not have much application in SRT directly but it provides
a nice test specimen for the kinds of sewing that is used in vertical
caving equipment.
With the gracious help of Bob Simonds who provided lab as-
sistance and the master craftsmen John Lohner who sewed the spec-
imens, the following results were found.
