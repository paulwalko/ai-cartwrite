illuminate the walls of the drop and one bulb aimed upward to
silhouette Don on the rope. Several variations of this set up
were tried for as long as Don could remain suspended in mid-rappel.
When he finished his descent, Gary rappelled down and took up his
old position.
Eventually Glen, too, became tired and finished his rappel.
I had shot a dozen slides or so (Kodachrome 25 film), so I packed
up my cameras and stuff and rappelled down to meet the others.
Once at the bottom, we convinced Gary to prussik back up carrying
the Honeywell strobe, and to stop every 20 feet or so and flash the
walls. I would take a single time exposure of the entire ascent.
I also shot several pictures of him as he began his climb, and after
the successful ascent, I tried to light the entire drop from below
by firing a dozen bulbs in succession. (The picture didn't work,
but I did have a flashbulb explode-a real thrill! It blew
incandescent glass 40 feet in all directions. I'm glad I wasn't
shooting someone's portrait. I never trusted those bulbs again,
and I have since had two more explode.)
Gary, at the top of the drop, began to pack up the ropes while
the rest of us climbed the twisting Devil's Staricase, a nasty
little path that leads to the topmost ledge overlooking the Balcony
Room. Once there, we packed up and headed for the surface. We
had been under for 1.3 hours.
Back home in the Big City, I gave my precious film to Kodak
and held my breath. But the slides were useless... even with the
multiple flashes, too little light had been used. And the pit.
shots were all blurred: While lying on the tripod, my breathing,
heartbeat, and nervous tremors had shaken the camera. I was not
happy.
Since everything that could have gone wrong had gone wrong, I
decided that the next (final) trip would be flawless.
For the last trip, I decided to be totally prepared. I tested
the flashbulbs by shooting a test roll of black and white outside
my apartment building one night, and found that my estimates of
distances were horribly inaccurate. Furthermore, the FP flashbulbs
were only as powerful
as the Honeywell strobe
(ASA 25 guide number
80). I remedied that
at my friendly
neighborhood photo
store: the biggest
flashbulb made is
number 3, the size of a hig
200-watt screw in light on
bulb...in a reflector,
it has the ASA 25 guide
number of 280! SHAZAM!
I bought a dozen.
With limited
number of flashes
available, I set up a
shooting schedule
(just like Hollywood)
of what shots would
require what equipment,
and who would be needed
