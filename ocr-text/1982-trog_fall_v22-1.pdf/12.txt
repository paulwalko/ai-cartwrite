Glen and Gary
rigged the drop from a
hidden corner of the
room, behind several
large boulders where
the floor was free of
debris. I scampered
around the room
taking pictures of the
cable ladder, the key
way, etc. I managed
to induce Garys to
climb the ladder for
a few action shots.
He was magnificient,
but the photographic
results were dismal.
On this first
trip, I was carrying
minimal camera gear,
since I didn't expect
to get perfect results
the first time out
with standard
equipment. I was
carrying one 50
caliber ammo box (the
standard of most cave
photographers) with my
Alpa 35mm camera, its
50mm macro lens, a
trusty Gitzo tripod,
and two flash units;
a Honeywell 770 for a
main light, and a
Vivitar 102 with a
photocell slave as a
fill light.
We all rappelled
the 160, did a brief
"bit of sightseeing
in the lower passages,
then ascended to the :
surface and sought
food and strong drink.
The photographs from the first foray
. The Abyss
werÃ« dull and dark; reflecting, in my learned
opinion, a general lack of planning and an over-enthusiam in my trigger
finger. Even so, the first trip was invaluable in teaching us the
layout of the drop, difficulties to be encountered, etc. It was a
learning experience. Next time we would be ready
Several weekends. later I reported on the failure of the first
pictures and reappeared on Gary's doorstep with several extra,
weighty sacks of equipment. To the original' ammo box' had been added
a second box with a Cannon Ft camera .with a 28mm wide angle lens, a
Graflex flash gun, and five dozen flashbulbs.
