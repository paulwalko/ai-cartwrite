Before beginning our journey we ÅŸought the company, expertise,
and carrying capacity of Don Anderson', who had, in a moment of
deranged murmuring, asked to participate in a cave photo trip.
Since he was the most enthusiastic (i.e. least familiar with this
sort of foolishness) member of the trip, we gave him most of the
equipment to carry.8
With Don, but without Jette, we returned to the Balcony Room,
rigged the drop, and began taking pictures.
One shot involved someone (Gary) standing at the edge of the
drop, rigged onto the rope as if beginning the rappel. This was
staged in the beginning with Glen and Don, on different ledges of
the far wall, firing the Honeywell and Graflex flashes. The distances
from the flashers to Gary averaged 50 feet so it took several
flashes from each person to properly illuminate the scene. It was
a good try.
The results were good, but not salon material. In the 15
seconds that it took for the light men to recharge and reload,
Gary's helmet lamp had moved an inch or so and left a smear on the
negative instead of a sharp point.
This trip I ignored the Balcony Room itself and concentrated
on the drop. Since I sought a picture looking straight down the
drop, the camera would have to be somewhere over the drop, and over
the rope. The edge of the pit where the rope went over was a
ledge. varying between 6 inches and 2 feet wide. I would, of
necessity, have to be sitting on this ledge operating the camera
as the others in the party clambered over my frightened cadaver
and descended to be photographed.
These plans are easily concocted on paper at home, beer-in-hand.
But there on the ledge, problems arose:
1. I have a fear of heights, inspired by a driving ambition
to reach a Ripe Old Age.
2. Being dead is no fun. And,
3. My eternal resting place (where all cavers will be
reunited in one great old Timers Reunion) is saving me a warm place
by the Fire, and although my trip there is assured, I have no
desire to commence my journey at 32 ft/secz.
Gary and Glen rigged a safety line (two separate lines, really)
which I tied into using a seat sling and a cam. Then I crawled
down onto the ledge and cautiously nosed over the edge... there
was a slight bulge to the wall below me, so I would have to extend
the camera outward away from the wall in order to get a clear shot
of the drop.
I used my tripod as a boom, extending the legs and center
column and keeping the legs together. To brace this boom I discovered.
that I had to isandbag' the legs with some large, heavy mass...so . .
I lay down across it. I adjusted the camera so that it was aimed
downward, picked up a good aperture (f. 4.0), set the shutter on:
'B' (Bulb, for time exposure) and Gary climbed over me and rappelled
into the pit.
When Gary reached bottom he unpacked a bag containing the
Graflex flash gun and several quarts of flashbulbs and prepared
to illuminate Don, who would be the next person down.
Don rigged in and rappelled down about 50 feet, stopped, and
got comfortable. Several shouted messages later, we knew that Gary
was ready at the bottom, so I opened the shutter with a long cable
release and yelled "Fire!". Gary fired several bulbs aimed to
