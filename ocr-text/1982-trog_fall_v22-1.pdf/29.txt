* Assumes manufacturer's suggested ultimate strength of unknotted,
unsewn webbing as 4000 lbs.
As can be seen, sewing parallel to the load direction is
stronger in all cases than sewing perpendicular to load application.
Even the bare minimum of 1 inch of longitudinal s'ewing. The only
commercially sewn runner is the so called "rabbit runner".. sold by
Forrest, The Forrest runner uses perpendicular sewing with a very
thin nylon thread sewn extremely tightly packed. The manufacturer
claims a strength of 3000 lbs. for this type of lateral sewing
which is probably accurate considering the higher stitch density
of commercial sewing. Considering the exorbitant price of commer-
icially sewn runners, and considering that 3 inchs of longitudinal
sewing are still very applicable to climbing and caving use. The
important point is not to duplicate the lateral sewing pattern
used commercially with your hand awl; you simply can't get the
stitches dense enough to imitate the commercial job.
Out of curosity we also tested the strength of the eye' splice
in tenstron as commonly used to make prussik knots... As expected,
the splice did not fail; being stronger than the tenstron itself :
which failed at 1950 lbs. The specimens were all connected to the
testing machine with Bonaiti steel non-backing oval carabiers
to obtain a realistic bend in the sling loop. During the first
test however one of the carabiners failed at a load not much higher
than stamped on the carabiner as the factory test value! The
carabiner failed where the gate clips into the frame ( the opposite
end of the gate from the gate hinge) by shearing out of the frame.
For those who still may be paranoid about sewing your own
runners, a suggestion by Richard Cobb is the sewing in zig-zag
patterns 45° to load direction. This should be stronger than even
longitudinal sewing but of course will take much more time and effort.
