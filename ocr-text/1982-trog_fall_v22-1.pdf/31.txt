§ 10-150.11. Findings and policy.-The General Assembly hereby finds that caves are
uncommon geologic phenomena, and that the minerals deposited therein may be rare and
occur in unique forms of great beauty which are irreplaceable if destroyed. Also

historic value. It is further found that the organisms which live in caves are unusual and
of limited numbers; that many are rare and endangered species, and that caves are a
natural conduit for groundwater flow and are highly subject to water pollution, thus
having far-reaching effects transcending man's property boundaries. It is therefore declared
