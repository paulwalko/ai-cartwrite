From the Sign-Out Sheet
Since the last printing of the TROG in the Spring, the VPI cave
club has logged 3963 man hours underground through 1.1/21/82.
This gives us approximately 660 man hours a month again making
us one of the most active grottoes in the world. Keep up the
good caving and remember---safety first.
