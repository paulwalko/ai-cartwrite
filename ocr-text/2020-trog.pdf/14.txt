A Virginia Caver's First Year in Texas
or
Cavers are the Same Everywhere, I Don't Know Why /

Excluding the last nine months, the New River Valley has been my home since I was
seven years old, and I have been a VPI caver during the entirety of my time at Tech. When |
moved to Austin last June, I left two families behind.
Within just a few weeks of moving in, I had found and started attending the meetings of
Austin's UT Grotto. I was welcomed in despite joining at a particularly hard time for the Grotto,
which had recently lost several of its oldest and best-loved members. It was a comforting
surprise to find that a lot of cavers here knew cavers from back home (most specifically Reilly
Blackwell, you seem to have made a very good impression on a lot of people). As the University
of Texas is no longer officially affiliated with the UT Grotto (today that stands for “Underground
Texas”), very few of the members are students, but the group still has plenty of young adults
and an excellent set of annual social events. On the Fourth of July, just weeks after I had
moved, the grotto put together a flotilla of kayaks and canoes to watch fireworks from the river
that runs through the heart of downtown Austin. We got two shows for the price of one, as 1.5
million Mexican Freetail bats poured into the evening sky out of South Congress Bridge around
sunset. Drew Thompson and Patty Calabrese graciously loaned me a kayak, and watching the
lights of the city and the fireworks mix together in their reflection on the Colorado river, I felt like I
had found a group and place where I would be happy. Over the months since then, I've met
many delightful cavers of all degrees of intensity, and generally enjoyed my life here in Austin.
Another VPI caver (Naomi Orndorff) has also moved to Austin, and several more have passed
through
The actual caving around Austin is significantly different from what we have around
Blacksburg, and the caving in Texas at large is very different than the caving in Austin. West
Texas has stunningly decorated caves with large passages, sometimes formed by dissolution
not with carbonic acid from rainwater, but instead geologically sourced sulfuric acid. This
creates incredible speleothems unlike the ones in Virginia. West Texas is a long way from
Austin though, and most of the caving I have done since moving here has been within the City
of Austin itself. The city contains dozens and dozens of caves, and while most are closed to the
public either through gating or location, the UT grotto has access to many. Most of the passage
is small and dry, and the chert is white instead of black. The land is beautiful and covered with a
mix of low oak trees, cedars, and cacti. Cave entrances often have Texas persimmon trees
growing nearby with their sweet, juicy black fruit hot in the sun as a post-cave snack. The
