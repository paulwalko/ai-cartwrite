A Letter From the President
Greetings ladies, gentlemen, and cavers,
It has been an eventful and memorable year for VPI. We hit the (under)ground running
over the summer by receiving a handsome sum of money from the Town for the role of Trash
Police TM at their Summer Solstice Festival. We were so good at collecting garbage for pay that
you'd almost think we had past experience. Now down to the real dirty stuff...
After only a mere 6 months (+/- 2) of saying we would, we gussied ourselves up and got
down to business building a new fence at Clover Hollow. 200 feet of blood, sweat, and
strategically placed subsurface rocks made real men out of the lot of us. If that wasn't enough
physical labor in the cold to scare people off, we got a lot of people surveying for the first time!
Granted, part of the pull was some colorful advertisement of WVACS weekends and the
promise of Windy Mouth virgin passage, but many trainees agree the real reward was the
splendor of their first WVACS Cave trip!
Speaking of real rewards, for the first time in known history, a Club meeting was hosted
at the London Underground. Now that the old farts are aware that it is possible for the meeting
to come to them, they have insisted on permanent relocation so they can drink and heckle from
the familiar comfort of their second home. Of course, the Club as a whole has gotten a taste of
the forbidden fruit, that is, drunken home Zoom meetings. Human White Nose (COVID-19)
struck with a force following Spring Break and suspending meetings, caving, and Club events
for the remainder of the school year. While this is tragic, it is only fair that the bats get their
revenge and we stay inside to practice our table traverses in order to properly challenge Nittany
Grotto when the time comes.
Zoom meetings were not the only time cavers were caught on film this year. In fact,
many distinguished members and trainees were selected to participate in a live reading of Pulp
Fiction. Our audition tape has been sent to all the major networks and a contract is currently
pending for a reenactment of Cats. Muchas gracias to Elvis Grotto TM for their role in a
continuing legacy of cavers on the big screen.
It has been my honor and privilege to serve y'all this year, and thank you for making it
such a successful one. An additional thank you goes out to Nathan Kearney, Meredith Blanco,
and Rowan Berman. I only look so good at my job because of all y'all do to support me. To all
the trainees who have not gotten their membership, git on it. To those of you that finally did,
congratulations, now please start heckling the aforementioned group so we can see another 77
years.
Sincerely Yours,
Jaren Woelk
