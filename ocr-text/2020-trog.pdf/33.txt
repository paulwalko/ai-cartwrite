into the upper level which turns out to be a tube 30 feet wide! To the right it goes 2hx20w, but Matt heads left towards Mandy’s ramp. He traverses around two scary pits that drop into the lower passage to reach the top of the ramp. Mandy is inspired to make a second attempt and manages to stem her way past a particularly scary block to reach the gentler slope leading up to Matt. The passage is 50 feet wide up here and heads northwest to another pit that looks climbable (well maybe). Across the second pit the passage continues 10hx20w heading into the ridge!
We are out of time at this point and leave the booty for next time.
We exited the cave at 10 PM for an 11.5 hour trip.
This was Matt’s first caving trip and he had a great time and got to participate in a discovery of major virgin passage – I think he is hooked.
Work Remaining:
N7 - 5Wx2H BD crawl partway up climb between N7 and N8 – 10 ft to BD hole going up into black space that lies north of the known upper level passage.
N23 – Paleo-upstream canyon 8hx5w, good air movement, 100 feet plus, dirt floor, heading northeast.
N18 – Across slope to right and up hole in breakdown, upper-level tube 2hx20w, unexplored. Air?
N19 – Upper level tube 10hx50w northwest to pit then 10hx20w. Ties back to N18 also
N20 – Drain to southwest, 2.5hx5w, heading toward J42 dome
N20 – Paleo drain to southwest, up on ledge 10 feet above active drain, obscured by breakdown. Need to traverse ledge to check it out
