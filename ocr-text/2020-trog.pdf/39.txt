In my experience, the two knot ascension system had the following
advantages over the three knot system:
• Required less rope
• Used fewer knots
• Was easier to ascend. Since both knots were above my waist, I could slide my top knot up
and bring my hand down just above my waist to slide my bottom knot up. Conversely, in a
three knot system, you have to bend down to your knees, grip the rope underneath both
your bottom knots with one hand and slide them up with your other hand.
• Had a second attachment point to my harness. This is perhaps the greatest advantage
since I didn't have to worry about getting into a heel hang. Also, falling into a heel hang
could easily result in hitting your head on the ground if you are not high up the rope or on
other cave features if it is not a free climb. Additionally, getting caught on your harness
would be less of a shock load on your bottom knot. Shock loading friction hitches creates a
lot of nylon on nylon friction, which can fuse the rope in excess.
• Was easier to change over. Since both knots are above your waist, you can attach the
descender below both of your knots when changing over from ascending to rappeling. In a
three knot system, you would attach your descender below your top knot but above your
bottom two knots, which requires you to slide your bottom knots down a ways in order to
have enough slack to attach your descender. Also, some descenders like the figure eight
and the rack without a hyperbar require tying an overhand knot above the device for a hard
lockoff, which can be pulled undone if you pull the rope below the device, which happens
when stepping into your bottom knots to unweight your top knot. Changing over from
rappeling to ascending is also easier for similar reasons.
In fact, I found the taxas kick even has some advantages over the frog system too:
• No chest harness is required.
• You are not forced to be snug against the rope, which gives you greater mobility and is
particularly useful for technical rope maneuvers, topping out, and going over lips. However,
some people may prefer being tight against the rope.
• It doesn't require rope weight to work smoothly.
• I find it easier to slide top ascenders and knots that are above me. Sometimes the chest
ascender doesn't slide up, particularly when there is little rope weight.
