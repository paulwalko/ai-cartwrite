Best Cave Accident Reports by John Fruhauf
By John Fruhauf, VPI #486
These are some of my favorite cave accident reports I have read this year. All these stories
were transcribed by me which took some time because the text was pdfs. Lots can be learned
from reading these accident reports. Everyone cave safe, have fun, and stay healthy.
Book 1: American Caving Accidents 1967-1970
Pennsylvania, Carnegie Cave, 1967: On Sunday, 9 July, Jerry Kyle (16), Charles Richter (16),
and Nancy Vanderlafske visited Carnegie Cave. All were inexperienced, only Kyle having been
caving a few times previously.
The entrance to Carnegie is a 36-inch, tar lined drain pipe, 150 feet long, passing under
Interstate 81. The three met another group of notice cavers coming out of the cave when they
arrived. Someone from this group, whose ages ranged from 15 to 20 years, left two candles
burning in the middle of the drain pipe.
The three passed the candles on their way through the conduit without disturbing them,
but it is possible that one of the party could have kicked over one or both of the candles upon
entering the cave. Approximately 15 minutes later they started to return and smelled smoke.
Upon reaching the conduit the group saw a wall of fire blazing before them in their only avenue
of escape from the cave.
Richter became terrorized and started crawling through the pipe into the flames. He
continued on and out the conduit despite Kyle and Vanderlafske shouting and warning him not
to go. A nearby resident saw black smoke pouring from the pipe, and then Richter emerged and
fell to the ground, his clothes on fire. The local police and fire departments arrived quickly and
Richter was rushed to a hospital.
Meanwhile, the other two retreated as far back into the main part of the cave as possible,
to await help. About three hours later, the fire had burned itself out, firemen, and cavers who
had been to the scene, found the two safe and brought them out.
Richter died three days later from second and third degree burns over 59% of his body.

Analysis: The accident seems improbable, but there have actually been numerous caving
accidents due to fire fed by dumped fuels, escaping acetylene, etc. It is possible that if an older
and/or more experienced person had been present, Richter could have been stopped from
entering the fire.
West Virginia, Overholt Blowing Cave, 1967: At about 3 p.m. on Saturday February, Ralph
Bucca (20) and Jon Lock (19) commenced an exploration in Overholt Blowing Cave. In mid
