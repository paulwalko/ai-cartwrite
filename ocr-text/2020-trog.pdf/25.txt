about 900ft (~274m) down the first passage and then another 800ft (~244m) through the Windy Stoop with even more crawling afterwards. Moral of the story for all of the trainees that happen to read this at picnic, or by some chance years after, unless you enjoy not having any feeling in your knees for like three days afterwards it would be in your best interest to just buy some damn knee pads. Any industrial hard cover ones work well, but I prefer volleyball knee pads just because they are a lot more flexible and have just as good of cushioning as the former. It also saves you the hassle of trying to create innovative ways to crawl around that do not involve being on all fours, although depending on what you come up with it may actually be useful and amusing for other individuals on your trip.
1Refer to “Thing’s I’ve Learned in TAG” article by Matthew Kok in this troglodyte, good read. 2If you are a member this should be self-explanatory. If you are a trainee, ask a member.
