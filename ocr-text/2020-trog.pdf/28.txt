Biographies are the best histories. Here is mine. Where is yours?
I was born a Redneck Doctor’s Daughter in Richmond, Virginia on July 11, 1951. Young Robyn LeFon liked dirt and water. She also loved horses. While in High School, I attended a Fundamentalist Baptist Church. When I decided to attend Virginia Polytechnic Institute (VPI), the Preacher told me, “If you go to that school, you are going to Hell.”
In September, 1969, I found the VPI Cave Club. My first cave was New River. Bill Douty led the trip. Bill called me,”a typical girl caver.” I took it as a challenge and learned to be a VPI Caver. I became VPI #138 In April, 1970. I did all kinds of caving: vertical, horizontal, sport and mapping. I lit my way with a carbide lamp. I rappelled with double break bars attached to a Swiss seat. I climbed rope with knots.
Cavers never date. They just get together, stay together or split up. I became Mrs. Ed Loud in June, 1973. I had a new B.S. in Biology and worked in the Biology Department at VPI for four years. In 1977, I decided to try and grow up. I left my Blacksburg life to get a B.S. in Medical Technology at the Medical College of Virginia (MCV).
So, what did I do in 1979 with my new degree and independence? I went to work in the lab at Montgomery County Hospital. I also moved into the Main Street House run by Glen Davis. Now, I will explain how Bill (Kersch) got left holding the bag. The bag could push crawlways. After all, I pushed a crawlway into a beautiful virgin passage in Spring Hollow. Bill and I were married on May 28, 1982.
We moved to Texas, where Bill began his over 30 year career as a Petroleum Geologist for Conlips. While living out West, I had a few cats, dogs, horses, and Kathryn. Bill caved and worked. I did as little as possible.
In 2013, My family of 3 plus retired to Blacksburg so we could be near caves and cavers. Bill has loved caving, especially in the Mammoth Cave System. He has also partied like he never was able to when he was a student at Virginia Tech (VPI&SU). I have been to Jones Cave in West Virginia and New River, among others, since we have been back. I want to cave more with Bill when he slows down.
Over the years, I have had fun at OTRs, NSS Conventions, and VPI events. I got together with many cavers. As Wil Orndoff says, “Why not me?”. I want to thank my caver family for allowing me to be me. Special gratitude goes to Doug Perkins for being Vice President when I was a Trainee. Now back to Bill Douty who said, “I would rather drink with my caving buddies, than cave with my drinking buddies”. Trainees, get your membership and be a VPI Caver for life.
