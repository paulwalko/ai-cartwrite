How NOT to Cave.
By Matthew Kok
You've all read countless articles on proper caving technique. This is not one of those articles.
Break formations in your way. They're probably in your way, plus they'll grow back.
Take your broken formations home with you. They'll look cool on your shelf.
Use spray paint or glow sticks to mark your path. This will keep you from getting lost.
Sneak into closed caves. Closed caves = less traffic = more likely to see cool stuff.
Wake up bats. Who wants to just look at a sleeping bat?
Cave without a helmet. Helmets are hot and heavy, increasing fatigue.
Carry minimal gear. One light and as few clothes as possible. Less weight = easier
caving.
Share pictures of your caving adventure online. Be sure to include a name and location
so others can also experience the wonders of the cave for themselves.
Refuse all belays. Belay rhymes with delay. Coincidence? Delays mean you see less of
the cave.
Refuse assistance from others. It makes you look weak. Nobody wants to be the
weakest link in the chain.
Leave your trash. Somebody else will pick it up.
Rappel as fast as possible. Don't want to hold up the group.
Don't bother checking your harness. It wastes time and you probably put it on right
anyway
Don't lock your 'biners. Again, this wastes time.
Don't tie a knot at the end of your rope. This wastes rope.
Tie the rope straight into bolt hangers. This way you don't need to carry extra carabiners.
Take a salamander or two home with you. They're cool pets.
Free dive those sumps. Organizing a dive trip takes too long. Better to just check it out
now.
Pass gas in tight passages. It's unhealthy to hold it in.
Don't pad lips. They don't call it Indestructible Rope Technique for nothing.
Don't question other people's rigging. It's offensive. They will see this as you not trusting
them or thinking they're not good enough.
Don't ask how others are doing or check up on them. It's none of your business.
If somebody is uncomfortable doing something, make them do it anyway. Otherwise
they'll never conquer their fear.
Don't call landowners or knock on their door to ask about their cave. You don't want to
wake them up from a nap.
Sneak away from the group. Don't be a sheep.
Run whenever you can. It's faster than walking.
Jump down everything you can. It's easier and faster than getting on rope.
Don't write TROG articles. You should probably be studying instead.
Share this article with others. It's full of good tips.
