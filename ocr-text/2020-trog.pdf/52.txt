9. Always come to a rescue prepared Dwayne did bring backup when he got back with his Jeep. But no medical supplies. And Matt Vest showed up in nothing but flip flops, a bathrobe, and a cowboy hat. Allegedly, they debated bringing actual medical splints before deciding against it; I had to improvise instead.
10. "So, uh, a hiking accident? Hiking accident" Dwayne's proposed cover story, for some reason. Lewisgale were very very confused by my improvised splint, and wheelchairs really suck when you have a broken leg.
11. Beer's a hell of a drug. Electrolytes and morphine are better The ER nurse was just thrilled to pump opiates into me. IV, anti-nausea, opiates. Of course, I wasn't in much pain; I just wanted some water. 6 hours after getting checked in, I'm finally put on a saline drip. Pros.
12. Cavers are good in a tight spot Obviously, Dwayne and Matt were critical to the self-rescue. But I hadn't seen the last of the cavers for the day: I got out of surgery that evening to find Joker, Ellen, Delafield, and my housemate Paul nervously awaiting my recovery. They told me how damn near everyone wanted to come visit or offered to help.
My profuse thanks goes out to all the folks who visited me in the hospital and at home, and brought me food and conversation, and to those who bussed me to doctor's appointments and the Pub. A special thanks to Paul, for keeping me from dying for those first 2 weeks, Benchoff, for dropping by at midday just to chat, and Joker, for coordinating all of the responses..
