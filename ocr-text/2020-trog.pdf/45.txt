West Virginia, Canterbury Cave, Friday, 25 January 1974: At about 2:00pm, Pete Williams
(25), Albert Ogden (23), and Scott Roths, all of the Mountain State Grotto, entered Canterburg
Cave to make observations for Ogden's Ph.D. thesis. About 200 feet inside the cave is a 34-foot
pit which Williams rigged with 70-foot length of soft-lay rope similar to Goldline. The rope
belonged to Ogden but had recently been returned to him by a fellow caver. Before beginning
the rappel, Ogden stated, Gee, this is so short, if I fell the worst that would happen is I'd break
both ankles. As Ogden began to rappel, the rope broke, dropping him 28 feet to a flat, gravel
floor. Ogden yelled as he fell and may have struck a small ledge in the descent.
In the fall Ogden lost his lamp but the Fibre-Metal helmet with a chin strap stayed in
place. Although in pain, he remained conscious and was able to report his condition to his
companions. He had a broken right leg and a back injury but was not bleeding externally.
Since the only available rope was at the bottom of the pit, Williams left to seek aid while
Roth remained at the top of the pit to keep Ogden company. William was able to notify the local
doctor and rescue group and several cavers representing the VPI, Greenbrier, and Pittsburgh
Grottos. By 4:00pm Williams returned to the cave with rescue gear he had gathered. Williams
and a medic from the local rescue group rappelled into the pit. Ogden was placed on a
backboard and wrapped in blankets.
Doctors Gewirtz arrived at the cave but was very claustrophobic. A rather small girl let
him know that he was not going to leave until he had examined Ogden. The doctor descended
by cable ladder and confirmed that the victim had a broken leg but not a back injury severe
enough to hinder the rescue effort. With the use of the backboard Ogden was raised from the
pit, but was later placed in a Stokes litter for the last 120 feet.
Analysis: The rope broke near the top. Later inspection showed green spots on the rope at the
break. The West Virginia University Chemistry Department analyzed them as being due to dilute
hydrochloric acid. Ogden, a geologist, commonly carries a container of hydrochloric acid in his
geological sampling kit.
