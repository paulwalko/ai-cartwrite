ill placed rock was causing some shoulder dystocia and had to be modified. Without the more
traditional means, a come-along was attached to this rocky impediment and it was quickly
relieved of its imprisonment in the passage. All cavers made haste into the passage. There
were tall ceilings, pretties, bats, and ongoing passage to be surveyed. Due to the new pandemic
that was just reaching the U.S, this cave was named COVID Cave. When the pandemic passes
and caving resumes we will determine what secrets this little hole in the ground holds, perhaps
on another Monday.
