Also Sarah should have communicated with everyone and said she left the rope bag, yet
she chose to wait until they needed it. Not safe, and at that point everyone is screwed.
At 39:48 during the crossing Beth has a literal drill on her harness. I have no idea why
they would need this drill but at this point whatever.
The 'biner used is not a lock off. Not safe. I also know nothing about this clipping thing
so I'm just going to ignore it.
Juno took the safety rope off to “conserve rope”. All this could have been avoided if Juno
wasn't such a show off.
Sam's gloves were not rope appropriate; why didn't she put on the gloves she used to
descend if she knew she was going to handle rope?
Juno mentions that the batteries on their lights will run out. Good on her for conserving
light but shouldn't they have brought at least one extra light? Not safe at all.
As they venture farther into the cave it becomes apparent that they aren't marking their
path, which they really should be doing if they are trying to get out.
Holly dives head first into a small passage for no reason and then starts running. This
isn't safe, but maybe it would be safer if Holly died at this point.
Holly falls down a hole. This could 100% have been prevented if she was walking
instead of running.
Everyone starts taking off their helmets all of a sudden. Not safe.
Juno decides to free climb up an unknown wall. There is a waterfall spraying water
everywhere, making it extra dangerous.
Sarah starts screaming in the cave. This is not good for cave conservation as it could
wake hibernating bats.
Beth just saw Juno go crazy and kill 3 CHUDs and then silently walks up behind her. Not
safe.

Juno stabs Beth in the neck with an ice pick. Also not safe, and honestly pretty shitty.
Juno leaves her dying friend to die alone in a cave. Shitty.
Instead of bringing an extra light Sam brought a giant green glow-stick. Not practical or
very alpine.
Sarah searches the dead bodies for any supplies or lights. This 100% is a great practice
because dead people don't need their light and you should do this if you are ever in a
freak cave accident surrounded by CHUDs.
At this point everyone has decided not to call back to Juno. Some might consider letting
your friend die alone shitty, but Juno is the one who got everyone into this mess, so it
really is the most practical and safest option.
