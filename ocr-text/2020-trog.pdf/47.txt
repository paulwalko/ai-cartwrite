The Descent: An examination of the portrayal of
caving practices and errors in the film media The
Descent
By Ellie Burnett
The Descent, a somewhat classic movie that is beloved by people everywhere and despised in
the caving community as stupid and inadequate when it comes how caving is portrayed. But
exactly what did this film show that pisses so many cavers off? This article will examine the
actions of the six cavers in the descent, praising the accurate moments and correcting the
sketch moments.
Before I start, keep in mind that although I am by no means an expert caver | am
basically an expert on The Descent. The first time I watched it was in 2012 when I was at a
middle school camp. I remember thinking how cool it was to go into this giant pit and explore a
place no one had ever gone. Between then and now I've seen the movie about 7 or 8 times;
drunk, high, sober, alone, with friends, with caving friends, in a cave, and not in a cave. Also,
this article is about the first release that was in the UK, and the sequel will not be included
because it's complete shit. Each action that the characters do will be classified as the following:
Safe: Yes you should do this while caving
Safe BUT: The action is safe but there are things you could do better
Sketch: The practice is something you probably should not do, but is most likely not life
threatening.
Not safe: Please do not do this while caving because it is not accurate and will mostly
result in an injury or death to yourself or others on your trip.
WTF: Honestly has anyone making this movie ever seen a cave because what the fuck.
Shitty: Not really caving related but just shitty stuff
Disclaimer: This movie is a British film that was shot in England and Scotland. Considering half
the directors and actors are American anyway and I know nothing about caving in the UK and
the characters are caving in an American national park in America I am going to judge off of US
caving techniques.
At the beginning of the movie Sarah's entire family is killed in a car crash. Juno goes to
the hospital but walks away instead of comforting her. Instead, Juno could have helped
her friend by being there for her instead of waiting a whole year to take her on this crazy
dangerous trip. This is shitty.
Going for a long run before a long cave trip: Safe BUT caving is very exhausting and
requires a lot of energy. Maybe save the run until later so you have all your energy for
caving.
