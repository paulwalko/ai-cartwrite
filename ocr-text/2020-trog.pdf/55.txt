The Art of Climbing
By Robert Smith
Ever since I was little, I enjoyed climbing. It started off as a necessity because I couldn't
reach light switches, so I would climb the door frame to turn it on or off. After that it was trees.
Trees provided a new frontier to climb and explore. The views from the top are breathtaking and
are worth the journey to the top. In my experience it is easier to go up than down no matter what
you are climbing.
I've always enjoyed climbing because it makes me feel like I'm on the top of the world.
Since joining the cave club, caves have provided a new challenge and area to test out my
climbing skills. Links is a cave that is mainly canyoning and I like that because it is more of a
challenge than just walking. There is an area after the filter which has the highway and the low
way. I enjoy the highway because it is easier than the low way and there is a small passage to
squeeze through at the end. Links will be a special cave because it was on my first trip to Links
and third overall trip which I got elementary climbing requirement signed off. I also did the 5-9
step over as the challenge climb. From then on, I have always been looking for challenge climbs
in other caves.
For someone who likes climbing, there are some that make me rethink what I am doing
with my life. One of them that made me slow down and strategize my moves was in Starnes.
This was not in angry Starnes, but in happy Starnes. It was at the waterfall where you look up
and see it coming down. I decided to climb up the wall to the right of the waterfall because there
was a cool ledge I wanted to be on top of. The first half of the climb was easy because it was
just climbing up to a ledge I could stand on. The other half had hand/foot holds in the wall
surface that looked like they were carved out of mud. Some of the holds were not as deep as |
would have liked, but I managed to get to the top. After getting to the top I felt a sense of
accomplishment and dread because I knew I had to eventually go down. I knew climbing down |
had to be cautious and move slow. Since the handholds were not ideal and it was a 20-foot
drop; it would have been embarrassing if I fell or slipped in front of a bunch of trainees, scarring
them for life. Thankfully, most of the trainees left when I started the descent so they wouldn't
see me mess up if I did. I made it to the halfway ledge slowly but surely. After making it to the
halfway point I knew I had made it down because I had completed the difficult part. The hard
part of down climbing is that you can't see where to put your feet. Also, the waterfall didn't help
because it was noisy and that made it hard to hear any instructions given to me on the down
climb. It is good to challenge yourself on climbs and sometimes they serve as a reality and ego
check to make sure I don't get too cocky.
Climbing is an essential skill used in caving. It helps cavers reach new areas to explore
virgin passage or to get to their favorite areas while leading a trip. On your next cave trip, I
challenge you, the reader, to climb something new or out of your comfort zone. But the most
important thing to do while climbing is that you must challenge the rock and go where no man
has gone before.
