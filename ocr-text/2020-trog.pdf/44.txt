several breaths glancing around the pocket to determine this and then dove to return to the
group. At this moment he blacked out as the pocket apparently contained very little oxygen and
high concentration of methane. The belayer saw the rapid dropping of the caver's flashlight and
quickly pulled him in with the assistance of the group. Upon being pulled from the water, the
caver showed no signs of breathing so his throat was cleared of water and mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation began immediately. The caver slowly regained normal breathing and the group
was able to exit the cave.” (Inside Earth)
Analysis: Even with a safety line, diving with only a face mask and a flashlight is reckless
Driving in cavers has always been extremely hazardous.

Florida, Little River Springs, Sunday, 27 August 1972: Three New Jersey divers, Kenneth
R. DeGrazia (23), Micheal R. Williams (24), and Robert Lewis Grauer (18) scuba dived into Little
River Springs sometime Sunday. All three drowned. Graur's body was accidentally discovered
at a depth of 60 feet and about 15 feet from the mouth of the cave. He had a knife wound an
inch wide and 2 inches deep in the stomach. The other two victims were about 10 feet apart but
45 feet deeper into the cave.
Analysis: Williams was a diving instructor and was the most experienced of the trio; Grauer the
least. All three were experienced in open water diving, but it is believed that they had little or no
cave diving experience. The National Association of Cave Diving had placed a sign near the
spring warning of its dangers for novice divers. The New Jersey group ignored the advice. They
did not use safety lines, wore only single tanks, and used inadequate, commercial lights.
Several possible explanations for Grauer's knife wound were given. His mother stated it
was just a scratch and probably happened at the funeral home. The Suwanee County Sheriff
through there had been a struggle for survival after one person ran out of air and tried to take
the air from one of his companions. The deputy sheriff thought Grauer, being the least
experienced, had panicked and the other diver had tried to prod him along with the knife. A
scuba shop owner speculated that Grauer tried to escape from the diver with the knife. Any one
of these explanations could have happened; no one will ever know what really happened to the
divers. It is clear that all three underestimated that hazards of cave driving. These were the
14th, 15th, and 16th drowning in this cave since 1960.
