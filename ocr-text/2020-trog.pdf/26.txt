Why do I cave? By Monty Noblezada
I probably ask myself this question every time I get stuck in some uncomfortably painful squeeze or finally get over an absurd lip on a vertical climb. I think it’s healthy to probably remember why one would voluntarily put themselves through pain, even if it’s fun pain. I knew after going caving for the first time at Links that I was hooked and have felt extremely motivated to go all the time. The feeling of visiting and exploring a new cave for the first time is addicting. I mean, who wouldn’t want to spend 6 hours in a dark, wet hole in the ground covered head-to-toe in glorious cave mud. Caving brings out my inner adrenaline junkie, but I don’t go for just fun thrills and danger. Exploring caves satisfies a strong, innate desire to discover and see new things. I will never forget viewing the beautiful gypsum flowers in Clover Hollow or rappelling into Valhalla. It’s mind boggling to me on just how many caves exist. There’s no shortage of caves and pits to visit and I plan on continuing to cave wherever I live. One day, I will explore all kinds of caves around the world from Siberian ice caves to Saharan desert caves and tropical pacific island caves. If I am lucky, I might live long enough to be able to explore lava tube caves on the moon or mars when interplanetary space travel becomes affordable. Although I will always remember how fortunate we are to have so many fantastic caves near Virginia Tech. No two caves are really the same and I appreciate that fact immensely. I also like that caving can be easy or deeply challenging depending on the cave and one’s skill level. I enjoy the highly physical and technical challenge, but sometimes I also like to take things slow and make time to marvel at cave formations. While I prefer long horizontal trips, I have grown to really enjoy all the complexities and nuances of vertical caving and pit bouncing. I am still learning new knots, rigging, and how to improve my frogging technique. Lastly, caving forces you to rely and trust others, even with your life at times. It’s a dangerous sport and I am fortunate to be a part of this club where I can learn safe practices from some of the best cavers out there. We have amazing people and I am happy to have caved with them during my time at Virginia Tech. So far I have racked up over 150 hours of being underground and I am content knowing I don’t regret a second of it. When I ask myself why I cave, I simply say it’s a part of who I am.
