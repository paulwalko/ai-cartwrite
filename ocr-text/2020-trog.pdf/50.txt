After finding Beth still alive Sarah finds out Juno had an affair with her husband. Very
shitty Juno, very shitty.
Sarah breaks Juno's leg and leaves her to die. Normally this would be shitty behavior but
is it really with Juno being the worst person ever?
Overall I found this film very inaccurate and the choices made were stupid and sketch,
mostly because of Juno. Remember kids, CHUD attacks are not preventable but caving
accidents are!
