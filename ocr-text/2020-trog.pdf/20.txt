Things I've Learned in TAG
By Matthew Kok
At the time you are reading this (probably at, or just after Picnic), I will have spent
almost two years caving in TAG (Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia). During that time, I
have learned many things, and this is a short list naming and describing some of those
learned things. Trainees', this article is mostly directed at you. If you ever have an
opportunity to visit TAG to go caving, I (and pretty much everyone else) highly
recommend you take it.
There is no such thing a dry cave
I don't mean that there are no dry caves, you just probably won't visit one
because they're boring relative to all the other caves which will probably get you wet.
The good news here is that TAG caves tend to be a few degrees warmer than
Virginia/West Virginia caves. This means that hypothermia, while still a threat, is not as
much of a concern, especially during Summer. Water can be fun, but project caving
while you're soaking wet still kind of sucks (at which time you should recall and adhere to
Rule #5)". Wetsuits are still recommended for full-body submersion.
VPI is very different from other grottos
l've spent time caving with Dogwood City Grotto and Birmingham Grotto. You
can go caving as a brand-new person in TAG, but don't expect to get on weekly trips like
you would at Virginia Tech. DCG and BHG rarely do public trips, so going caving usually
means paying for a yearly membership to get on the member-only trips. Just like VPI,
existing members of these grottos volunteer to lead trips. Unlike VPL however, TAG
caves worth seeing are usually require a long drive and the members are usually adults
with jobs, families, and other things more important than caving to attend to".
The ease at which you can start caving with VPI is something that you take for
granted until you see how other grottos operate. VPI has caving trips weekly, loaner
helmets and lights, regular vertical training sessions, loaner vertical gear and members
who secretly wish they could teach a class called “Caving 1015: An Introduction to
Caving”. Going caving as often as you can and the ease at which you can learn new
things is something unique to VPI, appreciate it.
Carbide is still a thing
People still use it.
I assume for novelty.
1Sorry, I meant Prospective Members.
2 If you are unfamiliar with Rule #5, please contact your nearest VPI Cave Club member.
3 Yep, some people believe there are more important things than caving.
