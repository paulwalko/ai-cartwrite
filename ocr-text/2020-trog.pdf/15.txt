equipment you need differs little from back in Virginia, but you may want to ditch the extra
polypro and pick up a pair of elbow pads. Keep your trash bag/heat tent in case of emergency
though, if you get wet and super-lost 70ish degree rock will leach out your heat eventually.
The bulk of my experience and thoughts caving here have been focused either on the
delightful social interactions you get on a caving trip, or on the physical realities of moving
through passage. Dealing with hazards is an important part of caving, but a proportionally small
part of the experience compared to the previous two. I hope you'll forgive me then if I spend the
rest of my article discussing them; I think they're very interesting to write about.
When you move from Virginia to Texas, you trade one set of hazards for another. First
the good side of the trade; hypothermia after wading through a waist high stream is no longer a
pressing worry, as the caves here are warm (around 70 F) and for the most part dry. Falling a
significant height is rarely a worry either, as while Austin does have a few notable pits, exposure
isn't frequently a part of caving the same way it is in SWVA. As far as approach & entrance
hazards, you needn't worry that freeze-thaw cycles have loosened rocks above entrances on
warm spring days; it hardly ever freezes here. Lyme's disease isn't as prevalent here as in the
east, instead there's a relapsing fever that can (usually) be quickly treated by antibiotics and
lacks the long-term effects of Lyme's.
Now the negative: Bad air does exist, although it's usually just a problem in the
summertime. Standard practice here is to carry a BIC lighter to test the air as you go, as
changes in the flame's behavior will alert you when the partial pressure of oxygen in the air
starts to decrease. A few cavers also carry CO2 meters, but these are expensive and not
rugged. I have heard some cavers insist that the oxygen content of bad air always varies
inversely with the CO2 content, and thus the lighter is sufficient for testing, while others (notably
including someone who carries a CO2 meter) say there is a second, secret flavor of bad air
where the CO2 content of the air increases without an equal decrease in oxygen. Short of
caving with someone who carries a CO2 meter, all you can do about this sort of air is ask
around before you go and pay close attention to the way you feel as you cave, especially in the
summer. The situation where you must test most carefully and pay the closest attention is when
rappelling into pits within caves, where CO2 can stratify if there's not much airflow.
Texas also has plenty of snakes. Rattlesnakes and copperheads love to hang out in
cave entrances (I've seen one of each in caves so far!), which provide both an easy place to
feed as mice enter and leave the cave in the morning and evening, and a cool place to be
during the heat of Texan summer. Because of this, you enter and exit caves slowly and carefully
here, maybe even tossing some sticks in before yourself to drive the snakes back into their
cracks and out of the path of travel. Listen carefully for rattles, and don't take it personally if you
need to turn your trip around before it starts because the rattlesnake wedged itself under a rock
you need to crawl past. Keep in mind though that the snakes don't want to bite you, and if you
don't mess with them they generally won't mess with you.
