closure in this loop. We located four major blunders in the inclination readings of the N-survey; this loop now closes nearly dead-on.
We put in the N-Survey in 1999 (20 years ago! Wow! Really?) and on that trip Jim Currens had explored a short breakdown gallery north from N11 to a hole where you could see into a 20x20 ft room. He described the lead as a “Prybar Dig”’. I had always assumed that this just overlooked the J42 dome and so gave it a low priority.
I had given Mandy and Matt the heavy, steel digging implements (“I can’t take them because I am carrying the DistoX”) so I figured we had better put them to use or I would never hear the end of it. Time to dig!
Mandy pulled out the crowbar and Matt and I scrambled up to the breakdown hole to begin work. The lead was just as Jim described; three shingled rocks blocked a short crawl into some sort of large space. I accessed the physics of the blocks and determined that it was safe to remove them without bringing down the ceiling (a single massive slab). A few minutes with the bar and they were all loose but entangled with each other. After watching my futile attempts to remove even the smallest pieces, Matt says, “Want me to give you a hand with that?” Matt just grabs the biggest block (1x1x1) and rocks it right out of the hole, followed by the two smaller ones. A good hand to have on a dig!
We were now looking into a tight but passable squeeze. I wriggle on through tossing small rocks ahead so that I would hear any cliff before I crawled off it. Shouts reveal an echo, but the rocks make no booms. I emerged at the top of a breakdown slope leading down into a 15hx10w canyon with flow scallops on the walls. I look up and there is a 15 ft diameter well rising through the bedrock overhead and, above that, an expanse of flat ceiling. My heart starts to pound, ‘Holy shit! That ain’t the ceiling of no dome! There is a huge passage up there!’ I start excitedly chanting, “Virgin Cave! Virgin Cave!” Matt, who has never been caving before, is wondering, “Should I be getting excited about this?” HELL, YES! You should be excited – this happens like once every fifty leads and ten years! It looks really big ahead and I restrain my urge to run down the slope, saying, “I am not going to scoop this, we need to go back and start the survey, but I think you are going to like it!”
We continue the N-survey from N15, and by N18 we are through the squeeze and at the top of the slope. We set N19 at a major intersection at the base of the slope and turn right into a dome which I expected to be the dome at J42 at the head of Goes Canyon – it was not. This dome is 25 feet high and 20 feet across. There are several slot canyons at the top, but they do not appear to be passable. The dome has a passable active drain that heads southwest for at least 35 feet, and above that a possible abandoned drain that is obscured by breakdown. These leads are heading towards the J42 Dome which is literally 35 ft away – they must connect. Matt locates an 8Hx5W canyon off the side of the dome that heads northeast, paleo-upstream, with air. We place our last station, N23, into this. Matt reports that it goes at least 100 feet and shows no sign of ending.
Back at N19 there is a steep breakdown ramp that heads northwest up into a large upper-level passage with an expansive flat ceiling 28 feet above N19. Mandy balks at climbing the slope due to all the precarious virgin breakdown. I send Matt back up towards N18 where I had earlier spotted a hole up though breakdown into black space. Sure enough, Matt can climb
