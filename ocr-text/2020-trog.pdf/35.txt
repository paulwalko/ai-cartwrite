Karst along the New River Trail
By Eli Meyer
The entrance to the ungated cave, up a steep embankment and noticeable
from the trail.
The New River Trail, a Virginia state park, stretches a 58 mile route, between the towns
of Pulaski and Galax, paralleling the New River for most of it. The crushed gravel roadbed,
gentle grade, and slowly sweeping curves of this former railroad right-of-way makes for an easy
ride. The observant cyclist or hiker will notice many interesting cracks, crevasses, and fissures
in the limestone cliffs which tower in places up to a hundred feet over the trail. Between Foster
Falls and the Route 622 bridge there is a cave entrance immediately adjacent to the trail. It is
gated, locked, and maintained by the State Park service. A few miles southwards, about 2.5
miles downriver from Foster Falls, is the above pictured cave. Overlooked by most casual
passersby, access is gained from a short, easy scramble over boulders and moss covered logs.
Some patches of flowstone adorn the walls near the entrance, and a natural skylight to the left
allows light farther into the tunnel. The skeletal remains of a deer were found just inside the
entrance.
The cave is not particularly spectacular, nor large. It consists entirely of a short section of
walking passage, ending in a breakdown choke after only 100 feet or so. A possible lead
through a very tight crawlway was noted near the top of the breakdown, on the left-hand side.
However, no air movement was observed.
The trail passes adjacent to many exposed limestone cliffs, most natural, some made by
blasting for the construction of the railroad. There is doubtless fruitful potential for further
exploration of karst features present along the right-of-way.
