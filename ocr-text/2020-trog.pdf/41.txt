So, after much experimentation, I found that I prefer this two knot texas kick system with
helicals for ascending rope, primarily because my backup attachment point is connected to my
harness and the knots are both above my waist and are easy to slide after being loaded. In the
future, I will continue to test it on other single rope techniques like passing knots. Perhaps there
are some advantages to the standard three knot system that I have not discovered yet. In any
case, it is fun to learn and test new techniques to figure out my preferences and discover the
strengths and weaknesses of different approaches.
