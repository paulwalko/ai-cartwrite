Mortuary Caves in the Southeastern United States By Emilie Hollingsworth
With an air of darkness and quiet akin to that of the womb, it is no surprise that early human populations tied great religious significance to caves, and associated them with the process of death and dying. The indigenous populations of the eastern United States made similar connections. Ritual use of caves in our area (VA, KY, TAG) dates back to the Woodland Era (approx. 1000 BCE to Colombian Contact).
Virginia itself is home to 50 known mortuary caves as of the early 2000’s. The closest example is Bone Cave, located in Lee County. Remains found just outside and fully within Bone Cave include those of one newborn, a child, an adolescent, and two adults, as well as those of several varieties of animals. Pottery, beads, and plant material dating back to the Woodland Era were also discovered.
A larger-scale example of the religious importance of caves includes the Salts/Mammoth Cave System in Kentucky. 43 individuals of various ages and sexes were found in the Salts system, along with a very wide variety of plant and animal specimens from the same era. Marks on the human bones suggest ritual defleshing, scalping, and burning. Children and infants were mostly spared from this treatment. Given the location of certain specimens in the vestibule of the cave, it is thought that the entrance was used as a sort of staging area for ritual activities that took place further in the cave. Larger water features, such as the streams and waterfalls present in this particular system, would have likely attracted a large amount of ritual activity. In addition, human mummies found in the cave were possibly consulted as oracles, as was common in Mesoamerica around the same time. Fecal matter in the cave indicates a ritual diet of unusual foods, as well as the fact that this particular population were not skilled hunters, but possibly relied on a more humanoid source of protein.
This intense history of subterranean ritual and sacrifice is a testament to the long-standing religious value of caves, and a sign that our tradition of sacrificing inadequate trainees to the CHUDs is a valuable one.
