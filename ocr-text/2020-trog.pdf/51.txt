Lessons Learnt Partying with Dwayne
A special report prepared by Eric C. Landgraf for the 2020 publication of American Drinking Accidents.
For those missing the context: on New Years' Eve, rather than making it out to the Bat Ranch or the Ficcos', I accepted Dwayne's invitation to the party he and Matt Vest were hosting. I broke my leg later that evening. This is a particularly biased (and truncated) version of that story.
1. Car club kids have fragile masculinity Dwayne and Matt Vest have a hot tub. I was the only caver guest at what was basically a car-club party. Hilarity ensued.
2. "This is the kind of thing that, when you look back, will make it a great story" What Dwayne said, when we got off the 100-foot zipline off the porch, and I asked if we should take our harnesses off before getting food.
3. "Someone will twist an ankle there" Dwayne's observation on the step up at the top of the drainage ditch (yes, this is foreshadowing).
4. Bojangles closes at 22:00... We knew before leaving the house, but it wasn't less disappointing.
5. ...But gas station taquitos are very good Especially when you're eating while walking, and have been drinking for 8 hours.
6. The moon is bright; still have lights Dwayne and I did this whole journey with 1 light. Which wasn't too bad going up, but it was definitely one reason for my fall. It likely wouldn't have been a problem if we both had lights.
7. Adrenaline sobers you up quickly Dwayne and I didn't do anything particularly stupid once I had broken my leg. Dwayne got assistance for rescue, and I made sure someone besides Dwayne knew. But we weren't sober enough to call the rescue squad: it didn't seem that bad. At least I hadn't dropped my taquitos and gatorade.
8. "Pics or it didn't happen" Basically what everyone said after hearing about my broken leg. There are no pics. But I do have some pretty nice scars, instead. Once this coronavirus thing dies down, I may even make it to the hospital to get copies of X-Rays.
