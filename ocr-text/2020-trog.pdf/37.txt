Seven lessons you might learn from a New Mexico
lava tube
By Penelope Vorster
1. To appreciate shitty boots: Before you reach the entrance, your trusty boots will be so
shredded from the approach that you will wonder how and why Ancestral Puebloans
shod in yucca sandals traveled this hellish landscape. beyond the entrance, abandon all
hope for your footwear. by your fourth day on the lava, your toes will look out in horror
from their newly ripped windows at the floor of the crawl, which is cooled from God's
searing hatred for us all. wear boots you're fine with putting in the trash soon.
2. New kinds of pain: The scrape of a chert nodule is a butterfly kiss compared to the
wrath of a basaltic coralloid.
3. North is a lie: The walls are magnets. The floor, ceiling, and every piece of breakdown
you encounter makes a direct attempt to sabotage your survey. You may feel dread as
each backsight betrays you more than the last, this is normal. Your face may be
permanently changed from furrowing your brow at your book, trying to reconcile lines
with sketch. Thankfully, maps of lava tubes are rarely used for navigation other than to
find archeological sites.
4. Spatial mistrust: each rock, regardless of size, will move. Expect it, lurch with every
step you take, learn the dance of the west. Don't touch the ceiling.
5. Humility: Your squeezebox number means nothing. See 2, 4.
6. Improvisation: Cartographic symbology for lava tubes is as nebulous and arcane as
New Mexican cartography standards are tortuous. Does anyone know them? Will you tell
me? Make something up, it won't matter.
7. Discernment: Sometimes it is worth it to do unpleasant things in the pursuit of data, of
booty, of glory. Usually it's better in limestone. You like limestone.
