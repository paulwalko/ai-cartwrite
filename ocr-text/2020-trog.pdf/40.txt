The primary disadvantage of the texas system is that it can be less efficient than the frog
system because you have to slide your bottom ascender after loading your top knot. Ideally, in
the frog system, your chest ascender moves up with you as you stand. However, sometimes it
doesn't due to lack of rope weight or because you are doing a more difficult maneuver like going
over a lip. In any case, you can not mirror a frog system using knots so this disadvantage does
not apply when you are only comparing knot ascension systems.
However, there are a few disadvantages to the texas kick knot system described by Cornell
Tree Climbing:
• The use of the prusik requires loosening the bridge of the loaded knot before you can slide
it again. In the video, he prefered to do a "hand over hand” motion to advance the knot,
which is inefficient and shouldn't be necessary. Ideally, you should be able to simply slide
the knot from below without grabbing the rope above the knot, which could cause you to
accidentally apply downward pressure on the loaded knot and capsizing it.
• Their use of the prusik used carabiners to clip onto the harness, which I've found often
require careful attention to avoid cross loading them while ascending since they are being
repeatedly loaded and unloaded. However, this disadvantage can be mitigated by simply
tying a figure eight on a (large) bight on the end of the cord and using the loop to create the
prusik and the other end of the cord to tie in with a figure eight follow through. Alternatively,
using a clove hitch to attach the carabiners may also prevent cross loading, though I have
not tested this idea.
• Since the prusik is tied on a loop rather than the end of the rope, you need to untie or
unclip your harness attachment point to undo the hitch to do a changeover.
So I wanted to modify this system to use helicals and tie in knots rather than carabiners.
Doing this with the top knot cord was simple because you can tie the helical with one end and
tie in with the other, just as you would in the three knot system. However, doing this with the
lower knot cord is not as simple. Since the prusik (and any of the other aforementioned friction
hitches except the helical) is tied with a bight of rope rather than a single line, you can have two
lines coming out, one attaching to your harness as a backup and the other
extending to your foot, as shown in the video. However, this is not possible with the helical since
it is tied with a single line at the end of the rope. Thus, I had to tie an alpine butterfly loop that
extended down to my foot just below the helical. I could then use the other end of the cord to tie
in. If you want a foot loop for each foot, you can tie a bowline on a bight on the alpine butterfly
loop. Alternatively, you could tie a purcell prusik, which would allow you to adjust the length of
your foot loops. See the next figure.
