When exploring the illustrious cave systems around the state of Virginia, across the United States, and even outside of the country, it is important to recognize that not every cave will be structured exactly the same. Some may have large open boreholes that give you plenty of room to explore while others may have you stream crawling for a large portion of time and being really mad at the person leading woke you up hungover from the previous night to go this trip. In any event, having the proper gear for the type of cave you are going into can really affect whether you had a really good or horrendously bad experience. This is something I had to learn the hard way when I got invited to my first out of state cave trip to Windy Mouth at WVACS last October.
Being still semi-new to caving and only having gone to the more local caves around the Blacksburg area I did not really know what to expect from this opportunity to delve into a cave I have never been to or heard of before, but like any naïve and eager trainee I wanted to go regardless. Once we park and get ready to head on into the cave I was kind of confused at first because we were right next to a stream and that’s when Nick Socky (the trip leader and amazing caver for any new trainees who happen to read this at some point in the future) pointed downstream and said it is about a twenty min walk to the entrance. This scenario is what some individuals like to refer to as “Caver Distance”1. Now, this brings me to my first point of being properly prepared for cave trips; depending on the amount of walking you will be doing to the cave, into the cave, around the cave, back out of the cave, and finally back to your car you will probably want some sort padding in your boots or wear a couple layers of socks to reduce the amount of strain on your feet. Obviously rule #52 will automatically come into effect if it starts to become an annoyance and you complain, but if you can prepare for a lot of walking beforehand then why not?
When we finally reached the entrance, the shape of the passage looked like someone had just drilled a large hole into the side of a cliff and just made a really long mineshaft. There were some old and worn out knee pads by the entrance and that’s when Nick has described it as his “graveyard of old cave gear”. When I asked if he thought I could still get and use out of them he did not really say anything, but instead just laughed. We then proceeded to crawl for
