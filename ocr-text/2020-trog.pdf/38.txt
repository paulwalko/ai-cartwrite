A Comparison of Knot Ascension Systems
By Jeff McCullen
There are numerous ascender systems that can be constructed using knots and friction
hitches. I experimented with some of these systems at the platform and identified some of the
advantages and disadvantages of each one. In particular, I evaluated two components of knot
ascension systems: friction hitch choice and whether to use a two or three knot system. In the
end, my preference is to use helicals with a two knot system because it is easy to slide the
knots and has two connection points to my harness so I don't have to worry about getting in a
heel hang.
There are numerous friction hitches to choose from. The ones I decided to evaluate were
the helical, prusik, klemheist, and hedden (upside-down klemheist). The helical was the easiest
to slide after loading, however, it required more time to tie and practice to reduce the slack to
minimize the stretch after loading. Unlike the other friction hitches, it is tied with a single line of
rope rather than a loop, which makes it possible to untie it from the rope without first untying the
end that ties into your harness during a changeover. The prusik did not stretch as much and,
unlike the helical, tightened automatically so there was no need to worry about reducing the
slack. However, it binded easily, especially with six coils, requiring me to loosen the bridge of
the knot to begin sliding the hitch again. Unlike the other friction hitches, the prusik can be
loaded in both directions, making it suitable for traverses. The klemheist and hedden hitches
were similar to the prusik but less prone to binding after load and only able to be loaded in one
direction. However, neither of these was as easy to slide as the helical.
A knot ascension system can use two or three knots. In a three knot system, at least one
point of contact must connect to your harness and the other two can attach to your feet with
"chicken loops” so that, if your top knot capsizes, you will get caught in a “heel hang”. To ascend
the rope, you slide your top knot (which is attached to your harness) up about as high as your
head and sit down on it. With the top knot weighted, slide your bottom two knots (which are
attached to your feet) up. Finally, stand up on your bottom knots, unweighing your top knot so
you can slide it up again. In a two knot system, both points of contact must connect to your
harness. The top knot attaches to your harness in the same manner as in a three knot system.
However, your lower knot attaches to your harness as your backup in case the top knot
capsizes. A loop in the same cord extends down to your feet but there is no need for chicken
loops because you already have a backup attachment point on your harness. To ascend the
rope, you slide your top knot up, weight it, and step down on the loop extending from your
bottom knot, allowing you to slide your top knot up again. This two knot ascension system is
called the "texas kick”.
