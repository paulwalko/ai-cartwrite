Spreading histoplasmosis spores by kicking up dusty bat poop is also a worry in Texas,
particularly in dusty caves with large bat populations. However, many of the caves in Austin
specifically don't host large bat populations, and no matter where you are avoiding close contact
with bats and their waste is good practice.
While the specifics of the activities might differ a bit from place to place, it seems to me
that cavers (and their parties) are much the same wherever you go. If anyone wants to come
visit me in Texas after the pandemic winds down, I'd be happy to show you around and take you
caving. Two last things I need to mention: One thing the UT grotto (or more specifically Kara
Savvas) does exceptionally well is programming for the meetings, every single meeting has
some incredible talk with hosts ranging from expedition cavers, bat, salamander, and fish
scientists, and cave divers, to forensic anthropologists. Coronavirus has not managed to put a
stop to this, as even our Zoom meetings have presentations. The other is that Bexar grotto
down in San Antonio is another lively, active group whose cavers have left good impressions on
me. Stay safe and have fun VPI, I'll see you at Halloween!
