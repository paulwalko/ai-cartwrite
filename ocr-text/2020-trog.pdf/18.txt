Rowan climbed up last and we thought a rope pad was forever lost
A sad but acceptable cost of the trip.
But upon pulling up the rope,
We found that the rope pad had tangled its strings,
And somehow formed a knot two feet from the bottom of the rope
We thought it was lost, it said nope,
Back down the hill, we packed in the truck again
And bounced along back to our cars
Wednesday:
Lovely hike to fern cave with the manager Steve
Got some stories, spilled some tea
Found a red eft on the way up, a lovely little friend.
Split the group in two for a full send.
Four went horizontal,
My five went to surprise
Walking in the stream under the waterfall
Where the cave resides.
Crawling along an edge to an abyss
With a room of caver mud art
I nearly didn't go down because with the rope weight I couldn't get a good start.
Headlights were deceiving,
Distance wasn't real,
Reaching the bottom was relieving,
And climbing up in the darkness an incredible feeling.
Overall on the trip-we gained an appreciation for space blankets,
One walkie talkie was lost to a puddle, brave soul, for its service we thank it.
And I found an albino crayfish.
Once out of the cave and back down the mountain
We learned of the newly declared pandemic And how our fountain of learning
Had declared all classes to be online.
We were mostly fine,
Kinda in shock
Thursday:
Thursday was tumbling rock
Speed caving for fun
The short people unlocked their powers to run
Fully standing where others had to bend
Ariel was quite proud of her ability to full send
We had a dance party at one point
And a photo shoot near the Christmas tree
Truly both sights to behold, indeed.
Back out of the cave we got pizza at joes
With 8 huddled around a booth for 4 as it goes
18
