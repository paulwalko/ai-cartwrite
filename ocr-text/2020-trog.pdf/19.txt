Back at nss, cards against humanity was played
With some delayed reactions
Like “Black, COMMA, dude”
(A request for a black card)
We laughed incredibly hard.
Some sock wrestling was had
Otto was tied to a chair
It was an overall interesting day, to be fair
Friday:
Stephens gap was the last cave
And my first to rig
I did half my test
And the rest was completed
A week later.
The pit was nice, though wet
As waterfalls tend to be.
We found trout lilies and trillium on the hike,
Lovely as always to see.
It all made me think of last year when Moneyhun went down the pit on his bike.
We returned and packed to leave
Having had a damp but enjoyable week.
Saturday:
The entire ride back consisted of cave themed yo momma jokes via messenger, such as the
following:
yo mama so fat I have to get a belay to do a body traverse on her
yo momma so ugly that she's been repelling for the last 4 decades
yo momma so stupid she tried to put a fat rabbit knot on a diet
yo momma so fat she considers borehole a squeeze
yo momma so stupid, ants go spelunking in her brain
yo momma so fat you could survey her chin rolls
yo momma smells so bad we had to send Wil Orndorff in with an air measurer
yo momma so ugly she could get cast as a chud without needing any makeup
yo momma so stupid she'd try descending with a "rack" in a way that would cause some very
interesting friction burns
yo momma so stupid she keeps trying to take bites out of a bowlines
yo momma so stupid she thinks two figure eights are a figure 16
yo momma so stupid she painted her nose black to stop the spread of WNS
yo momma so ugly that the trip leader suggested doing lights out the whole cave trip
yo momma so fat that when she coiled rope we could fit it over the whole car
yo momma so fat we had to switch to 11cm rope
yo momma so fat she uses 8mm as actual shoestrings
