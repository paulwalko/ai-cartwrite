The rope was not inspected before use. Routine inspection and testing of caving ropes
is unfortunately not done as frequently as it should be.
The rescue was hampered by the lack of proper rescue equipment such as pulleys.
Since no leg splints were available, an inflatable arm splint was used on Ogden's leg. This
caused his leg fracture to become compound. Much valuable time was lost waiting for the
frightened doctor to enter the cave.
