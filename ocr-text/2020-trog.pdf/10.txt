Cave Biota Introductions and Ratings
in the style of those memes jason sargent keeps sending me
By Reilly Blackwell
1. Millipede
A millipede is quite low to the ground, but his sheer quantity of legs qualifies him as a high
performer. If he is Kind he will be easy to spot. if he is grey and purple he is rude and a Hider. If
he has many long wiggly hairs he is an Orndorff. three stars
2. Pseudoscorpion
A pseudoscorpion is your god now. someday one of us might be as cool as a pseudoscorpion.
Whether he is an Arm Day Pseudoscorpion, who can be trusted with holding your baby, or a
Hesper Kernel, who can be trusted with holding your corn, a pseudoscorpion can be trusted
further than you can throw him. Please do not throw him, he is very delicate. five stars but
these stars come with a warning: if you fuck with a pseudoscorpion he will fight you, and so will
3. Springtail
Springtails were put on this earth to punish us for our sins. I have tried thousands of times to
catch springtails and because I am sinful I have dropped thousands of springtails. If you know
any really nice virgins please send them my way, I can't catch springtails, my family is dying.
Some springtails are silver and they get an extra star for being the Joe Exotic of springtails.
flamboyant, traitorous bastards. one star; two for the Springtail King.
4. Snail
Snails might be sand. They're having an ongoing identity crisis. If you can spot em they are
great. Some look like a boob and those get four stars. Mike Futrell, greatest caver in all italia,
gives snails two point five stars for impeding the velocity of his booty scooping.
5. Cricket
Crickets are boring except for when they impersonate spiders. Make sure you bring your
Jenn-O-Meter to check if this cricket is successfully impersonating a spider. one star
6. Shrimp
We don't have cave shrimp in virginia. Get the fuck outta here. zero stars
7. Isopods
These come in two flavors: Aquatic and Ranch. Aquatic Isopods can move with no vitesse but
they do have pretty sweet antennae. four stars. Please do not eat isopods unless you have a
permit from the state.
8. Salamanders
A salamander is the supermodel of the cave. Her tail is long and has many curves. She is
sparkly, or green, or orange, depending on her wardrobe. If she is green please Report Her To
The State because she is probably a communist. If she is orange you can trust her, not with
your life, but probably the life of a trainee, four point five stars.
9. Diplurans
Diplurans dance only to Wiggle by Jason Derulo & Snoop Dogg. A dipluran has two tails, so if
you are an ass man this is the cave biota for you. I am not an ass man so diplurans get two
stars.
