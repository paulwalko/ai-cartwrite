Sometimes it smells bad. TAG cavers still like to have fun
Whatever people have been telling you about TAG, it’s probably true Longer caves, deeper pits, more organisms, more water, stickier mud, darker darkness – it’s all true. Whatever caves in Virginia do, TAG probably turns it up a notch.
Everyone knows everyone Cavers are a tight knit bunch, as you’ve probably figured out. It is not uncommon for one caver to belong to more than one grotto, or for non-members to show up at your grotto camp out or trip. In my time here, I have met an unexpected number of people who have caved with VPI before or know another VPI member. Ever heard of the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon? Well in TAG there is about one degree between you and just about any other caver; if you don’t know John Doe personally, you definitely know someone who does. Caver Measurements
4 VPI cavers do not seem to use Caver Distance. I suspect this is because a large number of VPI members are engineers whose degrees and careers depend heavily on their ability to accurately measure things.
In TAG, age truly is just a number. TAG cavers are just like VPI cavers, except with more money and less hair. Mudslides, swimming, and playing in the mud are a few of a TAG caver’s favorite things to do underground. When not in a cave, you can find a TAG caver participating in activities such as: partying, planning a party, and cleaning up after a party. The average age of a VPI caver tends to be lower than non-college affiliated grottos, yet for some reason, the amount of partying, shenanigans, and general hooliganism remains consistent across all age groups of cavers.
You’ve probably learned from fellow VPI cavers about “Caver Time”. You probably learned about Caver Time the morning of your first cave trip because the leading member was horribly late. There is not exact definition or formula for Caver Time, but a safe formula to follow when planning caving trips is: t caver = t actual + 1 5
What you might not have heard of from Virginia cavers is “Caver Distance”. This is something only recently I learned about in TAG. Caver Distance refers to, as you are probably figuring out, the inaccurate estimate of distance by a caver. 4 When a caver tells you that a cave is only a short walk from the parking area or campsite, they really mean the cave is a mile up the mountain. If someone says they can see the cave entrance from here, they can see a mountain and know the cave entrance is on the other side. Basically, if a caver is telling you about a cave to you using ambiguous words to describe distance, they are either exaggerating or understating the true distance.
