winter the water temperature is very low; the outside temperature was 6 degrees below
freezing. The pair wore slacks and long-sleeved shirts with Air Force exposure suits over them.
Over these suits they had an additional pair of slacks and a jacket. They wore hard hats and
had adequate primary and back-up lighting. Mr. McKeever, the cave's owner, had advised them
not to go due to high water and cold, but did not forbid them entry.
At the Dardanelles (some 3300 feet in), a low stream crawl about 500 feet long, Bucca's
exposure suit began to take water, either due to looseness or rips. The pair proceeded to the
Mountain Room and about 1000 feet beyond, when Bucca began to feel the effects of the cold
water; numb hands and feet. They commenced to leave. At the Dardanelles, Lock also got wet
for the same reasons as Bucca. As their progress toward the entrance continued, the cold took
a firmer grip upon Bucca.
In Lydia's Lake he stumbled and fell many times. Lock gave continual encouragement to
Bucca, who was now “completely numb and stiff;" he crawled the last 1000 feet to the entrance
with much difficulty. This was at 11-12 p.m. Lock partly carried and dragged Bucca to a shed
where he changed their clothes and cooked some soup. Bucca, however, remained
unconscious. Lock then sought out the assistance of Mr. McKeever and together they carried
Bucca to the house.
Lock and Mckeever received Bucca, but in a state of delirium he burned himself upon
the hot stove. Finally, about two hours after entering the house, he recovered sufficiently to talk
about the incident.

Analysis: Bucca could not have been more than minutes away from death by hypothermia
(Bucca) “Overholt is an exhausting cave under ideal conditions. The combination of
extremely cold weather and the failure of the suits to keep dry defeated us more than anything
else. I suggest a tougher suit with a different neck enclosure would make the difference
between comfortable caving and needless exposure in a cave such as this.”

Mexico, Sótano de la Tinaja, 1 July 1972: A group of cavers entered Sótano de la Tinaja for
the purpose of pushing a siphon in an attempt to connect the cave with Sótano del Arroyo. It
was thought that the siphon might actually be only a sump with air space just on the other side
of the duck under. It was hoped that a swimmer could determine this within 20 feet, and if he
could not, he was to return without going farther. Don Broussard was going to try the
connection. He was wearing a diving mask and had a flashlight tied to his waist/ John Fish was
to belay Broussard with a safety line tied to the diver's waist.
“A system of tugging signals was arranged and the caver entered the siphon. After
swimming about 17 feet he surfaced in what turned out to be only a small air space . He took
