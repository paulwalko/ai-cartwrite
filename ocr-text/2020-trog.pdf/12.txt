Monday club
-Vanessa Pinter
Monday club was formed out of necessity and boredom. Two friends with an unusual day off and no one else around found each other and united. On the inaugural Monday, Joker and I decided to take my 4Runner out to a local four-wheeling track. All was going well. We descended steep embankments, traversed rushing creeks, and escaped bottomless mud pits with only the loss of one running board. We decided we needed more. I took a short horseshoe shaped track straight up the mountain, and on the descent, the trees seemed to be closing in on the small path. I looked left, I looked right, I even backed up, but the only way was forward. I positioned the 4Runner the best I could, pulled in the mirrors, and crept forward. With encouragement and spotting from Joker, we squeezed the truck through the trees to the sound of creaking and groaning that I can only imagine was last heard when the titanic sunk. I do not know how wide my vehicle was (measurement “x”) but the path between the trees was x-1 inches in width, as later evidenced by a rather broad dent on my passenger quarter panel. Alas, victory was won and celebratory PBR was soon at hand. The following Monday, a third caver, Ashley Lewis joined this small rambunctious cohort and the Monday Club was formed. With lessons learned from the previous Monday and the 4Runner in shambles, we set off for the off-road track in Jokers Ford. Not surprisingly, a near catastrophic amount of metal was unsheathed from the passenger side of the cab and bed after trying to desperately maneuver around a tree while neglecting the limits on the turn radius of this monster of a vehicle. This “accident” was later determined to have been a valuable insight into the rust damage accumulating in that general area and thus accelerated his ability to repair the truck. With a few donkey kicks from beneath the truck and some profuse apologizing to Ellen Crowder we retired four wheeling for a while.
After several weeks of vehicular repair, this threesome decided we could get into less trouble if we just went caving. Following an old lead near James cave, we began our mission by entering a promising cavern that, while dry today, appeared to take a whole stream recently. We gathered our tools, picked a point of attack and began to dig. After 6 hours all we had to show was a pile of logs, a pile of trash, and a pile of dead animals (rest in peace). After a short break for Taco Bell bean burritos we continued until we penetrated a small opening. With desperation and impatience we began to try to cram ourselves into this restriction. With a shove from above, I was able to enter the passage. A whole new world! A place, none of us had ever been. Simply amazing; until the passage choked to a fist sized hole after about 25-30 ft.
After a hiatus of several months, we reunited for a Monday trip, this time at another lead in the James Cave area. Joker and I brought on an additional caver, and former VP, Dustin Schleifer. After purchasing a digging bar from the Rural King we made our way to another hole under a tree. While the passage was wide and had some mild airflow, it was lacking in overhead cover and pitched downward. With a couple hours of digging a penguin slide, I was able to squeeze down the shoot and drop into a passage. Another awe inspiring moment. Surreal, somewhat scary. Was there booty to be scooped? I called for the men to follow but alas a rather
