I don't quite have everything yet but it's almost there! Here's my recommendation for splitting up
gear:
Front Bag
- Boots, possibly sticking out the top
- Phone (for strava)
Left Pannier
- Helmet
- Food
Right Pannier
- Change of clothes
- Water
Strapped to top or rear rack:
- cave bag
I haven't gotten a chance to test this out yet thanks to the Coronavirus, but look out for an
update next year!
