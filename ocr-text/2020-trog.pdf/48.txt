• Hungover before caving: Becca, Holly, and Beth are all hungover before the trip. Sketch,
you want to feel your best especially if it's a day or several day trip.
Sam wears a watch. This is a safe practice so that you know how long you have been in
the cave and if you need to head back early to meet sign out BUT
THERE IS NO SIGNOUT. The six friends go without telling anyone that they are going or
using a sign-out. This is not safe at all.
They are in a national park. They have not received permission from anyone to be in the
cave, and do not know if anyone else is in it. This is not safe.
Juno leaves the book of cave maps in the car. This is not safe, you should always have
a map unless it is a cave you and another are very familiar with. Honestly, it's a good
idea to bring a map anyways.
No one is wearing seatbelts on this winding off road. Wear your damn seat belt.
Safety talk: Sarah gives a safety talk on the way to the cave. Safe BUT it should feature
more of cave conservation and actual safety, not just bad shit that can happen.
Rigging is not really seen but looks a little sketch.
Second lights: Not everyone has a second light, and the ones that do have a flashlight.
This is not practical and not safe.
Juno lights a flare in the middle of the cave. She also yeets it off a cliff. This is bad for
cave conservation and potential bats.
Juno and others jump from place to place in the cave. Not safe for people or the cave.
Stopping for a snack break: safe but an apple isn't very calorie dense and you also have
to pack out the core. They should have brought more calorie dense foods with minimal
wrappers, especially since this is such a long trip.
Holly is the first one to go into the tight crawl space. She has never been caving before,
so why is she going first? Juno or Sarah should have led. Not very safe.
Holly hears the rocks rumbling but fails to tell the others and says it's clear. Not safe.
Juno decided to lead them in an UNKNOWN cave when everyone thought this was
Boreham caverns. WTF NO. Never go exploring in an unknown cave without others who
are very experienced, and don't lie to your friends and tell them it's one cave when it's
really another.
Beth keeps unclipping her helmet strap. Not safe, especially after that rock fall.
Juno lights another flare. Not safe.
• Beth drops a rock and doesn't say rock. This is inconsiderate to the CHUDs.
