When I stumbled into Smythe 146 for the first time, I had no clue what I was getting myself into. There were so many people, it was chaotic, loud, and confusing. I had absolutely no clue what was happening, but I did my best to understand everything that was going on. By the end of the meeting, I somehow got on my first trip to Starnes, with Maddie as trip leader. I would later be terrified by her driving skills. At the time, the Starnes entrance descent was one of the hardest things I had ever done. It was soon replaced when I had to climb out. Despite the terrifying canyoning, I laughed more in the few hours in that cave than I had during the first weeks at Tech. I wanted to come back, even though I was a little terrified to do so. In the coming weeks, after proving I could tell people what it was two weeks in a row, I became a member of the Trog committee, kicking Landgraff to the curb, and replacing Chad as the main Trog speaker at meetings. My reign of sassiness telling people to do their damn Trogs began.
At the writing of this, I’ve been on 20 cave trips. I have a distinct memory with every trip I’ve ever been on. Some highlights: - Seeing the “flowers” in Clover Hollow and witnessing the nicknaming of Gummy Nathan - Getting stuck in the Filter in Links for twenty minutes and almost throwing up then participating in a gummy war - Being led on what felt like a wild goose chase in DMC by Delafield - Climbing probably one of the sketchiest climbs at the waterfall in New River - Going through the tightest crawl ever at Hancock and getting tiny rocks stuck in my ear (courtesy of Taren) - Being semi-terrified when finding a demon baby, zombie person, and fake skeleton on my second trip to Giant - DOING LINKS WITHOUT GETTING STUCK - Being one of maybe a few dozen people to see the horizontal part of Fern (now my favorite cave) and climbing out to find a pandemic had been announced. - Activating my short people powers in Tumbling Rock
Despite all the fun in the caves, the activities done aboveground are some of the best memories I have at Tech. The potlucks and speleos are filled with the chaos that seems to follow cavers around, debauchery, smiles, scary movies, and laughter.
The people in VPI, young and old, in my opinion, are some of the best people on this campus. Through the months, I never once felt alone, which is a little bit of a surprise. It's been one of the few places I’ve felt like I belong to. And I have everyone reading this to thank for that.
