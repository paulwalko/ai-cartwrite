Beginner’s Luck
A trip report from the CRF New Year’s Expedition to Mammoth Cave, Kentucky
By W.F. Koerschner
There is a bolt climb objective in the Roppel portion of Mammoth Cave that I had been pondering for 20 years. The north end of the 20Wx5H Ursa Avenue ends at a shaft that bisects the passage preventing access to the possible continuation. Bob Alderson had planned to climb it during the CRF New Years Expedition but he was struck down by illness and had to abort at the last minute. I knew of a dig nearby that had the potential to bypass the climb and decided to check that first.
Upon arrival at Hamilton Valley I consulted with expedition leader Ed Klausner as to who he could give me for the Ursa Ave trip. He suggested Mandy Harris and her boyfriend Matt Domeraki, but he cautioned me that Matt had never been caving before at all. Roppel has a reputation for killing noobs, so he was justifiably concerned but left it to me to decide. Mandy really loves caving and was eager to share the underground world with Matt. She wanted Matt to get on a good trip and I could see the pleading look in her eyes. Matt is long, lanky and strong so no problem physically, but would he wig out mentally? I described the trip to him – 10 to 12 hours, 1000 ft of stooping / crawling, dryish, a few squeezy bits but otherwise pretty mellow by Roppel standards. He was totally calm and I could tell that nothing was going to ruffle this guy so I took a chance on him.
We entered the Weller Entrance to Roppel Cave at 10:35 AM and proceeded out Walter Way to Goes Canyon and stooped / crawled in from J1 to J26.
We first surveyed the lead to the left at J26 (JR-Survey from J25) which is a 3hx8w tube. At JR2 a trickle infeeder joins from the right, past which the tube fills. Above JR2 there is a relatively easy hole up into a narrow walking canyon crossing overhead. On the wall of the canyon above the hole is a smoked arrow, labeled ‘IN’, pointing to the right. We took the survey paleo-downstream to the west (left) to JR5 where the canyon splits into a twisty slot above and a crawl below that are both impassable.
Next, we surveyed east from JR2 to JR7 where we intersected the survey route of Goes Canyon coming up from J27 below. Here the canyon has an additional 12Hx1W upper component that departs paleo-downstream but is too narrow to follow. The JR-survey route is clearly preferable to laying on your side in the water and squeezing up through the heinous slot above J27. I wish I had known this thirty years ago so I could have avoided 20 odd trips through this nasty obstacle.
Past J27 is about 100 ft of floorless ‘death slot’ that Matt admitted he “did not like” very much, but he did it. We followed Goes Canyon to its termination at the J42 Dome (the bolt climb lead) where we climbed up to the left and doubled back into Ursa Avenue.
We replaced the first shot of the old K-survey from J46 to K1 and then turned into the N-survey where we reshot N1 to N6, and N8 to N11 to hunt down blunders that cause bad
