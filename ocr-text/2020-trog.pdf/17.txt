TAG spring break trip summary in the form of what could potentially
be described as an epic poem if you were to squint at it
By Alex Corrigan
Monday:
Hang em high was Monday,
rather a fun day.
We traversed fields and woods and small cliffs to find the cave
Even though we nearly lost Monty in the woods on the way.
Many of the rappels were shoestrings,
uncomfortable, mildly alarming things
On which sometimes a croll wouldn't catch,
Little slips in the latch,
Which is alarming to say the least.
However, we found many magnificent beasts in the cave
Salamanders of glorious splendor
Long and orange with spots rivaling the stars
Small and yellow, shy and with bars of color
Tan with stripes and small and dark
They're truly remarkable creatures.
We came out of the cave to a sunset
but hiked back in the dark.
With coyotes howling and crickets and peepers, we made our way back to the start.
Alas the rain continued, the hot tub could not be revived.
Although heartbroken we managed to survive.
Tuesday:
The rain continued on and off the entire week.
'Twas cloudy, and painfully bleak.
But on the way to Valhalla we fit all of us nine
In Nathan's dad's truck and that was a time
All the way up the road in the truck
We hit potholes and stones and mud and muck
With Nathan in the drivers
Other Nathan and Ariel in passenger
Pete in a back seat and Rowan on the floor, Chad in the middle back, myself on Meredith's lap
And Monty on the center console, head poking out of the sunroof, smacking his helmet with
every bump.
A hammock was set up as a refuge near the pit,
With many of us hiding under the tarp above it.
200ft down we found mushrooms, fossils, and a bat
We looked up at the sky and wondered that
The rain had briefly stopped for us.
200ft up, then hauling gear back to the car
