Valhalla - Impressive
"Ever been there?"
"Been where?"
"Valhalla"
"Valhalla... 'The Hall of the Gods'."
"Oh, never heard of it."
"Then let me tell you about it."
Stiffled yawn, "Do you have to?"
"Winston Harmon, Doug Perkins, Twila Youngman, and

running her mouth about her relatives and Doug was always...
well, let me get back to Valhalla,
"Yawn"
"When we arrived we had a great time driving around
the Alabama countryside, supposedly looking for certain
caves. Many miles and two days later we found ourselves
walking up a trail to Valhalla, We walked and walked and
walked some more. 'You sure this is the right way, Winston?'
'Yea, I'm sure (I think).'"
"Yawn"
"And then we were there. There was already a group
fron Florida there, Winston peered down the drop from an

The rope disappeared in a mist making the drop look very,

"Z Z Z Z Z...."
"Winston managed to croak out two words, 'O my!', and
chewed on his fingers, like he does, when he said it..
Several minutes later, when he regained his composure, he
said in a very high pitched voice, 'We have to go down there?
o my! Impressive, very impressive! Har!, har! har!"
"Z Z Z Z ..."
"Are you listening?"
"Huh? Oh, yeah, Yawn,"
