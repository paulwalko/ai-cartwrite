of the known, significant caves in the valley,
all but Miller's? Spence and Seabolt occur along this
strip of exposed limestones, which is made up of exposed
limestones, which is made up of the Knox Group and the
limestones immediately above it. That is, in a narrow
strip of limestones, some 70 miles long, on the north-
western flank of Walker Mountain, there occurs ten signif-
icant caves, averaging 6,165 feet long and 188 feet deep.
Of these ten caves, five occur within a two mile segment
of the 70 mile strip. (Skydudky Hollow System and Coon
Cave) The rest are widely scattered along the remaining
68 miles,
In 1963-64 a group of VPI cavers spent several
weekends checking out one short segment of this strip
and found four new caves, averaging some 700 feet and
left several small leads. In the spring of 1970 the
Grotto project was to check a two mile area immediately to
the east of the Skydusky Hollow System and nothing.
of significant was found. Most of the strip has been
checked, but very little has been checked intensively.
The areas that have been checked intensively sometimes
have yielded nothing new and sometimes a great deal, .
Obbiously there is more cave there, though it may take
considerable work to find it. So far the work has been
quite rewarding. A fantastic amount remains. The work
to date would indicate a great deal of cave remains
to be found.
There are those who say Virginia is worked out.
My own response is "Ha!"

1-Miller's Cave is formed in the same limestones but
not in the same strip of exposure.
