1971
BANQUET 1971
Banquet Weekend offically began on Friday Febru-
ary 19 at 11:59 AM when a brass band and six thousand
screaming coeds met Jack Stellmach (our honored banquet
speaker) at Roanoke A "rport, Would you believe the entire
Ladies Auxilliary, accompanied by two twelve-strings
and a fiddle, singing "We Love You Jack"? How about three
cavers trying not to let it be too obvious that they were
waiting for the weird looking character in a multi-colored
beret (with pompom) with thick bushy muttonchops and
wearing a gold earring?
Anyone who has attended a VFI Banquet Weekend knows
that Friday night is when the real festivities start,
The Meeting was met with droves of some old and not so old
faces that were great to see, maybe even if you didn't
know the people that went with them. The General Slide
Show afterwards (complete with audio) brought back some
of the past Happenings of the club. Included were :
Lewd Scenes From OTR 1970, Daring Caving Expeditions,
Subversive Activities of 3rd Floor Pritchard, Not So
Daring Caving Expeditions, etc., etc. Somehow the party
managed to work itself over to the Carbide Dump, where
the festivities wildly staggered on into the wee hours,
ending who knows where,
On Saturday the Evac Dog smiled upon us and gave
us a beautiful day, very rare in Blacksburg in the winter,
This could even be looked upon as a good omen, for the
Convention Meeting, which convened much too early in the
morning, went smoothly.
Later on, towards evening, a monumental first
happened. Yes, that's right, oid Timers, a cocktail party!
It's not so much that the VPI.Grotto is plugging for a
place in the Jet Set, it was decided that it was a good
idea to give people the opportunity to get sociable early
in the evening.
The Banquet itself was held at Squires Student Center
and from most appearances, was quite successful. After
the fine repast, v√§cks and tellmach presented us with stories
of experiences from some of his seventeen NSS Conventions,
The tales were too numerous to elaborate on here and
Jack told us that he had many others and to hear more,
we could either catch him at the party or invite him
back again!
Then came the awards,
The Indecisive Decision Award went to Boots Good
to help her in making future decisions,
