THE TECH TROGLODYTE

earlier to do some surface work on the rim of the
quarry, found signs indicatint earthquake activity, and
looking down through one of the larger crevices, saw the
light of one of her fellow cavers, With courage un-
bounded, she tested the boulders around the crevice, as
gravel and sod slid through the holes into the silence
below. Hearing Janet's voice, she climbed down closer
to the edge of the quarry to find Janet at still another
entrance. Passing out the tape to Boots for measurement,
the crew completed the brunton and tape survey of Erheart's
Cavern,
Emerginginto the twilight of the Blacksburg
evening, the team happily headed for the cars and home-
proud in their accomplishments and feats of skill. For
like all good cavers, they knew they could look forward
to many glorious hours of partying.
The indescribable wonders found in Erheart's
Cavern napped out to a total length of 173 feet and
8 inches, at total depth of 50 feet. There were 10
stations set and the group accumulated, to the honor
and glory of VPI Grotto, five whole man-hours under-
ground.

CAVE GOD and EVAC DOGS.
..
And on the sun day the great Cave God realized that
the stuff he was doing was causing paper work that cluttered
his desk. He summoned Evac Dog and commanded that the
papers be arranged in some mystrical order so that he and
Evac Dog would know the method. Evac Dog, after many
formations, decided the post obvious would be the most
inconspicuous and recommended to Cave God to use the
alphabet,
Cave God was overwhelmed, "Beautiful Evac Dog, now
all we do is create an alphabet."
And it came to pass that in a little town of Karst
County that many things were filed. Four black and
darkly alphabetized file drawers, the sacred topos, one
forbidden folder, and three flimsy cardboard files.
