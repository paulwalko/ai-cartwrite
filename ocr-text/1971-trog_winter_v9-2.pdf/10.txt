circuits within the body (E) take the needle orientation
with a lunar environment and correct it to North Pole garth
based directional components. It is powered by the radi-
ation picked up by the detector (C) and has a half-life
of 600 years, Unfortunately, there is very little scien-
tific evidence to support if the overall operations of the
Broughton-Brunton will be effective that long.
To satisfy the y and 2 components of the instrument
orientation in a near weightless environnent, the research
tean has developed a unique leveling-clinometer system (F).
If the y and 2 components are satisfied when the bubble-
tube is spun about a 360 degree rotation, the bubble will
concentrate at the central axis, indicating it is oriented
to a horizontal earth basis. when this is the case, the
declination is read off the scale below.
Excess radiation is channeled away from the instrument
through part G. At this point a special radiation sensitive
dye is incorporated to leave a spot approximately eight 1!.
inches below the instrument for use as a survey station
marker,
Field Test Analysis:
Use of the odel 2 was tested under lunar conditions
mapping lava tube no, 4232 at lunar coordinates N24-46-578
in the Esmeralda Crater quadrangle, Figure 2 is the first
surveyed and published lunar cave map. The Broughton-
Brunton held up to the Standards demanded at the onset of
the expedition. Tests were taken on the resistance to lunar
micro-peteorite impact danage while underground. Statis-
tical analysis of the data indicates that meteorite inpact
upon the movable parts of the Broughton-Brunton is inversely
proportional to the distance from the entrance. However,
further tests are being taken at this time to deternine the
relative absence of micro-meteorites in the speleo-lunar
atmosphere and there influence on creating a continually
shifting gravitational stability field. Additional tests
will be carried out in the near future to determine the
influence of a shifting gravitational focal point on the
accuracy of readings,
