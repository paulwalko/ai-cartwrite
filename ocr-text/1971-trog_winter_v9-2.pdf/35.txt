With boundless energy the four leaped up the
bank of boulders and onto the railroad track that
ran past the quarry. Springing from rock to rock on
very brink of the quarry chasm, they finally spied the
yawning blackness of the sinkhole, entangled by lush
vines and brambles.
Fearlessly the four entered the twilight zone of
Erheart's Entrance Room, Little heeding to our words
of warning, Janet pushed still further into the dark
recesses of the unknown. Following with one dying
flashlight, Boots took lead tape, as Guy prepared to
toke notes, Mike, with skill and accuracy seldom achieved
