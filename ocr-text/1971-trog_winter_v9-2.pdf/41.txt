1750' of previously mapped passage was pushed to 8000'.
Buddy Penley's Cave, with 2000' was pushed to 7300'.
Exploration and mapping trips into the lower level
averaged 14 hours,
And the challenge continues to expand. The true
extent of Newberry-Banes is only now beginning to be
realized as remapping continues, 17,000' have been
surveyed to date, Paul Penley's Cave, with 300' of
previously known passage, has been pushed to one mile
and each survey trip continues to find more virgin cave.
The last four survey trips into the newly discovered
lower level have averaged 13 hours.
As a result of these surveys, it has become appar-
ant that these four caves - Bane's Spring, Newberry-
Banes, Buddy Penley's, Paul Penley's - are part of one
system - the Skydusky Hollow System (See TROGLODYTE, Vol.VII
No. 3). Total length of these four caves is approaching
nine miles,
In the far western end of the valley, Spence
and Seabolt are being explored further and remapped.
A new and promising cave has been located near there, but
has not been completely explored,

Straley's Cave
There is a second cave, several hundred feet long
immediately east of the second entrance, and less
than 20 feet away. Obviously part of the system.
