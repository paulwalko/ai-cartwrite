WINTER
THE TECH TROGLODYTE_1971
The black drawers were arranged in typical Cave God
fashion. The top one contained secret documents such as
the Tech Troglodyte in a complete collection, all the
self-incriminating minutes from the War Trials held since
the 40's, plus other nose running items as the sign out
sheet, Grotto Grapevine and all other documents that have
to do with the drunken organization of BULCEVACIPV,
In drawer 2 (which could be drawer B so as to be in
alphabetical order) one finds many secret maps of the
underground world, some mystrically snowed with unexplainable
symbols. and others neatly cluttered with artificial sloppy
hand writing explaining the depth of Cave God's domain,
Beyond the poorly folded sunfaded maps are all the unstolen
docuements that shall one day be used to free cavers from
the eternal lightness secretly named NSS stuff (NSS means
Never Slightly Seen stuff). Such scrolls as the News and
Bulletins. And as an added attraction more important
minutes from the judge's room in Tar Eloh Cave off the
BOG (Brothers of God).
In file 3 (or C) contains banned underground books
that are in Evac Dog collection. Speleo Digests lead the
list of books that "ware your pants out from the inside,"
It is one of those books put out annually that come out
only to shame cavers around the world. These were written
about Cave God by the followers of his preachings. There
are two other books that have sticky pages (and when left
alone fall open to the smuttiest parts in then) called
Caves of Virginia and Caverns of West Virginia. To read
the articles in this file one must sneak in the file room
and quietly steal them. So far, not many cavers have
been successful.
In the bottom file (or top, depending on the mood
the Cave God is in) there is a big pile of extra stuff,
valuable only as information for cavers to use against
land owners. These contain locations of caves that
cave owners have even forgotten. This is the most import-
ant unused part of the great magic black files, because
here one can find caves that only Cave God and Evac Dog
reveal at the Friday night orgies, knowing full well that
nobody is listening.
In the folder of sacred topos are such foldouts as a
73 minute quad of the karst country (72 minute means that
it is as long as you can look at one before some idiot asks,
"what dat". And more confusing 15 minute quads that give
you more time to look at it, because it is sprinkled with
less detail.
