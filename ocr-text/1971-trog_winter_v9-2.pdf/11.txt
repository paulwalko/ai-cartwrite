THE TECH TROGLODYTE

LOST WEEKEND
"Aren't you guys up yet?" a voice broke the peaceful
chill of a crisp November morning. Winnie turned over,
grunted, numbled under his breath "Damn Trainee", and
slowly pulled his bag snugly around his head. "Aren't you
going to get up? It's time to get going--get caving?" Oh
the pain! who can think of crawling around in the puck and
damp at 6:30 in the morning, especially while your ears are
frozen to the back of your head?
Like a truely dedicated trainee, I followed Winnie's
lead and pulled the warm bag tightly around my ears,
However, some things the most dedicated of procrastinators
can't ignore and just then a huge tractor trailor flew past,
rattling every frozen bone in my body. That did it--I'in
awake, in time to see Ed kichardson darting across the 20
feet of land that separated our humble group from the
infamous and frankly, rather noisy foute 11.
what a night, what a trip! I knew it held great
pronise for a profusion of misfortune, we already had a
great start. It wasn't enough that the four of us had
left Blacksburg with a trunkful of food and only Perkin's
Boy Scout mess kit to cook it in, but some girl had remembered
to pack her fingers to eat it with, and somewhere between
Chatanooga and Interstate 72 we had gotten sidetracked
onto the senic route 11 approach to Huntsville, via Georgia,
And there we were canped out on the Alabama-Georgia line
with a seranade of tractor trailers and speeding cars to
lull us into a shallow and all too short sleep.
Okay; I'm awake, but still fighting the overwhelming
urge to get up, right? Suddenly a bag next to Winnie
started contracting and gave birth to a face that somewhat
resembled our illustrious Vice President after Speleo-go-go,
"want me to go get the stove and food?' Oh, for
eager trainees! Winnie pulled out the key, handed it to
Ed, grunted one last protest and slowly crawled out from
his cacoon, Ladies and Gentlemen, isn't that the kinda
stuff that made VPI great? We were all up then, fixed
some P&J sandwiches, made some coffee and proceeded to
figure out just where we were. (of course a large "Welcome
to Alabana" sign 100 feet down the road helped.) Then we
were off to Huntsville and the nearest 29 cent Gas station,
Luckily we found both, and after about 15 minutes of driving
around in circles finally found Shelta Cave, We scouted
around for a potential camp sight for that night, held a
conference and decided that instead of cooking a turkey,
We would spend Thanksgiving Day doing Neversink Pit and
Gerry Self Pit. After all, hadn't winnie been to weversink
