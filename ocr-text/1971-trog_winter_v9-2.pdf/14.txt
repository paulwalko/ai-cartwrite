WINTER
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
11
While we were driving down a road we recognized the
Florida State car going the opposite direction so we
quickly altered our course and followed them to the cave.
A well worn path lead 2 miles up the mountain to the most
fantastic pit I've ever seen. Looking down the huge hole
all you could see were clouds of mist, and small flickering
lights, It wasn't too long before I realized that I
had forgotten something. Ever try to rappel 240 feet
without gloves? Winnie gave me another of those rather
pained expressions I had learned to expect and decided
that Doug would go down the drop first, prussik out, and
give me his gloves, All went according to plans, and
after Doug was off the rope, I pulled up the heavy rope,
rigged in, and after feeding the first 20 feet slipped
down to the floor. Aş Winnie did his famous head-first
single rappel a FSCC trainee standing behind me shouted
"Look at that guy!" "Yea", I said and ran off to find a
waterfall I heard, Winnie cammed out, and I followed
close behind on my prussiks. Just standing there looking
at Vahalla made it all worthwhile. We decided to drive
back to Knoxville that night and stay at Winnie's brother's
apartment. It rained all that night and the next
morning I woke to the sound of Winnie's footsteps. I
looked up and noticed a body still in his sleeping bag.
"Ah, ah! Aren't you up yet, Ed? You lazy bum, It's
time to get going--get back to Blacksburg!".
