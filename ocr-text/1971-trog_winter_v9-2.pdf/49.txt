WINTER
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1971
The bottle of Jack Daniel's Black Label was won
by the lucky number of Jim Hixson. The second prize,
a bottle of Cold Duck was won by Robyn Laffon,
By then, everyone was in the mood for a party
and party we did. There were such highlights as R. E.
Whittemore and his cohorts run across the street
to do lewd things on the golf course. There were also
fireworks, provided by the Corps for Military Ball, but
we didn't mind. We also watched Mike Kayes eat beer
cans and Jim Hixson impersonate a unicorn.
But wait until next year....
