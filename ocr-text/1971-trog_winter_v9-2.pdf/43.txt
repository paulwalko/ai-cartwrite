GEOLOGICAL REPORT OF THE VALLEY OF THE CAVES
To a casual observer looking at Charles Butts' Geolo-
gic Map of the Appalachian Valley in Virginia (1933), the
conclusion would be, "What a wierd looking map!" To an in-
tent geologist, or a person with an interest in geology, one
of the conclusions might be about an orange and white slash-
ed strip that winds its way from Newcastle down beyond Sky-
dusky Hollow in Bland Co, on into Tennessee. This strip of
orange is described by Butts as the Beekmantown group, In
the area concerned in this article, it starts at Newcastle
in Sinking Creed Mountain, coines down through Gap Mountain,
and into Big Walker Mountain which goes all the way to
Saltville,
Butts described the Lob (Lower Ordovician Period,
Beekmantown Group) in Pennsylvania as having three different
members, But when the Lob was traced into Virginia, it
became hard to distinguish between the different members,
Therefore it was just called the Beekmantown Group. At the
same time the LOb was known to be underlain by the Chepulte-
pec formation, a cherty dolomite of the Lower Ordovician
period. This fact and the existence of a major fossil,
Lecanospira, a flat-coiled snail, were the bases of corre-
lation of the strata throughout the valley.
However in more recent times, the Lov has been refer-
red to as the Upper Knox Group. It has also been divided up
into different members as shown by the chart, Cooper (1961)
described the Knox dolomite group as 2000 feet or more of
cherty and sandy limestone with one to three zones of fine
grained dolomitic limestones containing fossils.
