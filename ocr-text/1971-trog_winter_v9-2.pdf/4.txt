PRESIDENT'S COLUMN
With the continual increase in the number of people
who are caving, we are begining to incur some of the
additional problems which are to be expected in any sport
which experiences increasing participation. Increased
traffic in many caves, along with some irresponsible or
unknowledgable cavers, are causing landowner relation
problems. This problem is not due to a greater per-
centage of "problem" cavers, it is caused by the greater
number of cavers caving. This problem needs to be handled
on a local level. Each grotto should consider it a
responsibility to develop responsible cavers within its
ranks, This extends to the practice of becoming personally
familliar with the cave-owners, and extending them the court-
esies they deserve. Remember, it is not a God given right
to set foot on another man's land, I would say that an hour
spent doing something for the owner's benefit for every few
hours underground would not be too much. Spend time with
the owner, but, of course, do not get in his way, either.
i'iany cave owners would like to see slides of their caves,
and any speleological work being done in the cave would
probably be of interest to hin.
I would also like to encourage participation in the
Virginia Region. It is to your advantage to attend Region
functions. In this way, you, can become familiar with
people from other grottos, and also become familliar with
some of the problems and also good points of other grottos,
When caving in another area, I would encourage trying to
meet or contact some of the cavers in a local grotto. Some
bad scenes in caving can be avoided by admitting to yourself
that you may not know some of the particulars about a cave,
and about a landowner situation, It is certainly less
embarrassing to find the facts before you get there, rather
than to find them from the cave owner.
Friendship and fellowship inherent in cavers should
spread between grottos as much as possible, for it is the
individual grottos forming a region which will control the
future of caving, The Virginia Region will be assuming an
increasing role in the future of this area, I say this
because the ISS is not equipped to handle local problems,
nor was it meant to be. The burden of the caving community
lies with the region, and with the grottos in the region.
So coordination between grottos will become increasingly
important,
I hope it does not sound as if I am harping on caving
problems. There are good points to make about the future of
caving. Interest in speleological disciplines is going up,
I feel, and will continue to do so. Now that a large pro-
portion of the known caves have been explored and charted,
the time is coming to start doing something with what we have.
