THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1971
"As we started to rig in, a girl from the Florida
group had descended and announced that she was about
thirty feet from the bottom and at the end of the rope,
We then rigged in our rope next to theirs and the girl
then rigged prussiks into our rope and reversed prussiked
down to the bottom, Her calmness, throughout the
incident, impressed us thoroughly. Well, what do you think?"
"Z Z Z Z , Huh"
"What do you think?"
"About what?"
"Valhalla"
"Yawn, never heard of it."
"Oh, what's the use?".

Erheart's
Erheart's Cavern can be found near a limestone
quarry in Montgomery Co., Va. The following is an actual
account of the fearless exploration and precision survey
of this wondrous cavern--its massive breakdown room, its
impressive formations, its spine-tingling exposure traverses
and climbs, its bottomless and eternally black pits, and
its four entrances, with the magnificent teamwork lying
behind the discovery of each,
The afternoon of Dec. 12, 1970 saw most VPI cavers
attending a 1971 Convention planning meeting, and looking
forward to a typical party night of wine, women, and song..,
or beer, women, and song, or wine, beer, and song,
(dependent completely on personal tastes and desires).
What better activity for a caver to participate in? Why,
daring and heroic cave exploration, of course, And so, at
the completion of the meeting, the fickle flush of fate
flawnted its fishy finger at Guy Turenne, Mike Kayes,
Janet Queisser, and Boots Good, all of renowned VPI
Cave Club spelunking fame. Struck by the survey-bug,
these four headed for Erhearts, in search of adventure
and fortune under the great out-of-doors.
Arriving in the vicinity of the quarry the frolicking
foursome donned what caving attire they could find, which
wasn't much. With bravery little recorded in the annals of
caving history, Mike, Janet, and Boots planned to enter the dark
uncertainty of the bowels of the earth in their street clothes,
Guy, Boyscout that he is, was well prepared , hardhat and lamp.
