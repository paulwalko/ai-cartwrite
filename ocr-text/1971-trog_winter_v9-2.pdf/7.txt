LETTERS TO THE EDITOR:
Dear Sditors,
Very glad to see Vol. 9 1 - it's been a couple years
and we stopped sending the Caver,
But what's all this about portable carbide dumps and
having to fight plastic bags and so on? why not simply car-
ry your spare carbide in extra bottons like we do out here?
You just change bottoms and automatically take it home,
Best to all,
Dr. William Ã­. Halliday
P.S. Hope to see everyone at the 71 Convention - but better
start planning now to corne Northwest in 72 - for variety?
Looks like the best ever!!!

ANSWER TO LETTER TO EDITOR:
Thanks for pointing out an alternative that I have
used previously but neglected to include in the article,
As you point out, spare carbide lamp bottoms prove a
means of carrying out spent carbide. It also is quite ef-
ficient since the same container is used for taking in car-
bide, It makes shanging carbide much faster, especially if
no light is available or the lamp is flooded.
Let's compare requirements for the two pethods: spare
bottons versus baby bottles. Assuine a 12 hour trip at 2
hours per charge, Carbide needs will be 4-6 charges, with
2-4 charges for safety margin, or 8 charges total,
Spare_Lamp Bottom
Baby Bottles
Bulk:
8 bottoms
2 baby bottles
(1 for good carbide
1 for spent carbide
Veans of
carry:
pack
Hang on belt, etc,.
Cost:
3.75x8=16,00
$.40x2=1.80
Obviously, for a shorter trip, and 12 hours is not an
average trip for most cavers, the bulk for the spare bottoms
method is less than indicated, but the bottoms still must
be carried, probably in a pack. The cost is as great as the
capacity needed for the longest trip taken, not the average.
Each system has advantages and disadvantages, Any one
system can not be considered the ultimate for every person
or situation. Each caver must choose the system which suits
him or her (or it?).
Hey out there, any more suggestions?
