BROUGHTON - BRUNTON: STANDARD MODEL NO, 2*
Technical Research Report X-8N48986
*Arctic Patent Pending
Introduction:
For more than a year the Broughton-Brunton Standard
Model No. 1 has found wide acceptance in exploration and
surveying of Virginia's Great Dismal Swamp peat caves,
Since man has extended his environment to the moon, Homo
spelunkus has been thrust upon the new part of the last
frontier, the lunar underground. Not to withstand the over-
burdening weight of progress, the Equipment Research team,
a permanent sitting committee of the Virginia Tech Cave Club
has developed the Broughton-Brunton standard design to meet
lunar specifications, as established by the Federal Arctic
Commission on Surverying Standards and Instrumentation,
Specifications:
The most distinctive feature about the new design was
the removal of the Butane gas jet from Model No, 1. Current
scientific astrological observations on the lunar surface
indicate insufficient amounts of oxygen and neon in the at-
mosphere to support a live flame. As a result, the Model
jjo. l's ability to burn through the peat walls is unapplic-
able under the lunar surface. Because of the scientific
error range of statistical probability, however, it is pos-
sible that the lunar speleologists will uncover sizable per-
contages of rare gases, including oxygen and neon, under-
ground. The distance from the entrance is theoretically
calculated to be greater than three earth miles as express-
ed by the calculation:
I'lllll -
- dx - P(f(c)) + 1
sin√≥
where p is the probability of findins 20,5 oxygen trapped in
a lunar cavity as a function of the distance f(x) from the
entrance. (note: f(x) goes to infinity if there are more
than one entrance). Further elaboration of the third der-
rivative of the entegration of the above function, as well
as its implications, are in a previous Technical Research
Report of the connittee.
P(f(x)) = (+0x3t
The new jodel No.2 (figurel) has a built in 100 foot
measuring wire (A) one millimeter in diameter. A special
gold-aluninun alloy has been used for the survey wire as
well as the coinpass housing to prevent magnetic deflections.
At the end of the wire is a ganna ray source (B). When
lined up with a revolutionary new radiation detector (C),
a red light blinks (D) indicating that vector component x
has been aligned.
The unique feature of the Broughton-Brunton is that
all directions are converted to earth-based directions,
rendering lunar maps of some use to interested scientific
personnel on the Earth, Miniaturized transistor-alplified
