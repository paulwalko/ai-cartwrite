several places. There are few side passages, One runs
into the water table and the others end rather
unspectacularly within a few yards.
Beyond the end of the mapped region, the breakdown
approaches the ceiling. Over the breakdown is another
150 foot or so of cave before it finally fills,
Rexrodes doesn't go anywhere, it doesn't do anything.
Its formations are interesting, but not spectacular,
However it is challenging and fun. If you enjoy verticle
work, then Rexrodes is your cave,

Special!!
We heard that A.I. Cartwright even registered in a
Physics class last quarter and was doing pretty well, but
owing to a rule of the college limiting the number of
absences he had to be dropped from the roll. That's a real
cave man for you,.. When he can't even stay above ground
long enough to attend classes,
According to the Sept. 1 1944 Grotto Grapevine, the
club was once considering building a bridge in Clover Hollow,
(Cartwright suggested a steal tubing job that could be
constructed over the 143' drop) to save about 6 hours on
every trip and they'd still be in top shape by the time
we hit the bottom of the drop-off.
There was an interest in getting National Geographic
Magazine to do an article on caves in the vicinity of
Blacksburg--or even Life to print 'Life Goes on a Cave Trip.'
