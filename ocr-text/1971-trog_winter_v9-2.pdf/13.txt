WINTER
THE TECH THOGLODYTI
1971
NOW Natural well is about as close to Huntsville as you
can get with a cave and not have the whole city fall into
it, and about as easy to find as Doug's sleeping bag, that
is if you have your trusty â€¢67 Convention Guide and someone
in the car who knows where it is. None of us did, obviously.
dowever, Lady Luck smiled on us again, and after about six
trips around Monte Santo fidge, we found the path leading
to the cave. We were the first ones there, and we grabbed
the best rigging point we saw. We were soon to be joined
by fellow cavers froin Indiana, indy City, and Florida State.
It was a regular convention. After thrilling the Indiana
people with his single brake bar descent, Winnie joined us
for a tourist trip through the cave. Now for the already
mentioned Geologically and scientifically oriented, I will
include a brief description of our observations. It was
rather similar to Neversink. However, it was a little
deeper, and possessed a bit more cave, some rather muddy
crawls connected a series of dome pits. After signing
the register, we started out, in time to see some caver
from Indiana do the 185' drop on a full rack and virgin
Goldline, We sat around getting into our rigs, watching
the Indiana caver struggle while a friend helped unknot
the rope, and went back up. This time it was decided that
since I was the only one without a cam ris that I should
be the last up. (A decided improvement on our decision
the day before.) Half-way up the drop I met another
Indiana caver on a full rack, and we had a nice conversation
as he fed and, I prussiked. Then, we decided to drive out
to TAG Fieldhouse, in Paintrock Valley, where, upon arriving,
some stupid girl remembered that she had forgotten her
coat back at Natural well. Winnie smiled with a rather
pained expression, and we all jumped back in the car for
a leisurely trip back to Huntsville, By this time, it was
dark, or nearly there. A quick trip down the hill didn't
produce a coat, but we were lucky enough to drive into a 3
foot ditch, as we drove up to the path. With the help
of providence, and a friendly neighbor, we managed to push
the car back onto the road and start out again.
Here it was decided that winnie, Doug, and Ed would
ditch me at my sister-in-law's place, and go to Shelta and
cool dinner. Around midnight they picked me up and we all
started out for Paintrock Valley, this time to stay the
night. We put our bags around the back, and rested soundly
until some particularly eagar cavers started making noise,
Prompted by Ed's insistance, I managed to get up, roll up
my sleeping bag and eat my breakfast, followed close by a
good stiff cup of coffee, Florida State came through with
a red coat and some information on how to find Vahalla
(they were going there themselves) and after making sure
I didn't forget anything, we started out.
