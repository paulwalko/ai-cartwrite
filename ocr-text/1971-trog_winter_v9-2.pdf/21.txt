finds a wonderland of crystal taking many beautiful shapes.
One form that impressed me was a butterfly with closed
wings, a very delicate structure that would catch the eye
of almost anyone, Looking further we also found soda
straws very well formed and in great numbers,
Upon going through a small crawlway one falls upon
a room of great splendor and beauty, the Christmas Room,
On the walls and ceiling of this enormous room, we found
pure white calcite crystals that sparkled like new fallen
snow. This was how the room received its name. Since the
rest of the group had looked over this room once before
they told me to do some exploring on my own. I discovered
that the room was sloping downward. Following it to the
end, I found that the crystals in the wall had formed a
small flower, a unique calcite formation, The Christmas
Room was truly an experience I will never forget,
Moving onward, through crawlways, chimneys, and a
bit of walking passage, we encountered on the wall of a
small crevice, the Worm Garden, This contained a great
number of hele.ctites coming up in odd arrangemaments, namely,
in the arrangement of a worm garden. This is another one
of the many impressive formations one always remembers
from Paxton's, No more than one hundred feet from the
Worm Garden we looked down on a novelty. The formation
of a cave had somehow been carved into the shape of a
camel. From here we finally decided to start back to the
entrance, but before our departure we had to look at one
more area of the cave, the Big Room. When finding this
room, one does not realize its actual size until climbing
to the top of a large slope. The vast size of the place
could be seen from here.
The entrance was still showing its tranquil beauty
of a waterfall when we emerged from the cave. Looking
back at what I had seen, I made a promise that one day I
would return to the splendor and beauty that was Paxton's
Cave,
