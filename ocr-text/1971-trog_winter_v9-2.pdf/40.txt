THE VALLEY OF THE CAVES
The road from Eggleston, in Giles County, Virginia,
west to Saltville, in Smyth County, Virginia, is not
an impressive road; nor is it, on the surface at least,
a significant road. For 78 miles. it snakes its way
through rural Southwest Virginia in the valley. inmediately
north-west of Walker Mountain. The valley is drained
by Walker Creek to the east and North Fork Holston River
to the west.
Driving along this road the opportunities which
this road provides are not apparent - old homes, rocky
fields - a mountain range which has blocked the flow of
prosperity from the east - Appalachia creeping in from
the west. The opportunities are hidden by the rocks and
yet are not a part of them; holes in the ground - caves,
Historically, the caves have been of little value
to the people of the area, To the west they had momentary
economic value as sources of saltpeter (Repass Saltpeter,
Tilson Saltpeter, Buchanan Salt peter). To the east,
they had a negative value, Clean, cool streams ran
down Walker Mountain toward the limestone pastures,
only to "sink" into the ground at the edge of the
fields. Local people sometimes dared to explore the
caves, invaribly to be stopped by a "bottomless" pit
or an "impassible" passage,
The caves of the valley were much more significant
to the world of the spelunker, In the 1940's and the
early 1950's, when organized caving was in its infanoy..
the valley was a proving ground for many of the eastern
cavers. They found and at least partially explored
at least 70 caves and mapped the ten most significant:
