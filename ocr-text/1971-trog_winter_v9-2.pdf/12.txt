before? Didn't we have our trusty '67 Convention Guide?
It shouldn't take much tine to yo-yo the 1650 Neversink
and have plenty of time for Gerry Self, right? After
spending all morning circling Scottsboro, we finally
located the Highway Department and a nap of the area,
and found out that we had been looking in the wrong area
entirely, however, after that, it was sinooth sailing to
the cave up the mountain (conviently marked by a waterpipe,
thank God) and to the cave. We rigged the rope, and while
Doug and winnie crossed over to the other side for pictures,
Ed and I rigged in. Now, for all those Geologists, and
scientifically minded amoung you, I will proceed to describe

without a can rig, of course I started out first. That

Once up, I set off to the car, and the typically feninine
job of fixing lunch. What else? P&J! Ed was close on

Back at Shelta, we attempted to locate a key to Shelta,
but a couple of hours and about 5 dollars in calls later,
decided that that was a lost cause also. It wasn't that
we hadn't written, but our letter was returned--insufficient
address, our luck still held! Back at Shelta, We cooked
dinner, (By this time, winnie had bought a pot in Huntsville.)
and went to sleep, full of aspirations for the coming day.
There we were in the middle of downtown Huntsville,
surrounded by miles of residential housing, urban, familiar,
far from trucks and cars, safe and secure, a great place
to get a great sleep, right? You already know the answer.
Someone's pet rooster even beat "Damn Trainee" up (and at
5 o'clock in the morning) and after about two hours of
"Ole sicDonald", the local dogs broke loose and it was all
over for another would be sleep,
"Aren't you up yet, you lazy buins?"

It's a good
Well, it was up and out, roll up the sleeping bags,
eat Ed's slightly burnt oatmeal, and off to lvatural well.
