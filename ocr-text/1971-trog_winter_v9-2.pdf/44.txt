THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1971
In the Wytheville-Pulaski area, the lower 1500-1800
feet is a banded magnesium limestone, impure cherty dolo-
mite, with several zones of rusty weathering quartz sand-
stones, Northwest of Walker Nountain, the lower part of
the Lok* is practically all dolomite. This dolomite is
the product of near complete dolomitization of limestone
which has almost crowded out the limestone lithology.
The upper part of the Lok is variable in thickness,
For example, in Giles County, the dolomite is less than
or equal to 300 feet thick. There are places where the
LOk is entirely absent due to previous tectonism**
It should be pointed out that dolomitic. lsme≈°tane
offers a very good possibility for caves because it
usually fractures easily. Obviously the Lok fulfils this
requirement. But the fact is, caves are formed along
joints and faults and they aren't going to be found just
anywhere in the LOk, In order to completely understand
the geology of the Lok and the caves in.in, a thorough
study would have to be made of the jointing and faulting
of the Knox Group thtoughout southwest Virginia,

IMPLICATIONS OR THERE'S MORE CAVE
IN THAT THERE VALLEY
In Layman's (caveman's) terms, the conclusion
that can be drawn from the preceding Geological Report
is simply that there occurs a layer, or bed of limestones
extending along the northwestern side of Walker Mountain
for the length of the valley. This bed is generally
quite thick and is composed, for the most part, of
dolomitic limestones. Such dolomitic limestone is
favorable for the formation of caves. This bed is not
flat lying and thus the end rather than the top of the
bed is exposed. As a result, the bed is exposed along
a relatively narrow strip,
