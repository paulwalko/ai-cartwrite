Double Brake Bar
As the name implies this is a version of singles
consisting of two singles rigs connected by a ring, chain
link, etc.
Advantages: The device is compact and lightweight
and inexpensive, Parts are easily replacable. It is
easily rigged and does not unlay and kink a rope to the
extent a single rig does. It can be used on drops of
greater depth than a single, and provides a greater amount
of control and safety.
Disadvantages: Care must be taken not to rig in
backwards as this could lead to complications, Heat
dissipation although better is still a problem on fast
descents, Care must be taken in negotiating overhangs to
insure the rope does not become derigged. The device
cannot pass knots and should be restricted to drops of less
than 250' depending on the users weight,
Carabiner Wrap
The carabiner wrap is the simplest of all mechanical
methods of descent. It consists of a single Carabiner,
preferably the locking type, Descent is controlled by
friction of the rope on the carabiner.
Advantages: This device is light-weight, inexpensive,
has multiple uses and is easily rigged. It can be rigged
in only one manner.
Disadvantages: The main disadvantage to this device
is that due to the sharp bends, there is a strong danger
of fiber damage, Being a wrap type device there is severe
kinking, spinning and unlaying of the rope, It should not
be used on drops of over 50';
Patten's Hook
The Patten's Hook is similar to the carabiner wrap
except there is an open side. It is simply a specially
bent piece of steel,
Advantages: It is easily rigged. It is lightweight
and inexpensive. It can also pass knots,
Disadvantages: Being made of steel, heat dissipation
is at a minimum, Being a wrap type device there will be
kinking and spinning. Tension must be constant to insure
the rope will remain rigged.
