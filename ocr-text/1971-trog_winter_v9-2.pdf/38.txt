THE TECH TROGLODYTE__
1971
The forbidden folder made of wood from the forbidden
fruit tree are the same maps that are in file 2 (or is it
file B) plus intermediate printers that can be used to make
more of the same stuff so as to polute the minds of new
cavers,
Housed in the flimsey cardboard files are the
exchange publications which we keep because we want other
Grottos to keep ours; only knowing that we really wonder
where (or why) they keep the trash we send them.
The above information was received from Evac Dog
when threats of removing all the fire hydrants from the
streets and fencing in all the elementary school yards so
he could not run around and be obscene in front of young
children and embarrass the teachers when the children ask
what he is doing. He made a promise to try to get more
people to use the great collection of papers so we could
collect more money to buy carbide with the fine money.

Major Rexrodes
Rexrodes Cave, W. Va.,. is an extremely interesting
and challenging cave, Although reported as only 450 feet
long, it offers quite a lot of verticle experience.
Most of the verticle work in Rexrodes can be done
without ropes however they are advised. Our trip took in
30 feet of Perlon, 150 feet of Goldline, 200feet Blue Water II,
235 feet of Sampson and over 100 feet of handlines, over 700
feet of rope, more than the total length of the cave,
Climbing skills, from chimneying to scrambling can be put
to use, There is little exposure and a beginner can gain
confidence there, but it is technical enough to please
those with experience,
There are several places which must be rigged. The
entrance slopes about 50 degree and ends in a 15 foot drop.
One of the pits near the rear spirals down and out of sight,
Many of the climbs can be lead, but it is much more con-
venient to fix a rope for the rest of the party,
Rexrodes layout is interesting. It is mapped as
450 feet long, in a straight line, The ceiling is level,
with large, rather impressive stalagtites. Breakdown has
covered the floor and nearly fills to the ceiling in
