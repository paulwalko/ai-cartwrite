SAVAGE CAVE WOMAN
Michael seemed determined to take me caving
this year, Bad weather saved me the first time we
planned to go. And then the next time Michael got sick
so we couldn't go caving. Wow! What a relief!
My doomsday finally arrived. Twelve cavers, in-
cluding me, packed up and went to Spruce Run Cave. We
arrived at the cave and hiked a short distance from
our cars to the entrance . The experienced cavers eag-

entrance and peered down as the others disappeared
