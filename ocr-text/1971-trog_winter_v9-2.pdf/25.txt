Peck Descender
Like the Allain Descender, the Peck is a specially
formed piece of aluminum,
Advantages: Being made of aluminum, heat is rapidly
disa pated. It is easily rigged and can be rigged only one
way. It can be used on long drops and will pass over knots,
Disadvantages: Being a wrap device there will be
spinning and a small amount of kinking, Tension nust be
kept on the device to keep the rope from slipping off. It
is a single use item,
Scaribiner
This is an adaptation of the classic body rappel in
which the rope instead of passing under one thigh passes
through a carabiner then over the shoulder and down the
opposite arm,
Advantages: The main advantage of this over the
body rappel is that there will be no burning of the
thigh in descent. This method is also inexpensive, It
is easily and quickly rigged.
Disadvantages: Like the body rappel this method
should be used only by a person experienced in rope work.
Belays are necessary on all descents. Free fall descents
result in large amounts of heat that have to be dissipated
over the back and in the case of the body rappel-the thigh,
Leather patches sewed in strategic spots will greatly
decrease the probability of burns,
There are other methods of descent similar to the
body rappel such as; French foot rappel and back rappel
but these are just adaptations of the body rappel, Also
there are many other mechanical methods such as; the
Fisher Ring, the Fireman's Hook, and three carabiner rig.
But, my intent is not to describe every method, just to
introduce the reader to some of the more interesting
methods. Also there is always someone with a "better idea",
one of these was the infamous Coke bottle rappel, but,
that is another story.
