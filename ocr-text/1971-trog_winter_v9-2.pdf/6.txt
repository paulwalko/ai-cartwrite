WINTER
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1971
If vertical work is not your bag, then there are
hundreds of easy to difficult horizontal caves. For times
when the convention may be a bit dull, I may be talked
into a trip through lower Tony's where, the great Cartwright
permitting, you can enjoy 300" of two foot deep humidity
in a three foot passage. If crawling in cold water is not
for you, then there are the miles of big dry passage in
Greenville Saltpeter, Laural Creek, Windy viouth, all in
West Virginia, There is also Butler's, Fallen Rock and
New River in Virginia,
If you are looking for cave life then pay a visit
to Beacon Cave, where a little bit of everything is to
be found. It is also worthwhile to bring your camera there,
For you photographers in the crowd, this area is a
must. Paxton's Cave alone is worth the trip. It has one
of the most profuse array of photographic material on the
East coast, with special permission and a good guide, there
can be pictures of gypsum needles, angle"s hair and gypsum
flowers in Butler's Cave, Virginia's longest, closer to
campus is Spruce Run Cave,
when you are really looking for something new and
exciting, try and catch a place on a Jim Hixson trip to
Warm River Cave, where you can cave in the nude in the 80Â°
water, ( there's even an old swimming hole )..
If caving is not a major item on your convention list,
then perhaps you'd like to participate in the midnight float
trip on the New River being planned by Doug Draves, or if
you'd prefer playing it safe you can wait until daylight
and shoot the rapids in that old standby the innertube.
Climbing skills can be sharpened on the local rock
faces of Fool's Face and Dragon's Tooth, or on your way
here or back, you can stop off at SenecaRocks in West
Virginia,
Perhaps you've heard of our parties. With such liners
as the Easter Pig Roast, or the 1970 float trip party disaster.
I'm sure we can come up with another (or two) at the
convention.
So even if you just want a change of scenery, and
there are some mighty pretty sights here, head East in June
1971, for eight days of the best Convention you will ever
attend. We've got all the right ingrediants except you.
