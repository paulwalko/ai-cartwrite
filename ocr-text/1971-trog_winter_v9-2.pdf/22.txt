THE TECH TROGLODYTE --- 1971
Various Descending Rigs Part II
This is Part II of an article which appeared in the
Spring 1970 issue of the "Trog". In this segment I will
present several more methods of rappeling. This list is
by no means complete nor do I profess to be an expert on
this subject. However, I an always interested in hearing
about new methods of rappeling. If the reader knows of
any I will be more than happy to hear about them,
J-Bar
Similar to an upside down rack, the J-Bar works on
the principle of constriction instead of relying mainly
on friction, It is designed for use on ropes of 3/8" to
1/2" in diameter. It is constructed of tubular iron and
break-bars,
Advantages: Rigging is not difficult and can be
done in only one manner. The device provides a slow,
easily controlled, spin free descent.
Disadvantages: Due to the large angle of bend put
in the rope, there may be fiber damage, Being constructed
of iron, the device is heavy and has poor heat dissipation
properties. The major wearing point cannot be easily
re placed. It cannot pass knots and functions with
difficulty on drops of over 400'.
Single Break Bar
This is one of the older methods of mechanical
descent, It consists of a brake bar and a carabiner, The
rope passes over the brake bar and around ones back...
Descent is controlled by wrapping the rope around the back
and stomach. For lighter persons or slow ropes it can be
controlled on the thigh,
Advantages: A primary advantage is the cost. A
decent rig can be purchased for about $2. It is light
weight and can be used for other things, It can also be
belayed from below, Rigging is simple,
Disadvantages: Care must be taken not to loose
control during the descent as it is almost impossible to
regain control. Heat is not easily dissipated. Singles
also tend to unlay a laid rope which results in severe
kinking, and spinning. It should not be used on
excessively long drops.
