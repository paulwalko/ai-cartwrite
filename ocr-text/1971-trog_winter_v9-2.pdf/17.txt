time to return to the outer world. And exit we did,
Two cavers, though, stayed way behind to rediscover the
cave, or each other, whichever the case may be. The cavers
ahead of me were fast and soon out of sight. I plodded
along at my own turtle pace, It wasn't long before I
came to the entrance. When I emerged from the cave
no one was in sight and it was raining. I hiked back
to to the car, changing into partially dry and clean
clothes on the way. I sat in the car waiting for the
rest of the group to get ready to leave. I was tired,
dirty and bruised, but a totally new person, I am now
a savage cave woman.

A CHALLENGE FOR KNOWLEDGE
I look over the edge,
I'm ready to rappel
The rope's been rigged, the knots been checked,
My swiss seat is tied, my biners are clipped.
I look over the edge,
In the darkness below.
The glow of my light on wet, gleaming walls,
Plays cahnging games as I begin to move,
I kick off the edge
Gripping the rope,
The buzz of rope over man-made steel,
Grows in my ears as I begin to move.
The walls flash briefly
In the glow of the flame,
The floor is below. The rope glows warm
on a gloved hand as my speed is slowed,
I rest on the floor
And stare with all wonder,
What will I find? What challenge awaits?
Into the unknown I must go on,
Probing the depths of darkness
To satisfy my thirst,
For the unbounded knowledge of the wherefores and whys
Into the darkness I must go on.
Probing the depths of darkness
To satisfy my quest,
For challenge and adventure,
Into the darkness I must go on,
