into the darkness, Michael encouraged me to go ahead,
I felt like a child that had been told that if he
dug a hole deep enough he would reach China. I felt
as if I were entering a world unknown to me before,
Several people had told me that this would be
an easy cave, They said it was small and had alot of
pretty formations in it. Fine, But they forgot to
mention the forty feet of crawlway at the entrance of
the cave, And when I say crawl, I don't mean crawl on
your hands and knees-I mean crawl on your stomach or
side, or whichever way you fit between the rocks best.
Have you ever crawled on your side around a 120 degree
turn? But onward I went into the depths of the cave
through streans and mud and rock. Finally we came to the
big room at the back of the cave. The room was shaped
like a stage with an orchestra pit. The walls on all
sides were filled with formations. The floor of the
stage was riddled with all sorts of odd formations,
Some of them lookedto me like sand ripples that you
would find on a snall deserted beach. There were
stalagmites on the stage also, A couple of the stalag-
mites were tilted, which is very unusual. Looking at
cave formations is like looking at clouds and making
them appear in your mind to represent something.
We twelve cavers were not alone in the cave,
There were numerous daddy long legs and crickets covering
the walls, I learned that cavers tend to exaggerate,
They kept exclaiming, "Millions! Millions of three lb,
spiders! Healthy three lb, spiders! "
Then other cavers would go into a very remote
part of the cave and call for you to come back too,
Beautiful formations they would say. I believed the lie
and followed into a crawlway. This particular crawl-
way led into a small room which had no formations,
but instead was filled five other cavers, I decided that
five in there were enough, so I turned around and went
back out.
Michael had told me that the temperature in
caves was about 54 degrees. Since I get cold easily,
I dressed warmly; four shirts, tights, kneesocks, jeans,
fleece lined boots and gloves, plus the essential hardhat,
Steam was beginning to rise off of my body. Perspiration
was rolling off my forehead. I had to remember not to
wipe my forehead with my glove covered hand, because
the glove was covered with mud,
I came to the conclusion that I had explored
all of the cave worth exploring People soon began to
emerge from the remote parts of the cave. It was now
