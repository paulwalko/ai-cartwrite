WINTER
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1971
Hydrological, geological, biological and other studies in
caves have just begun, and can be quite interesting, even
to a caver who is not trained in one of these areas. I con-
tend that you do not have to be a specialist in geology to
make meaningful geologic observations underground. I think
that with concentration and some reading and talking around,
one can find a long-term interesting project in speleology.
As a final remark, I would like to comment on the VPI
Grotto. A lot of cavers in the grotto seem to feel that the
grotto is not what it used to be. I would disagree with this
point. Of course, the grotto does not consist of the same
people that it used to, but a new group of cavers have come
into the grotto, And I feel that we have a good bunch.
Cavers have always been an individualistic bunch, and this
has actually been the binding force of cavers, As Paul
(Pablo) Davis put it in a previous Trog, the notable fact
of cavers is their ability to regard people for what they
are, instead of for what they think they should be,
Naturally, as a new group comes into the grotto, the members
have their own idiosyncrasies, but it cannot be denied that
the grotto has had major trips to at least four caves for
almost every weekend this year. So, I think the most im-
portant thing in caving is to put caving first, and to do
your own thing.

EDITOR'S COLUMN
The Virginia Polytechnic Institute Grotto of the NSS
is located in Blacksburg, Virginia. Recently we observed
our 28th anniversary as a grotto. This makes the VPI
grotto the second oldest active grctto in the National
Speleological Society. This year we are hosting the 30th
annual NSS Convention. We feel it will be worth your while
to pay us a visit:
First of all, Blacksburg is ideally located for
caving. There is even a cave within walking distance of
campus. Within an easy day's drive there are literally,
hundreds of miles of caves; enough to suit even the most
eager caver,
For the vertically oriented, there are caves such as
Clover Hollow with its drops of 70, 90' and 140' repectively
with numerous small climbs in between. For those who like
mud in their teeth there is the 180' drop of Spence Cave,
Or for an impressive drop that you can walk back up, there is
the 186" in Newberry"s Cave, maybe if you are lucky, you
can catch Higgenbotham's without water.
