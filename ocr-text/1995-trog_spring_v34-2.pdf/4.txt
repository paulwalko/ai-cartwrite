[The following material was sent to
the NSS News for publication in the June
1995 issue]
It's not too late! You can still decide
to attend the one-and-only 1995 NSS
Convention in Blacksburg, Virginia.
Unless you have been living in a cave or
something for the last several months,
you surely know about this major
speleological event occurring on July
17-21. The following are some last
minute tidbits and a brief overview of the
Convention to help persuade you to
attend. If you want to get more detailed
information, please consult your NSS
News issues from February through May.
Blacksburg and the surrounding
area are in the heart of Virginia's cave
country so a Convention attendee
interested in caving should have no
problem finding a fascinating and
challenging caving experience. If caving
isn't your thing, this year's sessions are
sure to be both educational and
entertaining. There are activities geared
for everyone in the family at this year's
Convention, and the Convention staff is
hard at work to make sure that things run
smoothly and your stay in Blacksburg is
as fun-filled as possible. And, if you
pre-register, you will spend less time
taking care of the boring business of
checking into the Convention and you
will get to those exciting activities
immediately after you arrive in
Blacksburg.
PRE-REGISTRATION DEADLINE:
Although the deadline for getting the
pre-registration discount is past, you can
still pre-register by mail and avoid most
of the waiting when you arrive. However,
act fast because your pre-registration
must be received by June 30. Any that
arrive after that will be returned to you
when you arrive at registration. Also,
please remember that credit cards will
not be accepted for on-site registration.
REFUND POLICY: If you find that
you cannot make it to the Convention,
call or write us for a refund. Anyone
whose refund request is postmarked
prior to July 17 will receive a full refund
after the Convention. If you just don't
show up we can't give you a refund, but
we will mail you your Guidebook and
program.
DIRECTIONS TO REGISTRATION:
Convention registration is easy to find.
The exact instructions are in the May
NSS News, but in case you can't find
them, take Business Route 460 into the
center of Blacksburg and turn on College
Ave. Registration is in the Donaldson
Brown Center that is on your right after
two blocks.
DAY PASSES: Day passes are
available for $25/day. The pass includes
the day's sessions, access to all the
vendors, and access to the evening's
non-dining activities. You can attend
Monday's Howdy Party for an additional
$5 if you have a day pass, or for $10 if
you don't have a Monday day pass. You

additional $10 if you have a day pass, or

banquet reservation by Tuesday, July 18,
You can pre-register for day passes or
purchase them at registration during the
