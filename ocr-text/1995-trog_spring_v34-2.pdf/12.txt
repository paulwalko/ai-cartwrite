NEW RIVER CAVE 4/1/95

• The first time Mike Mirro
mentioned this trip to me, we both
agreed that it was the type of trip that
actually required planning and
strategy. We also had an unspoken
understanding that only by a minor
miracle would that planning be
accomplished anytime sooner than
twenty-four hours before the trip. |
was more amused than surprised,
therefore, when I saw Bob Cosby
getting directions to the back of New
River Cave at the Friday night party
before the trip early the next morning.
As Lawrence Britt related the various
twists and turns and grim spots which
make you wish you were above
ground, Bob copied them down on
part of an empty sixer of Sam
Adams. He claimed he would
transfer them to another piece of
paper, but when we consulted the
directions in the cave they were still
on that same piece of cardboard. As
word of the trip spread around the
party, other cavers offered us
encouraging words such as, "Don't be
upset when you don't make it", or
simply laughed. I left the party early,
not wanting to miss out on my three
hours of sleep.
We brave seven met at the new
signout at 7AM the next morning.
Bob Cosby, Steve Lepera, John
McKenna, Mike Mirro, Steve Wells,
David “Digby” Empson, and myself all
milled around, filled up on carbide,
piled into the vehicles, and headed
out. We made the mandatory stop at
Wade's on the way out of town and
proceeded to the cave. Somewhere
around 10AM we headed into the
cave. We made it to the waterfall,
which I had not seen since my very
first cave trip, without incident. Now
we made our way into the section of
the cave that includes Tuxedo
Junction and other tight crawly things.
This is where my helmet began with
its familiar trick of letting my carbide
lamp pop out of its bracket at
inconvenient times (thank you to all..
who assisted with retrievals). I
should mention now that I had
borrowed my roommate's lamp for
this trip. My own lamp was patiently
awaiting rescue in Links Cave after
problems similar to those |
experienced on this trip. That,
however, is another story to be told at
another time.
The group pressed on, passing
The Devil and Miss Jones and other
landmarks on our journey to the back
of the cave. After two wrong turns
we arrived at a large room at the top
of which is Parrot's Roost. At this
point the group was divided as to
which way to go. While Steve Wells
scouted the other side of Parrot's -
Roost, I found myself looking down
the 50' drop from this cross-over. As
I leaned forward over the drop I felt
my roommate's carbide lamp shift in
its bracket once again and I watched
as it tumbled into the black space
below. It hit bottom with what I
assumed was a $40 bang and I
cursed my luck with as much
enthusiasm as I could muster. The
lamp was retrieved later with only a
cracked base to show for the fall, and
was still functional, although it
remained in my pack for the rest of
