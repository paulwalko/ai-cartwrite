VPI, Well, at least they didn't lie about the naked men! This is the
closest I'll get for a while unless I slip going up rope.
... Was too sorry about the gypsum flowers. NO NO

I'm sitting here, alone with three men and all they want to do is look at
pictures. Oh well I guess I'll go slide up and down the dragons tail while
I wait for them.
VPI 313. I came after Kristen and all I can say is that she took her
clothes off at the gypsum flowers but now she won't even untie her
shoes for us. I guess I'll go to the thistle tube and wait for them.

VPI 320, “I thought there were some tight crawls in here! I just can't
find anything!!

Been a long time - still the same.
Becoming less pure by the minute!
Thope when Ollie gets horny he farts less!!
Nice stock of goodies in here.
Allright, I'm here for the last time in a while. Maria now hates me and
“Jake” Isn't going to get any for 1 month to a year. She was none to
amused with the thistle tube, but just a little gullible as any trainee.
Chris first time down it too. he was much more impressed, but he
admitted he didn't know exactly what to look for, Clover still my favorite
cave.

First time here. Most excellent formations. Vertical climb is going to kill
me!
My first vertical. Going out will be hell but it should be an excellent
experience.
Life is life - My first vertical too - fun stuff - Gabba Gabba Hey.

VPI 305, Can't wait to show the flowers.
The great escape on parents weekend. The lone woman and belch
queen.

Dave, once again did the thistle tube backwards. Can you believe it, he took 1:15. Boy he's
slow.
Cool crew, let's do this trip again. Fine by me! Let's rock-n-roll.

Literature was educational. I didn't know they could do that!
How did she get so big?
Have to make a return trip.
Damn, I didn't know they could stretch like that!
Blonde's do have more fun.
