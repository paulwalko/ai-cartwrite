their vicious dogs, and heard more about
Potato Cave where their Grandmas or
old neighbors had stored their potatoes
to keep them from freezing, because of
course that was all the refrigeration they
had. And we heard about Earl Jones,
who owned all the land up and down the
creek.
Also, we heard tell, after much
questioning, that there has been some
Zirkels living on further up the valley.
After deciding that maybe in 1896,
Professor Mercer really hadn't known
how far five miles above the mouth of
Dumpling Creek on the French Broad
really was, we drove a few miles on. It
was pretty clear that this valley wasn't
the same as in 1869 nor in 1896 with all
the house trailers and boats and such,
but even back then Dumpling Creek
wouldn't have been easy to follow.
In following Gerald's topos, we
came to the homegrown T.R. Truck stop
where I had an emergency visit. We
decided to eat and hashed over the
historical account and topos the 50th
time. Then we headed across the road to
ask the people who lived there if they
knew about any caves. Of course they
did, but they sent us back to the Truck
stop because T.R. owned all the land.
We got lots of information, then a very
stern-faced elder announced, “There
aren't any caves around here and T.R.
wouldn't want you in 'em anyway." Well,
we could take a hint, and we headed
further up the valley.
Driving 'round about we ended up at
the Ponderosa, which, of course,
belonged to Earl Jones, where several
young people were fixing up an almost
unfixable old homestead. Hah, four
victims in one blow! We walked into their
freshly spackled kitchen and trapped
them. But they cleverly referred us on to
Earl Jones on the old Ashville Highway,
and we re-entered the Nissan. Up drove
the biggest, reddest Ford pick-up I had
ever seen, and we knew -- it had to be
Earl Jones. We jumped out of the Nissan
a lot faster than we entered and here
was our next very willing victim, who,
though he protested how much of a hurry
he was in, told us how much history of
the valley he knew -- how Dumpling
Creek had been named because this
was an area where the Indians of
yesteryear had hung out and one day
when some of THEM were crossing the
creek, they dumped their dumplings right
in. And then there was Potato Cave and
lots else, and he sent us on our way.
We winded our way up the valley,
keeping an eye out for the creek, and
into the yard of another old homestead
where we found several more-than-
willing victims (and the sucker who is
writing this was victimized). Oh, definitely
there was more than one cave on the
opposite hill, definitely a Potato Cave
where the old folks had kept their
potatoes because, of course, that was
the only refrigeration they had, over the
double log bridge that had double action
as one bounced across it. And so up the
steep slopes through the brambles with a
couple of 12 year-olds. “You know there
is water in that thing on your waist?"
“Can I work for you? You do interesting
things.” “Is that a Coon lamp?” “Will you
bring me out some of that purty
limestone?" "How do they make those
caves, anyway?" "I'll come right behind
you and catch you if you fall."
Forgetting to take off my Claus long-
sleeved shirt, I donned by helmet and
dived into the 18" high slot, kicking
leaves a lot because I am ever aware
that I do not want a cave named Sesile-
Sudden-Sink, and slid down towards the
drop-off. Peering over carefully, I
recognized the scenario -- a great funnel
