My First Caving Trip
by Allison Dineen
most of my memories of my first trip are
of how miserable I was. My lamp leaked
the entire time and I managed to catch
everyone on fire at least once. I swore
to myself that if I ever went caving again,
I would never use a carbide lamp.

I've always had an interest in caves
for as far back as I can remember.
Unfortunately, growing up in Western
New York, there wasn't a cave within a
hundred miles so I had to make do with
what we had. When I was younger,
about ten years old or so, I would drag
my little brother into every crawl space
and drainage ditch that I could find. We
would occasionally come across a rat or
a snake, but it only added to the
excitement of the trip.
The first time that I saw the inside
of a real cave was during the summer
after my freshman year in high school. |
was staying with my Aunt and Uncle in
Salt Lake City and they took me to
Timpanogos Cave National Monument
one day. We turned down the "wild"
cave tour for the more affordable
commercial tour. The cave actually
consisted of three small caves connected
by manmade tunnels and the entire tour
took a little under half an hour. The tour
guide seemed to know very little about
caves except for what he was taught to
say, and he couldn't answer any of our
questions. I was determined to go to a
cave someday where I could explore
wherever I wanted without having to stay
on a cement walkway.
When I first came to Virginia Tech, I
saw some fliers hanging up around
campus inviting everyone to "come out
and check out the Cave Club". I went to
my first meeting and hooked up on a trip
to Tawney's with Bob Cosby, Adam
Hungerford and Leroy Burch. We got
into the cave around 3:00 after a big
misunderstanding about the designated
meeting place and a short seminar on
carbide lamps in Jim's driveway. Sadly,
10
l quickly learned why boots are
recommended as I tried to climb a mud
bank while wearing a pair of white Keds.
By the time we got to the sinkhole, I was
completely soaked from continuously
sliding into the stream. We had a
tremendous battle in the Phallus Room
that left us all coated in mud and looking
like walking sculptures as we emerged.
Overall my first trip was exciting and
fun, but the most enjoyable part of the
trip was eating stale bread in the back of
Bob's van. I was amazed that something
so horrible could taste so good after five
hours underground.
