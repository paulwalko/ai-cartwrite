Huntin' for Zirkel's Cave (a most obscure cave) in No-ing Land
by Cecile James
In 1869, a Professor Cope, probably
from the University of Pittsburgh, began
a search for signs of Early Wo Man in
North American caves (since many
European caves revealed artifacts of
Early Wo Man, his hypothesis was that if
Early Wo Man had existed on the North
American continent, there would be relics
in the caves). He found many bones of
animals of that era, but was unable to
find any of Early Wo Man. However, he
did leave behind him records of his
search, and in his records were reports
of caves in the state of Tennessee.
In 1896, Professor Henry Mercer of
the University of Pittsburgh followed in
Professor Cope's footsteps and
rediscovered the caves he had visited.
Well, it may have been easy in 1896 to
find Zirkel's Cave, as Professor Mercer
described it, on the left bank of Dumpling
Creek about 5 miles above its mouth in
the French Broad River near Knoxville,
but in 1995 it is about as easy as
untangling a 1200 foot rope made up into
four coils which are then passed through
each other in order to stabilize them (Trip
to Cepilla, 1992).
On a recent sunny Saturday, Gerald
Moni and I set off in his Nissan truck
from the Walker Springs' Shoney's in
Knoxville for Dumpling Valley to find
Dumpling Creek to follow Professor
Cope's and Professor Mercer's trail.
Gerald had found all the other caves that
the two had shared in the 27 year span
in Tennessee, and this was the last one
on the list. Gerald was as usual well
armed with his area topos and TCS
notebooks and the historical report. As
we headed South from 1-40, I realized
with great trepidation that we were
30
headed towards DollyPartonLand, and
sighed with relief only after we turned
around in less than half a mile because
we had crossed over the used-to-be
ridge (cut away from the maze of
motels). We went back to Dumpling
Valley Road which is now home of the
Greatest Craft and Flea Market in
Tennessee and cut over the ridge where
it had not been destroyed and found our
first historical search victim readying
himself to spray weevils in his alfalfa,
overlooking Dumpling Creek. We
exchanged pleasantries about alfalfa and
he admitted as how even if he sprayed
his alfalfa real good, it still wouldn't be as
good as the lowa alfalfa I had helped my
father and brothers â€œput up". Then we
began discussing all the caves in the
area and Potato Cave (of which Gerald
had a record) and then he offered to
meet us in an hour over a couple of
ridges at a real cave that as far as he
knew wasn't mapped or discovered by
real cavers). But seeing as how we were
looking for Zirkel's Cave, we talked to his
partner across the field who said we
needed to talk to Earl Jones, who owned
all this land up and down the creek. He
also accused Gerald of being a lawyer
because when Moni is looking for caves,
he is relentless and the questions are hot
and heavy, hence the victim status of the
questioned.
Armed with the topos we took
another road in Dumpling Valley, sort of
following Dumpling Creek, drove past our
goal and back again and found ourselves
in front of a locked gate and overlooking
1-40. We had, of course, stopped a
couple of times on our way and quizzed
more historical search victims, talked to
