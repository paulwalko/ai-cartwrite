Grotto Grapevine
by A.l. Cartwright
.
This semester's Grapevine starts on
a somber note. Don Davison, a VPL
caver, went off to tackle all 22057 feet of
Mt. Llullaillaco on the border between
Chile and Argentina, hoping to complete
the first solo climb. He was due back in
March, but remains missing. Search
efforts continue, and folks in Blacksburg
are passing on information as quickly as
it comes.
Ed Richardson's mom, known to
many of the old farts, passed away in
April. She will be missed by all the
cavers she'd befriended over the years.
Let's move on to some typical caver
gossip. As usual, Banquet brought out
many long-unseen faces. The old folks
were surprised to see Chickenwing (Mark
Honosky) and his wife Margaret with a
little boy in tow.
Ray Sira was the proud recipient of
the Flame-out Award, although he
doesn't remember the party at which he
earned it. The P.W. Award went to Sarah
Ludeke. She was given a leash which
was placed around Bob Cosby's neck
and attached to her finger. Taking
advantage of the situation, she made him
propose before letting him out of the
collar. The wedding is planned for July
29, 1995.
On April 1st, Les Good and Berta
Kirchman snuck off to the courthouse
and made their cohabitation legal. So
which one is the fool?
David Shantz and Kim Hanson
celebrated their mutual birthday on
March 19th. Given both of their
fondness for beer and socializing,
perhaps they were twin siblings
separated at birth ....
The club elected new officers this
14
semester. Alison Williams is now
President, Carl Bern is Vice President,
Jen Savage is Secretary, and Steve
LePera is Treasurer. Best of luck to the
new Cabinet; may they manage to
interest more prospective members than
they scare off.
Speaking of new members, the club
gained a whopping two voting trainees
this semester. Allison Dineen was voted
in after several years of caving with the
club, and Nathan Sharp just snuck in
before the semester came to a close.
Glen Davis celebrated his birthday
on April 11th. He claims he turned 39
(or is that the 39th time he's turned 19?).
Craig Ferguson landed a job
working in Roanoke. He's amazed that
people would pay him to do the things he
did in his spare time for fun (which
means either the job is really cool or
Fergie's a total geek). Hard as they try,
though, they still haven't gotten him into
a tie.
Dave Colatosti finally managed to
graduate, and promptly ran off to work in
Maryland. Just as this occurred, Dave
Warren, living in Maryland, decided to
take a job in Alabama. Perhaps there's a
cap on the number of Daves that are
permitted to live in Maryland (obviously
Virginia hasn't yet adopted this rule).
Paul Kirchman is making future
plans. It all started with setting up a
weekend love-nest in Richmond with
Dabney Hammer. It seemed harmless
enough at the time, but the next thing he
knew, they were engaged! Rumor has it
she plans to sweep him off to some
exotic land, perhaps Kansas.
He's not the only crazy one with
marriage in mind. Cecile James and
