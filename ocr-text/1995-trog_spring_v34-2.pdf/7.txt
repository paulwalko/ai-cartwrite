One Memorable Excursion to Clover Hollow
by Mark Ruocco
February 26, 1995, was an
unusually warm and bright Saturday
for winter time in the New River
Valley. Naturally, ten VPI cavers
headed straight underground to
escape the scourge of sunlight and
good weather for the comfort of
darkness. Ray Sira brought along his
camera and his expertise at cave
photography, while a couple of
trainees hefted the tripod and some
rope for the drops that lay ahead.
Once in, Ray set up his equipment to
capture Susan Vermeulen's skillful
glide down into the entrance hole of
Clover Hollow. Nathan Sharp was
asked to rig the first short drop inside
the cave as a demonstration of his
newly acquired skills. Three members
drilled him on spotting the best rig
point and the worthiness of his knot.
Here, several trainees took the lead
and did their first arm rappel, each
skeptical that it really could be done
until they each tried it and succeeded.
Once at the bottom, Carl Bern took to
rigging the next drop over the
waterfall as the remaining veterans.
filed down behind.
: Beyond lay the Canyon, which
was rigged in two places by Ray and
Carl with Mark and Nathan looking on
with nervous interest. After what
seemed an eternity, the group made
it safely to the bottom and took a
well-deserved break. Anxious to see
the sights, the troop set off to
conquer Dragon's Tail which turned
out to be quite a challenge for
trainees and members alike - mostly
due to bats hanging in the most
inconvenient places!
After sliding down the Dragon's
Tail, Susan, Greg Frohn, Carl, Bill
Brown, Nathan, and I sat down and
scarfed up some lunch to refuel tired
muscles. Carl's dark chocolate M&M
candies seemed to be the most
coveted items of the trip. Damn, they
were tasty little things! Ray and the
others wandered of to scout some
more photo locations and set up
down toward the library. Meanwhile
Carl and Greg introduced trainees to
the wonders of the thistle tube. Being
cautious and tired at this point, I went
feet first and was left wondering how
to get back out. Carl came to the
rescue, only to drop his lamp down
the tube with me still wedged halfway
inside it. This was a welcome turn of
events since it diverted my attention
in a hurry from my worries of being
stuck! No harm done. Nathan and
Jason braved going in head first and
did considerably better.
The last adventure was to the
library before beginning the five-hour
trek back to the entrance (for all you
speed climbers - it was a photo trip,
okay!?). Susan, Corwin, Nathan, and
| perused the wealth of “reading
material “ just waiting to be admired.
I found a particularly amusing issue of
High Society dating back to the
1970s. Being all a little weary, the
crew of “researchers" gazed in delight
at the feature article “Circus of Lust"
which had seriously deranged-looking
models engaged in some majorly
weird circus poses. This quickly
became the joke of the trip and later
made it to comments at signout.
