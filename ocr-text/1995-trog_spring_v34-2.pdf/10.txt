Caves always look better in the light.
It is good to have gas during caving.
You can easily leave a cave.
There are maps to caves.
Caves don't mind if you stop when you are tired.
8. You can get shots for what you catch in a cave.
9. It is understandable if you go down the wrong tunnel while caving.

11. When caving, the more friends you have with you the more fun it is.
