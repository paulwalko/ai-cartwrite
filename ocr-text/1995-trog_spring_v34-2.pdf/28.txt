SMOKE HOLE 4/9/95
by Nathan Sharp
It is really something unexplainable,
Asking, "What is it like
underground?" is like a blind person
asking what the color blue looks like. It's
just something you have to experience to
fully understand, and I think that you
need to do it more than once.
My first trip was a long, involved,
crazy trip with lots of people - hence
slow moving. Even after all 9 hours of
being underground I still didn't appreciate
the subtlety of the experience. While !
was sure that I enjoyed the occasion,
something hadn't clicked, and I noticed
the disparity between how I thought I
should feel about the trip and how I did
feel about it.
About a year and a half later I was
sitting in the shade of Smythe at noon on
a gorgeous Sunday afternoon joking,
"Man, we gotta get out of this ugly sun
and find a nice dark, cold, muddy hole."
It always seems counter productive to
evade a warm spring sunny day by
exploring the underneath of a mountain,
but to me the underground is just as
peaceful as above.
This was one of those days where
there are lots of cavers going out, about
10 or 15 - many of whom are first timers,
so there is mass confusion and general
slowness. I have learned to just relax on
days like these and enjoy the last few
moments in the light while we get
everything together.
It is not until two hours later, after
splitting up into two smaller trips and
racing over the mountains of 460 stuffed
in a little old stick shift, that we dress in
our warm clothing and smell the scent of
acetylene.
We were headed into Smoke Hole
with hopes of going the Water Exit way
out. Since it was hot, Mike Mirro and
Andy Sabalowsky decided to go in the
Water Exit. Allison Dineen, Matt Barnett,
and I decided against it and hiked up the
hill to the normal entrance.
Just inside the cave, almost in the
way of a crucial butt hold, was an orange
with black polka dots newt which we
stopped to watch for a few seconds.
Caves are so relatively devoid of life that
anything seen usually becomes a
spectacle.
Allison had slid down the first hole
and I was in the middle of it when Mike
and Andy showed up behind us. It turns
out the water was high and there was
not enough air in the Water Exit to get
through. Even more unfortunate was
that they got soaked, head to toe, in
order to discover that.
We were thus entered into this other
world, one I can't really explain except
on the surface. I can tell about things
like the little mass of white mold
encompassing some unlucky bug just
inside the cave attached to the chert on
the ceiling above a small, cold,
underground creek. It was just past the
first room where some formations had
been, shiny wet but brown as everything
else. Our legs stung with the cold of the
water. By simply descending a few feet
we had left the normal world for a 3-D
world that could be in Giles County, or it
could be on the moon; you really can't
tell down there.
You do a lot of 'duck walking' in
Smoke Hole through the stream, which
takes a lot of energy. One of the
differences between my first caving trip
and caving now is physical ability. I've
