COMMERCIAL CAVE DISCOUNTS:
Several of the commercial caves along
1-81 and 1-64 (on the way to the
Convention) are expected to offer
discounts to Convention attendees.
When you visit one of these caves, just
ask whether they are giving NSS -
members or Convention attendees a
discount. You may be asked to show
your NSS card.
CHILD CARE: We are still
investigating ways of providing child care
during the Convention. At a minimum
we hope to provide a baby-sitting service
during the Photo Salon and the banquet.
Additional information will be available at
the registration desk.
CAMPGROUND: The campground
is a large, open athletic field. It has
good drainage (for the inevitable
Convention downpour), but there is
almost no shade. We suggest bringing a
tarp or other man-made shade. We
expect to have bags of ice on sale at the
campground throughout the week.
HANDICAP ACCESS: Most
Convention facilities are handicap
accessible. However, if you need any
special consideration, please let us know
ahead of time so we can insure that your
needs are accommodated.
AUCTION & NSS MUSEUM ITEMS:
Do you have lots of speleo-stuff
cluttering up your house? Are you
wondering what to do with those old
items you used many years ago in your
early caving days? Well, why not bring
them to the Convention and donate them
to the auction or to the NSS museum?
Items donated to the auction are sold to
raise funds for ongoing NSS expenses.
If you have publications, memorabilia or
equipment that is historically significant,
this is a great time to cart it to the
Convention and donate it to the NSS
Museum. There will be a selection of
museum material on display during the
Convention.
SPECIAL RUSS GURNEE
PRESENTATION: There will be a
special presentation entitled "The
Expeditions and Explorations of Russ
Gurnee" on Monday at 2 PM. This will
be a slide program describing the late
Russ Gurnee's long and illustrious career
as a speleologist and conservationist,
both in the U.S. and throughout the
world.
NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM
RECEPTION: The Cave Conservancy of
the Virginias' large exhibit on caves and
cave science will be on display at the
Blacksburg Natural History Museum
throughout the Convention week. On
Tuesday evening at 6 PM there will be a
reception at the Museum to give the
townspeople an opportunity to view the
exhibit and to meet some "real" cavers.
Everyone is invited to attend the
reception.
VENDORS: Indoor vendors,
including the NSS Bookstore and
consignment sales, will be located.
adjacent to the primary Convention
auditorium in the Donaldson Brown
Center. The outdoor vendors will be
located immediately adjacent to the
campground.
In addition to the on-campus
vendors, Blacksburg and the surrounding
area include many stores that can
probably satisfy any shopping need.
This is a prosperous and growing region.
ATM machines and other "big city"
conveniences are readily available.
EMERGENCY TELEPHONE
NUMBER: The Convention registration
desk will have a telephone, and the
registration staff will take emergency
messages and post them on the bulletin
board. However, the telephone number
will not be known until registration is set
