returned to make the dreaded ascent
of the Canyon.
I snuck in on the trip not having
learned my prussiking technique
beforehand, so Carl accompanied me
on tandem ropes on this first attempt
at ascending. We stopped,
suspended a third of the way up, and
turned off our lamps so Ray could
work his photo magic. Twenty some
minutes later (a credit to everyone's
patience with the unprepared trainee
(self-admitted)), we both crested at
the top. The trip back to the entrance
was a slow process and it was close
to midnight by the time the last rope
was hauled up and a few warm beers
were downed by a bunch of weary
cave people. This was one trip to
Clover Hollow not soon forgotten!
excerpt from The Caver Dictionary:
c√¢rl, V., to drop your light, especially down a pit, ie. "This would be a bad time
to carl; the pit is 70 feet deep!"
