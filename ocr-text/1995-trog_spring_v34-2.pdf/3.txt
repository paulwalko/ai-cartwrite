Editor's Note
Many thanks to everyone who helped me pull off Picnic this year. Nathan Sharp was a
first rate Hot Dog Guy and collected money so well that he ought to go into politics
(but please don't!). Thanks to those who brought beer out (all six kegs) and to those
who carried kegs home.
That's all. See, I didn't even beg and plead for submissions!
