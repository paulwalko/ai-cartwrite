Clover Hollow Cave
Library Register Excerpts
1984 -1994
9/29/84
This register was donated by Michael King and Carl Shytle on Sept. 29, 1984
We figured it was about time to start a new one. Carl got so interested in getting to the library
that we declared the hell with Andrews drop.
This porn gets better as the years go by the wine. (especially like “young pussies").
Did some serious caving as usual. This will probably be my last trip caving for awhile (mike's)
because I'm getting married in November. Damn I've been engaged since January. Thats
fucking eternity. Will be back probably in march. So until then keep the mud off your balls.

We made it, but no librarian was in, so we couldn't check anything out.
(Paul) Thistle Tube in 3 minutes. (Craig) Thistle Tube in 2.5 minutes.
Some really fine gypsum flowers in there - just gotta see um to believe it! Philip's reading “A
new look Beastiality". Says it's real good. I (Paul) should make member any time. Got knots &
requirments & after this trip, 60+ hours. Love those comments in Penthouse about “Dusty".
Time to go. Ciao! V.P.I. & S.U. Grotto.

TSK TSK TSK. What a shameful cave club library! Not a single copy of
Forum. What's a library without good disgusting reading? Pictures
alone, short articles, no depth, no depth at all and we all know how
important that is!
Such Amatures... All this pornography... Look folks what you gotta do is
just bring somebody with you. Why occupy just one sense when you
can please all 5. Great sport cave.

Well, WE rearranged the library a bit today - Lets try to keep it in order. If you see something
that is rotten and worthless, leave it, but if you can't tell what it was anymore, please take it
out with you. We welcome any additions that are in keeping with tradition here.
Serubifals,

Hey guys, the gypsum flowers must not be in bloom this time of the year.
