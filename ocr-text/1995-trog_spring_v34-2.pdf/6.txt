up. When registration is not open,
emergency messages should go through
the Virginia Tech Campus Police at
(703)231-6183. Needless to say, this
number should only be used for true
emergencies.
HAM RADIO FREQUENCY: 147.48
Mhz seems to have become the de-facto
standard simplex frequency used by
"ham-cavers". There is no official
Convention "talk-in" frequency, but you
can probably find some cavers
monitoring this frequency.
Don't miss out on the 1995 NSS
Convention in Blacksburg.
Remember ...
Virginia is for Cavers!
