I was lying in bed pondering the
feeling one gets after sleeping twelve
hours and waking simply by opening
your eyes at no particular time. I was
noting to myself that it was much
better than being jarred out of a
restful slumber by an obnoxious
alarm, when I heard the rapid
beeping of a distant cordless phone
ringing. Thad developed the habit of
turning off my bedroom phone
because of the hours my employer
forced me to work, and, indirectly,
sleep.
My initial reaction to this distant
but annoying interruption of the
morning silence was to roll over and
ignore it, chasing my thoughts back
into the smoky realms of dream. But
a thought occurred to me. Since my
long awaited graduation had come
and gone, many of my resumes were
now finding their way into some desk
jockey's hands. I considered this and
then it dawned on me that it was
Friday and, at this time, the normal
people of the world were up and
about, tending to their own wants and
whims, or rather to those of their
employers. And with what seemed
like a millennium of time while wiping
the haze of sleep away from the
recesses of my rested mind, I
answered the phone, making an
attempt not to sound like I was just
torn away from sleep. The ruse
worked.

early morning mental condition was
no longer necessary and so I quickly
lapsed back into that slurred and

waking mind. It is amazing what
liberties we take with our friends,
simply because they are our friends.
He informed me that a newborn
calf had managed to find its way into
the dark twisted recesses of a small
cave. I made a quick assessment of
my state of mind and upon deciding
that I had slept enough to make up
for the thirty eight hour sojourn with.
out sleep, I agreed to participate. I
informed Ray that I would get out to
the farm as soon as I grabbed a
quick bit of food and organized my
necessary, implying clean, gear.
As I was sitting at the table
enjoying my small bowl of frosted
wheat puffs, an adequate and far less
expensive alternative to Super
Golden Crisps, reconstituted
powdered skim milk, a serviceable
and longer lasting alternative to whole
milk; and a glass of Drink-Aid
Orange Drink Mix, also reconstituted
and much cheaper, in both price and
taste, than real orange juice, the
phone rang. As I choked down the
last few drops of the thin milky white
liquid masquerading as milk, Glen,
who was on the phone, informed me
of young calf that had found its way
into a cave. I briefly wondered if
there might be a market for a rescue
group specializing in retrieving farm
animals who seemed to think they
were bats. But my early morning
brain was beginning to spark to life
and I quickly realized that Glenn's
calf and Ray's calf were one and the
same. I thought, "So much for the
