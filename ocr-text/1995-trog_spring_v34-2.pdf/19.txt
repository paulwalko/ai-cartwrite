fitting some kind of harness to the
calf while Ray rigged up the ropes
and necessary equipment for safely
hauling the calf out. I put this
question to you, the reader, because
Bill and I asked ourselves this
question several times as we began
working on our task at hand: How do
you rig a harness to a creature about
the size of a large Saint Bernard
dog? We initially decided on using
the components of Bill's sewn
harness. But we still remained
puzzled as to how to proceed with
this adventure in creative rigging.
Bill and I were concerned that
we might hurt the creature by our lack
of knowledge in the area of "cows
and harnesses that work well for
them". After a few fruitless, and what
appeared might be painful solutions,
we sought some suggestions from
Don and Ray. After some discussion
and advice, we ended up tying a
Swiss seat around the hind legs of
the calf and using Bill's sewn harness
around the front legs. Bill's waist belt
on his harness served as a safety
backup around the animal's
abdominal region. We then linked the
components together.
At this point we were still unsure
of the gender of our patient.' This
information was not known since it
had gone caving before anyone had
seen it, and we had not made any
effort to determine this. Apparently
aware of our ignorance, our patient
decided to inform us by relieving
himself, and just to make matters
complete, perhaps sensing what we
were about to do to him, he had
opportunely positioned himself on top
of my rope. After what looked like
gallons of urine had passed out of our
uninjured and obviously functioning
four legged caver, we made some
final adjustments to the rigging and
harnesses and attached him to the
rope.
I positioned myself on a ledge
about three fourths of the way out of
the twenty five foot pit. Ray was in
the narrow canyon above the pinch,
and Don prepared to haul on the rope
from beyond the pinch. Bill remained
at the bottom with the young bovine
to help him begin his ascent.
Sensing the upcoming situation,
our friend tried to get away, but to no
avail. Don and Ray had begun to - -
haul and the calf was effortlessly
moving up the pit. He gave one final
"moo" of desperation in his inability to
change the situation and then went
completely limp and ceased
struggling. Thelped guide the bull
away from the walls as he hovered
above Bill, who expressed his relief
that the young fellow had already
taken care of his "business".
The bull was pulled up to the
pulley and deposited in the narrow
canyon with Ray. In its limp state,
which one could not call
uncooperative but could certainly not
call cooperative, we often had to lift
its head up over ledges and around
rocks, since all he would do is hang
there. Once we accidentally banged
his head pretty hard against a ledge,
but this didn't seem to phase our
young friend. He didn't even blink an
eye or make a sound, except for the
thud of its thick skull against
unyielding rock. This kind of reaction
tends to lend credence to the belief
that cows are not very bright
creatures.
Once he was in the canyon, I
repositioned myself just below the
pinch at the end of the short canyon.
