The Rest of the Story
(Following the Flowstone )
by Raymond Sira
Having left the calf safe in its
mother's bosom Dave, Bill, and
myself headed back into the cave to
retrieve the gear and have a quick
look around (scoop booty). At the
bottom of the drop where we had
found the calf, the only lead was a
small hole 1 foot wide by 2 feet high
that sloped downward for about 5 feet
before opening up again. We pushed
through to find ourselves in a room
about 20 feet long by 6 feet wide and
8 feet high. The room was dry with a
dry dirt floor, hundreds of crickets on
the walls, and appeared to be virgin.
It continued over a breakdown block
and under some mud bridges to :
where it opened up again for another
30 feet. At this point the passage
makes a turn to the left and as we
peered around the corner we were
greeted by two 4 foot high broom
stick stalagmites with hundreds of
soda straws in a small alcove behind
them.
After few minutes of patting each
other on the back and gazing in awe
at the sight before us we continued
on. Directly underneath the two
stalagmites a narrow hole dropped
down through some flowstone-
covered breakdown. It dropped 10
feet straight down but was found to
be easily climbable. We climbed
down to find ourselves standing in a
room where I was afraid to move for
fear of soiling forever the beauty of
the pristine formations which lie
before me. Surrounding us on all
sides were formations of all kinds.
The near wall was covered with small
delicate white helectites that curled
out from it in all directions. The entire
floor was covered with a cascade of
flowstone, rimstone dams, and
stalagmites; in front of us almost
cutting the room in half was a line of
stalagmites, stalactites, and two
columns more than 10 feet high.
As we carefully chose our path
through this wondrous place we
passed a crystal clear pool of water
on the left that descended a series of
tiny rimstone dams and then at the
far end of the room, standing like the
monolith from 2001, for the first time
ever a giant column was touched by
light, having quietly stood guard over
this dark place for millennia. I stood
there and as I admired the beauty all
around me I thought to myself, â€œThis
is why I'm a caver."
We had seen enough for this trip
and as we turned and headed out of
the cave there was much discussion
over what we should tell the others
outside. In the end we decided this
would not be a secret cave;
something as beautiful as this needs
to be seen and admired in person
and with a little cooperation it can be.
A few weeks later, on a bitter
cold February morning, I again found
myself standing at the cave's
entrance. It was time to survey this
cave and see what else was waiting
to be discovered. Dave C. was doing
sketch, Bill Steier was lead tape, and
I was reading instruments. We
reached the point where we had
turned around on the last trip in 14
shots, and as Dave tried to catch up
with his sketching I took a look
around.
