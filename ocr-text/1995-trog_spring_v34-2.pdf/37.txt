All I know is that when I got to the gypsum flowers room, I saw Arnold
(Arnold Schwarzanager) and he told me "It's not a tumor".
I'm way to sexy for the gypsum flowers.

Best heat rescesive flowers I ever saw. Recede into wall when warm,
hmm??
I should be studying... Instead I'm studying “Cumming with my Collie
and various other assorted livestock”. Not to be outdone by pictures of
women with breast the size of important geological formations. Oh
heck! who needs to graduate anyway?
VPI, Much better than last time, no one has sprained their ankle yet.
