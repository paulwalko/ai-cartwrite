Bill stood at the lip of the pit at the
other end of the canyon, and Ray
squeezed through to the other side of
the pinch. Don had retreated with the
rope to outside of the cave and
began hauling. Bill navigated the calf
as he slowly rose up toward the
constriction. I was working at getting
the calf's head out of a corner when I
had the unfortunate luck of him
stopping his ascent toward the pinch
right at my eye level less than an inch
from my face. His breath was heavy
on my face and the odor was so
horribly distasteful that a case of
Certs wouldn't have helped make its
breath any less hideous. His large
brown eyes stared blankly into mine
and I hoped with all my might that he
would not suddenly stick his tongue
out and lick my face.â€œ Little did |
know, prior to brushing up on my Far
Side reading, that the young bull was
also secretly hoping that I would not
do the same to him. Stuck in this
terrible predicament, I urged the
others to continue hauling on the
rope. After Bill and I exchanged our
positions, we gave the calf a final
push through the pinch.
After the calf arrived in the
twilight region, Ray exited the cave to
prepare to photograph the
momentous occasion of the young
bovine's new found freedom. Bill and
I had managed to lift the calf up the
last four foot drop into the small
entrance room. When the young calf
saw the light of day, he began to stir
and struggle. Bill and I made a quick
move to calm the excited fellow, so
as to make it easier for us to push
him out the small entrance. With a
final heave on the rope by J.C. and
Mr. William's son, the young bull slid
out of the entrance into the
comparatively bright gray of a cold
January day. His eyes immediately
brightened knowing he was freed
from his black dungeon,
Bill humorously noted that the
lucky guy had spent half of his life in
a cave, and it was indeed true. The
owner, amazed and relieved at the
freeing of the uninjured animal,
reached between the bull's hind legs
and I half expected him to tell the calf
to turn its head and cough, but he
said to us, "This one's a keeper. Any
guy that can survive that has got a
set of balls. I am gonna call him
Caveman and we're not gonna snip
him."
If young Caveman had known
what his underground adventure had
actually earned for him, I think he
wouldn't have minded it a bit. I think
Caveman will have a long, healthy,
and fruitful life and definitely stay far
clear from caves, especially the one
name in his honor, Tough Calf Cave.
Hopefully his offspring will develop a
similar distaste for caves and prevent
the rise of NCRC. It would probably
be a horribly political group with lots
of bull being said, and not many
being rescued. As for us, the real
cave men, we ventured back into the
recesses of the earth to gather up the
gear left behind and see where this
apparently virgin cave went.
And go it did; but that is another
story ....
