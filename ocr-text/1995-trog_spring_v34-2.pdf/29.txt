gotten used to the awkward positions
and the crawling, thus I'm more
comfortable in the cave and I can enjoy
the experience more.
Mike and Andy were getting cold so
they decided to run ahead to the Big
Room. They told us, "Go up the
breakdown pile and when you come to
an intersection go left." We headed up
the breakdown, which is the last place
we saw Mike and Andy for a while. At
the top of the breakdown was a junction
so we went left. Allison didn't think it
was right but we explored it anyway. We
found one dead end that had some
pretty crystals and some deep mud, 1
explored off another lead and ended up
going in a big circle and coming in
behind them.
We weren't really sure what to do.
We didn't want to just go off exploring
too much because Mike and Andy would
probably come back wondering where
we were, but we didn't really want to just
sit there, either. We tried the
passageway off to the right. This time
Matt explored off ahead and found a
dead end after down climbing a while.
When we came back I found another
lead in a strange direction, but Matt and
Allison were just going to wait. I decided
to explore the lead for a short distance
and come right back. I found a short but
wide passageway with the stream
meandering around in it. In the distance
that I was willing to go without my
partners it didn't open up into anything.
Shortly after I returned we heard
Matt and Andy returning, coming from
the passageway I had found. It turns out
"left at the split" was actually much past
the breakdown pile and Mike had
forgotten that the entrance from the
breakdown was difficult to find.
Standing around talking to us had
left Mike and Andy cold again, so we got
28
better directions and they headed out. |
am reminded of why the caving club
exists as it does, and why we follow all
these silly rules. If anything were to
have gone wrong Mike and Andy could
have ended up standing still for quite
some time, and they could easily have
become hypothermic. A carbide lamp, a
trash bag, and some cave food could be
a lifesaver.
Off we went duck walking through
the creek. The ceiling became flat
except for long rows of small stalactites
that join at cracks in the ceiling in big
upside-down cities of stalactites. When
the ceiling sloped up small pieces of
bacon reached down. There was a
couple more duckunders of chert before
we reached the rimstone pools. Matt
and I searched all around and he took
pictures - which he was periodically
doing the whole trip. There was some
slippery going in the mud after that, and
Matt found a hole to explore which
ended up going over the passage we
were in and back down on the other
side. The Big Room was pretty dull
compared to the trip there, but it was a
good spot to stop and feed ourselves
and our lamps.
We had a small experience that
emphasizes the importance of being
prepared yourselves. The only tip
cleaners that had come in on the trip
were with Mike and Andy. Both Allison's
and my lamp needed it. Mine fortunately
just needed a little blow in the water lid
to fix it, but Allison ended up using our
light and her electric flashlight to get out
because her lamp would not burn right.
The trip back was less eventful.
Allison continued to tell us stories like
she had been doing most of the trip. I
lead the way and we stopped a few
times for Matt to take pictures.
We got good and confused right
