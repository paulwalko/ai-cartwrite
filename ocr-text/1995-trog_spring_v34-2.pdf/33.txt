for water but I could hardly put a knee in
it. We scoured the rest of the sinkholes
on the slope and came down again to
experience the unforgettable bouncing
logs.
Back into the Nissan and down the
road to our next victim who was bush-
hogging and delighted to quit and talk
history. He assured us he'd been in
every cave around as a kid and had had
to go to T.R.'s land back at the truck
stop to find them. Of course, he'd been
in Potato Cave. But his Daddy would
know more 'cause he had been
caretaker of a lot of Earl Jones' land
before it became Earl Jones' land. But
we were welcome to go and look at the
century old mill he owned down the road.
And we did.
