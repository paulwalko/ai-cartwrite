Sue was set on fire, but Joan just had hot flashes. We tried to arrange the porn with priority
porn on top. Kay the new librarian really knew her way around, said that Craig just didn't
measure up! We've all seen better porn before. Get some real porn!

It took four tries to find a mag that I hadn't seen or didn't want to see. NOTE: Cans should be
properly marked by preference. Vi Ritchie is a whore.

Love that thistle tube. Interesting library, we will have to resupply it soon. All and all an
interesting trip. P.S. Please excuse the sticky pages.

Miles Drake
Berta Kirchman Kevin Breneman
Miles got through Cigar Room squeeze. Doesn't recommend a repeat. Gets too small even
for him - and the squeeze is a one way hole - we almost left him there - By the way I think
we're going to have to leave Kevin here. Quote Roberta to Miles - "Would you like me to take
all my clothes off and follow you in there". -There was no reply as Miles went into shock
temporarily-.

VPI Cave Club, Virginia Tech's Hard Corps
Mark Eisebies VPI 313, We did some naked Yoga - We saw some flat things with
lines on them (Gypsum Flowers).
Regina Madaline "If I only had a brain" Love them gypsum flowers.
Brian Bachmann Again and I did see the lovely flat things with lines on them. I yam a
chicken.
Scott "Hoss". Leiffer Not fooled by the flowers. “Bigger is better” “Smaller sucks" (not very
well either) not the size of the ship, but the motion of the ocean. (This
man has no Finesse).
Brian Cruikshank They don't seem interested in the library. New people saw the flowers.
