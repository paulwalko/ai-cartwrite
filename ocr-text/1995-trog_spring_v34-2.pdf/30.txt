near the entrance. The exit we needed
was behind a rock and we didn't see it.
We knew we were in the right place
because Matt had noticed the moldy bug
that I had noticed on the way in. For a
few moments we were very confused.
Back at the Bat Ranch I thought
about all the reasons that I cave. The
biggest one is that thing that I tried to
talk about at the beginning of this story,
the one I can't explain. It certainly isn't
the only one though. I enjoy the physical
exercise, especially since it is a different
type of motion than most anything else.
It can be hard on your knees and hands,
but that is ok.
There is so much to learn by and.
about caving. The older cavers have a
lot to teach me and at this point I have a
lot to teach newbies. It feels good to be.
part of this.
The other cavers and members are
one of the best reasons. They are all
good people. We are all different,
maybe compatible, maybe not, but we i
are all in this hole together, and we all :
help each other out.
