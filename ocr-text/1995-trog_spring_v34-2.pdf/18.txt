Rescue Committee." Glen instructed
me to meet Bill Steier and Don
Anderson at his house. From Glen's
house we would travel straight to the
scene of the incident.
We three arrived at the Williams'
farm around 11 a.m. and were
directed to the cave by Jim
Washington. As we reached the
area, Ray was heading towards the
cave with his cave suit on and cave
gear in hand. We quickly followed
him to the hole in question and
arrived just in time to see him
disappear into the warm darkness of
a cave whose entrance seemed like
it would be very difficult for anything
to fall into. According to J.C. Links,
they had discovered the mother cow
standing by the entrance the night
before. They could tell she was
distressed by her loud and constant
mooing. They soon realized by the
presence of the nearby afterbirth the
fact that this was one of the pregnant
cows that was no longer pregnant,
and by her persistence in staying by
this cave, her offspring must currently
be residing in this small hole in the
ground. After a night of restless
broken sleep worrying about the
young calf that was sure to perish,
they gave Virginia Tech's Geology
Department a call. The department,
apparently unaware that Carol
Zokaites, a veteran of the cave club,
worked in their geology library,
instructed the Williams' to contact
Ernst Kastening at Radford
University. Being too busy with
teaching his classes, he in turn
passed it on to Don Anderson, a
fellow caver in the NRVG, to handle.
After Don had contacted a number of
people in the NRVG who couldn't
miss work or change their affairs, he
gave Glen Davis a call, figuring that
the VPI Cave Club would have the
people and desire to change plans
and act on the incident. Meanwhile
J.C. Links had driven by the farm and
essentially accomplished the same
thing in a minimum of time.
By the time the particulars of the
story had been told, Ray called out
from the dark nothingness indicating
that he had located the young calf.
After traveling approximately thirty
feet into the cave and down two small
drops and one not so small drop, the
young animal was alive, and to the ...

surprise and great relief of us all,
uninjured! Bill, Don, and I returned to
the vehicles to put our gear on and
obtain some ropes, slings, and
pulleys to aid in extricating this young
fellow. Back at the cave, Ray
informed us that the three drops were
easily climbed, and so Bill and I
joined Ray in delving into the place
where calves dare to dwell. Don
remained at the entrance to support
our efforts from there.
in the cave, the three of us
assessed the drops and how we
might rig it to get our four legged
friend out. He was situated at the
bottom of a narrow twenty five foot
pit. About six feet above the lip uf
the pit down a thin canyon was a
small pinch which appeared to be
smaller than our patient. We figured
that we would rig up some kind of
harness around our friend the calf
and rig a pulley with a safety around
a conveniently placed stalagmite
located on the wall just above the pit.
Don would haul from the entrance
side of the pinch and we three would
direct and assist our load as
necessary.
Bill and I took to the task of
