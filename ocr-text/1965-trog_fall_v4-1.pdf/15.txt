Thus fortified, we proceeded on to the Old Mill Building outside of Franklin.
Many had already arrived for a get-together which did not abate until late Monday
morning.
The National Capital Grotto and the PSC seemed well-represented, but when it
came to the group with the most." cavers!!, I'm sure VPI led the field by far. Alan'
Armstrong, John Peduzzi, Dick Gerling, Gene Harrison, Craig Peters, Gary McCutchen,
Barry Whittemore, R.E. Whittemore, Anne Braithwaite, Rick Nolting, Paul Helbërt,
Tim Schoechle, Henry Stearns, Bob Swensson, Bob Robins, Charlie Maus, and myself
all managed to put in an appearance or two over the holiday.
Saturday dawned foggy for some and clear for others, depending on how they
had spent the previous evening. Many stayed around the area and participated in the
Cave Olympics - ladder and prusik climb, cave crawl, best cave pack, obstacle course,
cave rescue and cave-mapping. Others spent Saturday and Sunday caving in Propst,
Sites, Sinnet, Trout, New Trout, Kenny Simmons, and Hamilton, in riding and climb-
ing on Seneca Rocks, or swimming.
The one group who entered the cave rescue contest did so poorly (three
hours and still not finished) that the MET Grotto decided to do something about the
situation. They were nice enough to arrange for two of their group to get into
trouble in Hellhole - and before you could yell NCG; a real live” rescue was under"
way. The funny part of the whole incident was that, now get this, John Cooper was
the only one at the party sober enough to lead the rescue. What a shameful way to
carry on, Coop. ;
Saturday night was party night again (ed. note: a branewpardy). For me, the
highlight of the night was when Bill Karras arrived with a truck full of 12 year :
olds. What happened to your high school boys, Bill?
· If it hadn't been for those friendly fellows from Australia with their bag-
pipes, I'm sure many would have slept through Sunday (ed. note: and Monday too),
Most people seemed to stick close to the area that day, swimming and partying, in
anticipation of the banquet that night,
It's at the banquet, a good meal of chicken with all the trimmings, that all
the prizes and praises are bestowed. Jerry Nettles certainly deserves a lot of
credit for coordinating the entire weekend.
Emmett Graham, a real old timer, unfortunately couldn't make it to the front
to receive his prize of a West Virginia-sizë shot-glass. He seemed to be trapped
at his table by a circle of bottles, glasses, and mixers.
• Dan Luke (caver för ten or so years), the person to most recently join the
NSS, received a huge ball of twine as his prize. I noticed that soon after Dan Had
left a trail of the twine dowił to the bar and back.
This year, the prizo for the distance furthest travellod went to Charlie "the
Squirell Lewis. Charlie only came from Arkansas, but he had such a hard time of it,
arriving with only a hard hat and cave pack, that he was awarded a B, C, wheel with
an axle of "green" to help him get home.
