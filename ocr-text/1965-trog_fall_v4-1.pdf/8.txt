MORE ON RAPPELING
The ideas and criticisms of rappeling techniquie so recently expressed in the
Troglodyte do not necessarily reflect the unanimous opinion of cle entire club.
By saying this Ilve already enlargened an argument, but at the same time I might
be able to offer a resolution.
I suggest that tha single brake bar rappel isn't always safe, and it certain-
ly isn't always hest. Now that I've dared to say this, I'd better back it up with
a few ideas and some simple-minded reasoning. (The reasoning must be kept simple
so as not to confuse our friends in Baltimore and Charlottesville),
For those who haven't yet discovered it: rappels are made under many differ-
ent conditions. There are several very important things that should at least be
considered in choosing a safe method of descent in any given situation. Most im-
portant: the nature of the drop. Will the rope be wet from the waterfall? How
long is the rappel? Will the rope be muddy? What type of rope? Nylon? Manilla?
What diameter? What about the person rappeling? Has he had any experience using
that particular method in similar circumstances?
Obviously, no single rappeling device is best for all combinations of circum-
stances. The problem involves friction. How much friction does the rappeling de-
vice produce and how much friction is the person rappeling capable of excercising
when using that device in a particular situation?
This is a rather inappropriate place to introduce a' trip report, but I would
like to use this particular incident to illustrate what I'm saying:
Last March, Paul Helbert, Paul's sister Dianne, Tom Vigour, John Tichenor,
Rocky Ward, Paul Schulz and I planned a photography trip to Cass Cave. It was a
cold day following several days of rain. Cass is a friendly cave in the dry sea-
sons, but it can be an ordeal in wet weather if proper precautions are not taken.
Tom Vigour and I had visited the cave several months before, during dry
weather. We had negotiated the drop quite comfortably using single brar bar and
5/8 inch dry manilla rope,
. The drop from the belay loft is 180 feet and normally the rigging is com
pletely away from the waterfall. Zsee National Geographic Magazine, June 1964,
page 825 if you want a picture of the whole problem. This time things were dif-
ferent; it wasn't the same cave we had visited earlier. Because of the recent
rain, the waterfall had grown to tremendous proportions and presented a fantastic
spectacle under such conditions. To borrow Huntley Ingalls' description: "It's
the most infernal sight I've ever seen in any cave. "
At the top, the rope stands free of the waterfall, but because of the inima
creased tr√¶jectory of the water in wet weather, the stream falls very close to the ..
bottom of the rope. The waterfall is narrow at the top, but after falling 140 feet
it forms a blinding oascade 20 feet wide and about 10 foet thick.
