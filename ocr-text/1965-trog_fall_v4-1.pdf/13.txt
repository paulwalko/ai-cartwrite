At our last discourse, I noted a bit of worry in Mr. Freeman's conversation.
He told me that two weeks before some cavers had come out of his cave very early in
the morning and one loud voice had awaken him. The week after that someone left his
gate open. He was worried that a hog might get 10oso and run into the road, where
it would cause an auto accident. In West Virginia, he would be responsible for the
damage to the car as well as losing his hog. He didn't say he was worried, but a
man of his age shouldn't be caused worry by his guests. Will, eventually, šuch
friendly people like Mr. Freeman close their gates to cavers? The answer is defi-
nitely yes, if cavers continue to make a nuissance of themselves, if they continue
to display a lack of common courtesy, and if they retain an attitude that they have
a right to explore every hole in the earth.

AROUND THE REGION
Probably the biggest regional event in the near future is the annual fall
meeting. This year we will be host grotto and we have so far made many preparations,
for accomodations. Regional Chairman. John Cooper, can be expected to do his usual
fine job of recruiting a good list of speakers for the afternoon and evening pro-
grams.
The meeting will be held at the Wesley Foundation in Blacksburg on Saturday,
October 9; registration will begin at noon, the meeting at I PM. Papers and pro
grams will re, presented during the afternoon; a publications desk will sell regional,
grotto, and national publications. A steak dinner can be obtained at a low cost by
all those who sign up for it at registration time, but reservations must be made then
since we have contracted for a private room in a nearby restaurant. After dinner,
comes the evening program, parts of which will probably be illustrated with slides.
There are several motels in town and arrangements are being made for the use of the
town park-playground for camping. This will probably be a good place for any
parties.
On Sunday, it is hoped that all those still in town will take advantage of the
many nearby caves. The VPI Grotto is planning numerous trips and private ones will
be easy to arrange.
It is hoped by this writer that' a due amount of time will be given to regional
business, besides that spent on the election of officers.
John Holsinger införmed me recently that he will be present. Sometime during
the conference, he wishes to gather together those people who are seriously inter-
ested in doing continued work on the Virginia Cave Survey. Only those who have a
genuine desire to assist in gathering data or in Virginia caves are asked to attend.
Areain the state needing further work will be assigned to individuals. A list of
caves which need mapping will be distributed.
John also informed me that he plans to give a short talk on the present status
and future plans of the Virginia Cave Survey" as a part of the afternoon program.
