We noticed lots of people who took Cooper's advice (in the latest BGN) lit-
erally. They would' enter the men's room with copies of the latest Tech Troglodyte
and BGN, eat the TT, then use the BGN for toilet paper. -

FROM THE BOOK, LIMERICKS, PUNS, AND OTHER TALES:
A VERY PUNNY STORY #37.
I
In a fairly recent issue of the BGN, we read a ten-page trip report by John
Cooper that sounded more like a philosophy book than a visit to Cass Cave. (Looked
like it too - Assoc. Ed.)
Now, we hate to go out on a limb and risk sowing a seed that might sprout up
into a fuíl-fledged feud, but we think John's flowery report was a bit too colorful.
We like to see cavers branch out into different types of writing, but sometimes a .
budding writer fails to blossom.
We hope this articles doesn't cause John to turn green, but part of our criti-
cism stems from his philosophy and this may be the time to root out our differences,
since we'd rather be pedaled his ideas in some other way.
Before we make any real criticism, John, wooden it be better to talk about
this calmly, without beating around the bush, and instead of feuding and making re-
marks about each other's family tree? We'll turn over a new leaf and stop barking
æt other grottos 'if you will. It might stunt their growth. Let's bury our differ-
ences and see what germinates.
Normally, we'd go into detail about John's article and explain our differences,
but in this case there are many instances in John's article where he doesn't make
him quite clear (A, Edi beats around the bush, so to speak). And, though he just .
seems to lumber along, John has treed many an opponent with his fertile wit,
So, rather than soil John's good (chuckle) name, we'll Just say that there are
some parts of his philosophy with which we disagree and we'll end right there.
All this writing has me bushed.
