In the Cave Olympics, Doug Bradford combined enough points to receive second
overall and Greyson Harding won the first place award of 150 ft. of Goldline. (We *

John Cooper, who uses an electric headlamp, won 50 pounds of carbide for his
efforts in the Hellholo roscuo. Because John is such a good friend of VPI (and
