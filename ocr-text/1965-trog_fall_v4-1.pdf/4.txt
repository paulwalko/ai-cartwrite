ORKASL TRAI:I:IG PROGRAM FOR PROSPECTIVE III: BERS OF A STUDERT GROTTO, as
proseated at the 1965 in Convention in Bloomington, Indiana,
As might be imagine. From the title, this paper will be of more interest to
members of student grottues than others, for tido reason explained bolova
I think it is important for a student grotto to have a strong new-member
training program because there ure problems and factors peculiar only to student
grottoos.
Student grottoos usually have a large influx of members at one particular
time of the year. $ makes :1. difficult for those that are already members to
adequatoly train t:c1: prospective mer bers. For example, at the beginning of
the academic year in the fall of 1964, the VPI Student Grotto had between 20 and
30 people wł10 f.e interested in caving and in joining in the grotto's activities.
at the same time, there are only 15 to 20 active members of the grotto. The
prospective bors incluard one boy vilo had never engaged in any form of physi-
091 activity some that had read boołu: 011 cavins, some that had been to comme
cial caris, "thers that had uno some hiking, and even one who had been caving
and in the 1995 for the past 11 yeerii. So that our grotto nicht function
effsciently add progress, we had to main these people as quickly as possible.
Hou someone risht say, Jy kint a training program in the first place; why
not fust let cle or two of these neorie tag alons on a trip and eventually thoy
will learn all they need to lenou?!
ilot sol his cannot be done for three reasons:
He uel 11y have a transpo.ition problem at the beginning of the school
yoar. There are not enouri cars. For this reason, a halfway derom
cratic :ethod must be used o determine which of the neu herbers go on
whicl tips. If all of tho: 3 new people are evenly and adequately
towanee', this problem is som uhat ebated.
The nati13 of the caves in 112 eroa of Blacksburg is another reason.
Whilo na regular crolitoes 19 located in population centers, student
grottoes can be found loser la concentrations of caves, VI'I is no
exceptioı; Blacksburg is within tio hours driving-time of the extensive
horizontal caving area of Grecinter County, est Virginia and is in
the lieart of an area containin one of the deepest am most complex
cave systems of Virginia. A WC or pleasure trip to either of these
areas can be turned into a nir i'ars 11 an inadequately trained person
accompanies the party.

I believe that there is probally very near the same percentage of stum
dents interested in outing in i very large college. If these stuäents
can be encouraged to join the xisting student grotto and to partici..
pate in their training progren, they, in turn, will be able to pass on
safety and conservation ideal! to others. It will core than likely be
one of these students who vi17 be asked hy a fraterity, the boy scouts,
or some other similar group lead them on a caving tripe
