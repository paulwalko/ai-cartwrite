ROANOKE COUNTY CAVES
The book, Caves of Virginia, while doing a very good job of presenting a large
quantity of data, does contain certain errors in description and/or location of
caves in Roanoke County, as follows:
Salem Quadrangle: wostmoantral sector:
McNeils Cave (37020'12" x 8001114591). Elevation: 2300 feet.
The given location is about 0.5 milo too far northoast. The correct Location is as
above.
Shepherd Cave (37019758" x 80012'52") ""
The given location is about 0.5 mile too far west, and in the wrong sector of the ***
quad. The correct location is that recorded above. The description notes the cave
as ending in a small room with no leads. In reality, there are two leads" from this
room yiending about 150 feet more passage, giving a total length of over 300 feet,
Salem Quadrangle: southwest sector:
D.E. Custer Cave (37019147" * 800132911)
The Iatitude noted in the book is correct; the longitude is corrected as above, :"
The "large impressive entrance is a four foot wide slot on a 550 slope at the base
of a rock face.
Robert Custer Cave (3701985611 X 80°13'03") Elevation: 2160 feet.
Location corrected.....
Newman Cave (37°19'44" x 80°13'341)
The longitude is corrected, placing the cave west, not east of D.E. Custer Caves
The cave contains only 40 feet of passage. .

MORE CAVING ON THE TRAIL OF THE LONESOME PINE
Listed in this article are: descriptions of some Russell County caves that were.
located and explored by the VPI Cave Club this summer.
.
After we had explored one of the caves, it was called to our attention by a
local resident that a group from "up north" had explored the cave a few years ago,'.
To our knowledge, the information gathered by that group was never published, but it
was interesting (and a bit surprising) to find out that other groups besides VPI
have been working in that area.
The information given here will undoubtedly find its wäy into the first supple-
ment of Caves of Virginia when it is published in 1970, But meanwhile, to help prema
vent other groups from working over the samë areas, all information gathered by the
VPI Grotto will be published as it is received in the Tech Troglodyte.
