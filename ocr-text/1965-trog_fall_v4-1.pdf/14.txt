As usual, the summer months have proven very productive for caving activity
in this area. The McClung Cave (Greenbrier County, West Virginia) Survey has been
completed. Other work in the Groenbrier area continues, always threatened bờ rain
and high water. This past weekend the Higgenbotham #1 (Virginia) project was com-
pleted; look for the complete survey and map in the next Troglodyte. :'Whitt contin-
ues to find caves in Russell County and Holsinger is raving, as usual, about the
many big ones of: Lee County. Mike Hamilton has also been busy looking and mapping
in the Saltville area where he has been working.

MAP OF NEW RIVER CAVE' REDISCOVERED
While weking for the U. S, Gypsum Company this summer, I met Mr, Ed des Rocher's.
who was in the VPI Gott fi'cm alvut 1950-1952. I talked with him several times i
Arzt: caving and one day he asked me if I had ever been in New River Cave. We dism
cussed New River for a while and he said, "You know, I think I have something you
might be intorestod in... . Benck about 1951, Earl Thierry and I surveyed the cave and
I believe I still have the map.!!..
A short search of his office revealed an old mailing tube containing EarI..
Thierry's original sketch, the old „original map covering the area up to the water-
fall, and Ed's map of the big area beyond the waterfall. We even found the origi-
nal survey notebook!
The maps are legible but somewhat discolored and rather brittle because of;
age. The old mailing tube had been in a dusty closet for over ten years. :::::
I'm re-drawing the entire map and it will be placed in the files along with
the old ones this fall. .

LABOR DAY WEEKEND IN FRANKLIN - REVISTED
Friday night found Charlie Maus and I frantically piloting iny battered VW tornar
through the darkened alleys of Covington, Virginia. We had been mapping in the ex-
tensive Bone-Norman system in Greenbrier County, West Virginia, all day and were
pretty tired. Here we were on our way to the old Timers Reunion, the curfew hour
of 11 pm quickly approaching, and still we .could find no beer. ;
Eventually the dark clouds lifted, and the moon" shown bright on the familiar
lettering of what must have been: Covington's. only ABC. store.
