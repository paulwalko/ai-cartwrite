goes to the top of a hill. From the top of the hill, the cave is 750 yards east
along the ridge, and 50 yards east of a small long barn. From the small entrance,
a dirt slope leads down to a large passage six feet wide and 30 feet high. The
passage trends 250 feet southwest as a high canyon, ending in a mud and breakdown
fill. An upper level parallels the lower level for the last 50 feet and is similar
in character.

FINDINGS IN RICH VALLEY.
Rich Valley, located in Smyth County between Walker Mountain and the North
Fork of the Holston River, is characterized by sinking streams, dry stream beds, and
many sinkholes. It is an area where several ôf the larger, more prominent caves
were located in the early 1950's while many smaller caves remained indefinitely 10-
çated or not found at all. The following clarifies two cave positions and helps to
more clearly orient several others.
Sheep Hole (The Pit) Smyth County, Va., (36054'59" x 81°33'50") Elév: 2220
Chatham Hill Quad. In a perpendicular line to county route 670, the cave is 600
yards southeast, on the top of a small rock-covered hill overlooking a bar (to the
, West) and a house and the road to the north. The entrance is in the west side of
the hill with an opening about 10 feet wide and 10 to 15 feet long. The depth is
35 feet, and the entrance room is bell-shepec, The floor immediately beneath the
entrance is covered by debris, among which sheep bones and carcasses are the most
prominent. The cave, obviously, has long been known as a place for disposing of
dead sheep.
· Waterfall Pit Smyth County, Va., (36054156" x 8103313711) Elev, 2160 Chatham
Hill Quad. The cave is 700 yards in a perpendicular line from the road, and is west
of Sheep Hole. The cave acts as a swallow hole for a stream flowing to the North
Fork of the Holston River from Walker Mountain. Water from this stream may eventu-
ally flow by subterranean means to the stream 2500 yards west. The stream flows in-
to the cave in wet seasons and appears to do so with great force for there is all
sorts of trash above the entrance. - logs, wire, and rocks of all sizes. The en-
trance drop is about 15 feet; the walls are 5 to 10 feet apart, Directly opposite
the point where the water falls is a crawlway which pinches out in about 10 feet;
It trends to the left, and is halted by a dirt and rock fill. One is able to dis-
cern on one side of the fill that a passage of some sort continues beyond the fill.
