So, lets get together and clean up Breathing. Cave; And, everybody, please,
watch whore you dump your carbide. Dig a hole, bury" it; carry it out; but don't ***
just drop it where everyone who comos after you can see it. Etiquette in caving is
certainly lacking.

WANTED: A LITTLE THOUGHT
More than one person has commented to me on the attitude displayed in an
article by Dave Strope entitled "Wanted, a litte cooperation" (Troglodyte, Spring
1965).
This attitude is one unfortunately held by a great many cavers; it is the
attitude that cavers have some God-granted right to explore all caves regardless of
the feelings and objections of the particular landowner. It is the attitude that
the cave owner must explain his motives for not granting permission to enter a cave.
It is the attitude that landowners are unintelligent fools who hold no claim to the
activities which take place on their land.
I feel, along with many others, that the major conservation problem has-
shifted somewhat from cave vandālism to landowner relations. Consider the following:
points.
..
A cave owner very seldom benefits from pwning the entrance to a cave. In most
instances, it is bothersome, inconvenient, and often, expensive for him to leave the
entrance open.
A caver is a guest of the cave owner who holds legal title to the land,
Most caves in this area (West Virginia and Virginia) are located on small
farms; their owners are seldom wealthy and they certainly cannot afford any damage
to their crops or livestock, by which they make their living. If they think there
is any chance of a caver destroying their livelihood, they certainlý have every
right to stop thses cavers from coming there; they close their caves.
It is interesting to note that during the 165 National Convention in Blooming
ton, between 300 and 400 cavers were asked that supposing they owned a cavē, would
they allow other cavers to explore it. The reaction was an almost unamimous NO.
Recently I spoke with aging Mr. Freemar, whose home is located loss than 100
yards from McClungs Cave, West Virginia, Nicer cave owners are hard to find. In
the past, he has consented to letting many cavers park on his lawn; he has allowed
cavers to sleep in his new barn; in 1962, he allowed over 30'cavers in his cave at
once (Va. Region Project). He passes on directions and notes from one caver: to
another. He enjoys extended chats with people that have seen his cave. He wants
to know what they have found. He likes to get postcards and notes in the mail.
