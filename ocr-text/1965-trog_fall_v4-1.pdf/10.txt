new, the rappel will bo rather rapid and some other device, such as a
tandem system, is probab].y safer. The above is generally true for lon-
ger rappels, but if the rappel is relatively short, the single brake" bar
is quite safe -- assuming, of course, that the person rappeling knows how
to use it properly.
(2) When wet, manilla rope swells and, to some degree, slows down a rappel.
In the case of nylon (again, this is my own opinion -- subject to debate):
(3) When used on k!l nylon rope, the single brake bar method is not unsafe.
in most instances, if the drop is fairly short and the person rappeling
is experienced. However, as I've emphasized in the preceding "war
story, some other method (such as a tandem system) is much safer if the
drop is longer and the person rappeling is inexperienced.
(4) When used on new 7/16!! nylon, the single brake bar usually provides a "
rather frightening "express elevator" ride - especially if the drop is''
long and the rope is new. Again, the problem is one of friction: under
such circumstances, the single brake bar does not provide enough fric-
tion, An excessive amount of friction must be exercised by the person
rappeling. It is normally dissipated through the seat and hands. If
pads aren't used, you may have just a warm rappel or you might get some
nasty and very painful blisters. Worse still, when things begin to get
hot, it's a little more difficult to control the rappel.
If the rope is wet, pads and leather gloves get wet, and friction in all
parts of the system is quickly reduced. This was at least a contributing factor in .
Dianne's case.
.
The efficiency of most devices in controlling a rappel depends, to a large
extent, on the amount of tension in the standing line below the point at which the
device is acting on the rope. In most cases, the friction across the hips and hands
serves to increase this tension and thus increase the friction. So now we have a
friction-tension-friction system. Friction exercised by the person rappeling
causes tension in the rope and results in friction across the device. The total
effect makes it possible to control a rappel.
On longer rappels, the weight of the rope often presents a problem. The ten-
sion in the rope below the rappeling device is not constant. It decreases as the
rappel proceeds, and the difference must be make up for by the person rappeling if
the rate of the rappel is to be controlled. With some devices, such as the spool,
it is possible to "add-a-turn" while rappeling and thus compensate for the loss in
tension.
Each situation is unique, and different rappeling devices provide variable
amounts of friction. A safe method is one that the person rappeling can control ..
easily and which enables him to stop completely if necessary.
