TRIP REPORTS
DEAD AIR CAVE
8/21/65
by Anne Braithwaite
Personnel: Barry Whittemore, Bob Swensson, Gene Harrison, R.E, Whittemore,
The purpose of this trip was to photograph and to survey the cave." Surveying
was conducted by the two Whittemores and myself while Bob and Gene did extraeurricu,
lar exploring and other assorted duties.
The cave' was rigged with one rope to the ledge 40 feet below the entrance.
The ledge forms a balcony above the big room of the cave and two“ bolts are in the
wall at the edge of the ledge. We decided not to trust the bolts and tied another
rope to the first. At the ledge, the crawlway was identified, but we decided to
enjoy a free rappel, a mero 56 feet (taped). The cave, essentially, is one large
room. Below the entrance to the right are several large pits. To the left is a
sloped "pith and an adjoining hill, all of breakdown. The room extends to the left
beyond the breakdown hill for about 80 feet. The floor of this room is flat and
the mud has been uniquely carved by water. At the far end of the room, several
"canyon" passages continue, one of these becomes a miserable fissue and crawlway.
At the breakdown pile, a passage to the northeast goes up to one side of the
big room, becoming a "balcony passage." Further to the northeast, the crawlway
sighted at the ledge below the entrance joins this passage. Anyone with ã mind to
avoid rappeling whenever possible should be assured that the rappel is easier and
much more enjoyable, unless, of course, you like to wallow in mud.
· The formations in the cave are exquisite. Unfortunately, most are on the
floor, and are easy prey to fatfooted, stupid cavers. Most striking were the "Zoad-
stools" on one side of the breakdown ipit." . These were short, squat stalagmites
with slightly rounded tops, Many were white, although some were brown" or gray. At
rare times, when the sun?s rays infiltrate the darkness, the ceiling is visible and
is magnificently studded with formations. Fortunately, these are far away from
crunching boots and stealing hands of would-be vandals.

We ascended out of the cave, amerged into the warm night air, and returned to
Blacksburg by 3 am.
