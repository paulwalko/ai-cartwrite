The standing line was a fairly new inch goldline. It was wet, having been
dragged through the water crawl, and I decided to use a double (or tandem) brake
bar system with a chost priisik safety.
I reached the bottom in a confusing swirl of wind and noise. The falling
water pushes the air forward as it falls, causing large gusts of wind and resulting
in a huge spray which envelopes the area near the falls. It gradually collects on
the rope to form a steady flow of water down the last 50 feet. Rocky decided to
use the same method I had used, and he soon joined me at the bottom; however, when
he was about eight feet from che bottom, he stopped momentarily. I pulled the rap-
pel rope, swinging him over on top of a boulder to prevent him from landing (as I
had done) too close to the base of the falls.
Dianne began her descent next. She was somewhat experienced in horizontal
caving and had visited Hellhole the day before. She had used a double brake bar.
device but didn't like it. This time she wanted to use a single brake bar and a
chest prusik safety. This was a bad decision under the círcumstances; because of
her relatively slight vertical experience, she should not have been allowed to use
that particular method without a belay. But a belay was not possible in this situ-
ation.
She rappeled slowly. When she was about 30 feet from the bottom I positionėd
myself to swing her over the top of the boulder as I had done for Rocky; however,
as she approached the bottom, she suddenly lost her grip on the rappel rope,
screamed "falling", and fell free about 15 feet to the breakdown-covered floor in
the edge of the falls. The rope pulled me from my position and I fell about five
feet, Rocky and I scrambled to her. She yelled above the loud stead roar of the
waterfall that she was 0.K. We helped her up the breakdown slope, away from the
drenching falls.
Other than a rather battered hardhat and a small cut' on her head, she was all
right; however, we decided to take no chances. -- I signaled the others that we were
coming up. Using prusiks, I made a painfully slow ascent through the spray.“ Dianne
followed shortly afterward using Rocky's mechanical (jumar) ascenders. The spray
put her carbide light out soon after she started and she had to finish most of her
ascent in darkness. "
I reached the Belay Lost and explained what had happened. Paul Helbert rap-
peled down to the Soler Ledge to give Dianne some light. She soon reached the Loft
and appeared to be 0.K.
Dianne did not release her chest prusik safety when she fell, but she was
lucky. Had she fallen from a higher level, our trip may have ended in tragedy.
ZIt may be well. to. note that without mechanical ascenders, the ascent under her own
power would have been extremely difficult, if not impossible,
Now to get back to the point in question: is the single brake bar or any
other rappoling device always best?: No, of course not!
A few more observations:

The single brake bar seems to provide a safe and comfortable descent when
used on 5/8" and " dry manilla rope; however, if the rope is brand
