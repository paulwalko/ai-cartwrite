First we took a short side trip to Groundhog Mountain for a spectacular view
of the local countryside. From the old log tower on Groundhog Mountain, a long seg-
ment of the rugged Blue Ridge Escarpment can be seen, including the portentious.
upper reaches of the Dan River Gorge, with its curious pinnacles looming up from it's.
depths.
Our excitement thus whetted, we left our wind-blown perch and headed for the
fabled pinnacles.
As we turned onto the dirt road that approaches the pinnacles, we noted with
interest a long-forgotten "Appalachian Trail - Maine to Georgia" marker tacked to
the back of a stop sign. Later we wondered how hikers in those days negotiated some
of the local trails" with full backpacks, A short ride beyond this marker took us
to the nearest point accessible by automobile to the pinnacles' themselves. The sur-
rounding countryside in this area one of relatively low relief, but always domina-
ting the landscape is an enormous void from which protrude tree-covered peaks and
barren rock faces, Lewis Pedigo, in The History of Patrick and Henry Counties, said
"The scenery presented by the passage of the Dan River down the mountain and into
the flat country is awful and sublime to the highest degree." Even from our distant
Vantage point, we could see that there was much truth in this description. .
Looking at a topo map of the area, one may easily conjecture upon the geolog-
ical history of the gorge and the pinnacles. The Dan River rises in a high meadow
on somewhat the same level as the New River drainage area. Undoubtedly, the Dan
River was once a tributary of the New River, whose nearest point is about 25 miles
away. The New River drainage area is characterized by a very slight gradient, since
Ã¶t has some 3000 miles to meander before it reaches sea level at the Gulf of Mexico..
On the other hand, streams that flow eastward through the Blue Rdidge have only about
300 miles to make the 2800-foot descent to sea level at the Atlantic Ocean. There-
fore, streams, such as the Roanoke River, that have escaped ' over the Blue Ridge,
are characterized by deep valleys, rapid descents, and rugged terrain, Eons ago,
when the Dan River flowed westward to the New River, it was a slow, lazy stream,
forming long meanders and oxbow lakes. But as years went by and the land eroded
away, the lazy meanders cut dangerously close to the steep face of the mountain,
Finally, it found a weak spot and made its escape over the 1500-foot escarpment into
the Piedmont below. In the next several centuries, the river, now flowing at a tre-.
mendously accelerated rate, began to cut a deep gorge, entrenching itself into the
upland meadows. Today, the old meandering course of the river is still preserved,
but instead of flowing along the rolling meadows, it is a swift, plunging line at the ..
bottom of a yawning gorge, with almost vertical walls rising directly" from the
waters' edge. In one place along the course, the river, before it' was entrenched,
made a wide loop about a half mile across. When the gorge was cut, a cone-shaped
pinnacle was left in the center of the loop, connected to the surrounding meadows
by a narrow saddle.
Our group descended by a faintly-defined path until the footway turned abrupt-
ly downward. The opposite face, about a: half: mile away presented itself as a menacin
wall, having many vertical rock faces and scarcely enough soil to support the scrubby
aspens growing there. Rising above us was a grotegge heap of rocks with a few stun-
ted aspens growing from various crevices and ledges. The average slope was about
sixty degrees. The bottom of the gulf below us could not be perceived, but appeared
as a bluish mist through the trees, Lewis Pedigo described the gorge from this point
