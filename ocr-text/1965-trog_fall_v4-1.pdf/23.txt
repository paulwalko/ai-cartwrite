NOTES ON SOME WYTHE COUNTY RAMBLINGS -
During the second session of summer school, I made two trips to Max Meadows,
Virginia, acting on a letter sent to the VPI Cave Club.by George Jackson of Max
Meadows, stating that there were four caves in the immediate area that had never been
fully explored.
The area is only slightly above the water table, so everything is on a small
scale.
Explorations were made by John East's," Gene Harrison, Mike Youso, Dan" Weatherly,
John Peduzzi, Jim Wade and myself. Here is a brief report of the caves explored,
only the last of which is worth visiting. ..

George Jackson, Max Meadows, Virginia, .The entrance is a 3 by 3 foot hole in a level
