Friction should be caloužated and tension predicted before choosing the realme
ppeling method. No, I don't suggest that you carry your slide rule and CRC tables.
An educated guess, supplemented by good judgement based on some experiorice, is
ụsually the best answer to the whole problem.

CARBIDE DUMPS SHOCK CAVER
"Careless Cavers Destroy Caves." This is an oft-heard" phrase on a subject
much talked about and written about. Who is it that deströy's the beauty of our
caves in the United States? . Is it dedicated cavers or those who make caving a one
OL two-shot spree? Or is it a person who knows no better and/or cares less?
What can üe do about the carelessness, the urge to destroy and the non-conser-
vation practices of our fellow cavers?" Sure, the NSS has a conservation Committee
and the Regions have interested persons, but what is being done? Individual occur
rances pop-up all the time but no action is takëni Oan individuals do something?"
They oan,“ A group may "olean up" a cave, as was done to Giant Caverns three years
ago. This is what should be done in Breathing Cave.. Those who have previously.
visited the cave should be aware that the cave is not what it once was.
i Breathing Cave, in Highland County, Virginia, has been onē of my favorite .
caves since I first visited it in 1962. In the past three years I have visited the
cave four times, two of which were four-day trips spent in the cave. The cave, to
me, is particularly challenging for the many forms of cave traversing necessary, and
requires a variety of techniques with various grades.of difficulty. It is a cave
which I feel is equally suited for the beginner and the experienced caver.
A last trip to the cave during the Virginia Region-MAR Speleo-Go-Go In July,
1965 revealed some very disturbing sights. The entrance crawl waſ and the sandy
sleeping room are littered with trash, garbage, flash bülbs and spent carbide, The
passages from the sleeping room to the waterfall are disgustingly Lettered with ..
spent carbide. It looks as if people used carbide dumps instead of rockicairns or
nylon cord to find their way out of the cave. I was very shocked. I also obsėrved
that bats no longer inhabit the Bat Room, nor are they to be found in the main pas-
sages of the cave, I wonder what this signifies.
.
I had been to Breathing Cave previously in the summer of 1964, and the wantoni
destruction was not in evidence at that time, I am of the opinion that the destruc-
tion of the cave is due to a more widespread knowledge of the cave's location since
the publishing of Caves of Virginia, (The dates of my last visit and the availabil
ity of the book correlate). I think that since everybody and his brother are able :
to purchase a copy of the book (to make ends meet), those who don't care and don't
know any better have found that Breathing is a good 'cave, to explorë, The cave is
fairly accessible, and with those nice reprints of topographic maps in the back of
Caves of Virginia, very easy to find.
