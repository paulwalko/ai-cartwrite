as "The declavity of the mountains... the depth of the basin is beyond view and ap-
pears to be incalculable."
We descended the steep path for several hundred feet until we reached the *
narrow causeway connecting the pinnacle with the canzon wall. The windy ridge was
no more than twenty feet wide, with a nearly vertical drop on each side. The bottom
of tho gorgo appeared to be no closer than it did before the somewhat ardrous descent
A hort walk took us to the base of the first of the three pinnacles. The
first, two, or "false" pinnacles, are not quite as high as the main one, but have
more jagged rock outcrops. Between the first and second false pinnacles is a plate
of rock cantilevered out over what appears to be a drop of several hundred feet.
From this vantage point, the entire, upper end of the valley can be seen. To the
right is 1Bursted Rock, it a sheer cliff of over hundred feet. One thousand feet be-
low is the thin silver thread of the Dan River. Somewhere upstream, obscured by
trees, aro the Great Falls of the Dan River and Haunted Falls. Spanning' Haunted.
Creek Gorge is a steel arch viaduct supporting a four-foot diameter pipe, the Dan-
ville Penstock. It stands as a silent reminder that inspite of the awesomeness of
this natural creation, Man is the most awesome creation of all. A dam at Round
Meadow Creek supplies water to the pipe, which spans gorges, traverses canyon walls,
pierces the saddle below the pinnacles at Low Cap Tunnel, and finally plunges nearly
1000 feet to drive a turbine which powers the city of Danville. Thank goodness they
found this place before the Army Corps of Engineers did; the Corps would have built
fourteen earth-fill dams in the gorge.
· The view down the valley is spectacular, being one of more pinnacles, high
walls, and a misty, silhouetted cleft through which the river makes its escape into
· the Piedmont,
The final ascent to the main pinnacle involves scrambling over barren slabs
of micaceous schist, with an occasional quartz-filled joint for variety. The top
of the peak is about 20 feet by 20 feet and affords an excellent view of the entire
valley. The course of the river below can be traced as it makes a long, nearly cir-
cular, loop around the base of the peak. The rolling meadows bordering this gulf
can be seen stretching for miles on each side, this vantage point being on a level
with them.
One may wonder how a trip report such as this one found its way into a journal
of speleology, but one visit will show that this place has many aspects in common
with caving. A certain amount of physical exertion is rewarded by a spectacle un-
seen and undefiled by unappreciative mobs. Perhaps it is fortunate that people
still retain primitive superstitions and fears of caves. It keeps out many people
who don't deserve to see what lies therein.
