LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Dear Boby
:
I was mighty glad to see your list of Virginia caves over a mile long and also
John Holsinger's comments on your list.
Newberry-Bane -- Sorry to disappoint you on the survey notes, but I no longer
have all of them. I took all the footage off the map shortly after I ::.:.:.
plotted it and came up with two miles plus 1265 feet. In 1957, Joe
Lawrence sent me the enclosed plan of about 660 feet more, which he had
drawn of the Zig Zag passage. This makes a total of two miles and 1900
feet. I am not familiar with the area below the Straddle Pit, but I see ...
no reason why a prominent tie-in point on the existing map can't be used
to map any additional passage. I have always thought it would tie-in to
Penley's Cave but had no luck doing so,
Buchanan Saltpeter Cave -- I got only 6700 feet from the map, and to the best
of my knowledge the map contains all of the cave. In fact, I never did
get as far downstream as the map .shows. I realize that a plan map is a
poor source to scale off a cave which contains several levels, but from :
personal knowledge I would say the cave contains no more than 7000 feet i
at the most. Stephenson said "about 27 miles of passageil in 1948, which
was long before the cavo was completely explored and mapped. No more
than 7.25 miles.
Paxton's Cave -- I visited this one only once, just briofly in 1947. A re-
cent Cavalier Caver said almost a mile mapped. It should contain well.
over a mile.
Cribb Cave -- Washington County. A maze-type cave. I sketched a half mile
of it in 1950 and Lee Skinner added several hundred feet in 1961. I
think this one is much more than a mile.
New River Cave -- You say over 6000 feet has been mapped. I thought a lot
more than that had been mapped. I'll have to wade through a lot of old
reports and notes and see.
I's/

Editor's note: Earl's remarks on New River Cave are timely with Mike Hamilton's ".
discovery of the old Now. River Cave map. Perhaps the two should get together.

The following section of this journal contains information on new caves found
in Virginia as well as new information on already-known caves in Virginia. We have
worked at checking in detail those caves noted by a letter and/or for the record
only as designated in Caves of Virginia, in order to have some informative data on
each Inown cave.
