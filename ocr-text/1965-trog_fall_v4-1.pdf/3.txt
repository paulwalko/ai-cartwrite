EDITOR'S COLUMN
For those of you who weren't around this summer, the following is to bring you
up to date on the activities of the club while you were making money and/or loafing,
The club organization continued smoothly throughout the summer, with R.E.
Whittemore doing a fine job as acting President. "Shorter meetings, longer orgies"
was his motto, although old business, committee reports, new business, trip reports,
trip plans, and Uncle Whitt's Mail Bag (a most entertaining pasttime) were conducted
æs usual. Minutes were sometimes taken by me, and during the 2nd session I became
treasurerl Orgies were most often held either at "the Ranch" or Plank's Cabin.
Although 7 or 8 people paid trainee dues, no formal training program was con-
Quoted. A trip to Maybrook Sinkhole several times for rappeling and prusiking prac-
tice was really the extent of our training; most of us have accumulated well over..
the 20 required hours of caving with a member of the Cave Club.
As usual, VPI Cave Club members have been working while: caving, contributing
their efforts to furthering speleology. Much exploration and mapping have been done
in Russell, Smyth, and Tazewell. Counties, Virginia, as well as in the Greenbrier Sys-
tem in West Virginia. No doubt, this work will continue through the school year.
The Old Timers Reunion at Franklin, West Virginia proved a time to make our-
selves well-known. Some people don't like our patches. Tsk. Others remembered
that we call ourselves the world's most active caving organization, and didn't think
We have the "right" to say that. If the shoe fits, wear it. But, five individual
Troglodytes were sold at 50¢ a piece; three subscriptions were sold, and two summer!
winter co-ops (from VPI) paid for a fall Troglodyte. Isn't it wonderful what women,
can do?!
. Well-known caves visited this summer included: Pig Hole; Old Mill, Tawney's,
Links; Dead Air, New River, s, t., Sinnit, Sites, Kenny Simmons, Keys, Buchanan Salt,
peter, Clover Hollow, Culverson: Greek, Friars Hole, and Cassells.
With a new thirty foot cable ladder, ten dollars worth of almost-new marilla
manilla (290 feet), and a whole new group of interested trainées, we should be off
on a new, active year with lots of accomplishments in mapping, more new cave dis-
coveries, perhaps a few more cleanod cavos, and some better landowner-aver relations
