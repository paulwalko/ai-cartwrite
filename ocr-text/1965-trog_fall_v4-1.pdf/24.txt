Jackson's #2 .(36059'18x 89053'41") Max Meadows Quad. The entrance is a
3 by 2 feet hole in the side of a small rock cut besido the road. Only several feet
above the stream level, on the same level as the road, About six feet long with
three leads that end very shortly.
A third cave is on the property of one known locally as Tom Böy Simmons. If
such & 'cavel deserves a name, let it be Tom Boy's Cave (36058'01" x 80057157").
The cave is actually two small caves five feet apart, approximately 200 yards bem
hind the lawn of two abandoned brick houses. A healthy spring flows" out of the
rocks slightly below the entrances. The larger of the two entrances is a twelve foot
crawl, parallel to the rock face; gradually going down to the stream level, and then
ending. The smaller entrance was a tight cravi (för me) which snaked along parallel
to the face and behind the other. It soon opens up to a narrow walking passage with
about six inches of water in the botton, approximately 20 feet long, then a mud
crawl to another room of st. milar dimensions, but without a stream. There is no
passage from this room, and no connection with the other cave, save a siphon." At
the very liberal most, 75 feet of passage, occasional stalagtites, salananders and
several bats,
Watson's Cave (36059:58!!. * 80053152) Max Meadows Quad. “On the property :
adjoining that of Mr. Jackson's, along the N & W railroad tracks, just off the
right of way are two small trapezoidal openings in a rock face, facing the tracks.
The smaller of the two entrances leads directly to the second room of the cave, and
the passage between the first and seconf room is not worth the effort,“ From the
room, æ passage below can bee seen through numerous cracks and crevices. All leads
from this room either dead-end or drop down to this level. There begins a long and
almost straight walking stream passage with several chimney,s leading to a mud sloped
upper-level. After about 600 feet' of a gradually dimminishing passage, there is a
20 x 4 x 14 foot room. From there, the going gets tough. Following and generally
crawling in the atroam in the bost way to doscribe it. 'Occasionally the low
ceiling allows hands and knees crawling, but more often it is a wormIike squeeze.
These squeezes get longer, the ceiling gets lower; and the water gets higher, until
the idea of pushing to the end gets disgusting. So, a liberal 2000 feet, the first
1000 being walk, stoop and crawl and the 1000 being described as above.
On the surface, there is a spring on the" approximate area of the crawl. No
passage is visible on the surface, so we all assumed the end to be a siphon. One
sink hole in the area seems to have promise, but is filled with wire fencing and
tree limbs. The owner says that he is the one who filled it in and there was no
icave there,
