CRICKET:
Ed loud first heard abou the cave now known as Cricket
while digging in a garbage dump in search of the precious
metal "Aluminum". The driver of a National Linen Service
truck knew the location and drew a rough sketch of it in
the dirt on the side of his vehicle. Unfortunately, though,
the National Linen severvice man drove off, taking the map
with him. Poor Ed was left with only his memory to serve
him.
Two days later, Ed enlisted the aid of mike Wolf, a
veteren of Blackenship's Blowhole and Budweiser Pit.. They
would search together for the missing National Linen Service
truck and find the cave, All day they searched in vain for
the truck.unce, along the 460 Bypass, they spotted two
of the trucks in convoy. A chase ensued as Ã¼d was hoping
that one of the trucks would be the truck. They finally
caught the trucks after four miles, but neither the truck
nor the man were to be found. They had been decoys! it
last, realizing the hopelessness of the situation, they
went off on their own; searching for the cave from memory.
Luckily, a friendly landowner came to their aid. Seeing
cd and Mike standing around looking confused with a bunch
of topo maps in hand, he asked if they were lost. Eventu-
ally, he gave the location of a cave that fit the meager
description that had been on the missing laundry truck.
After sixty minutes of torturous searching along Inter-
state 81, ed spotted the entrance.
Now the crew swung into action like the practiced
professionals they were. Quickly they readied themselves
to enter, only to procrastinate for thirty minutes in
discussing the possibility of animal life, particularly
dangerous animal life, in the cave. At last, they entered,
The cave was wondrous beyond belief. Only two hundred feet
long; it could be mapped in a single trip. A spent PBR
can laying on the floor of the cavern stood in mute testi-
mony to the fact that the cave was not virgin,
The following Saturday, the mapping crew came in.
Ed returned, this time with voug Perkins and bill Koerschner.
The cave was put on paper. No longer would Cricket Cave
stand as an unexplored gap in the files of the grotto.
Science reigned triumphant!
