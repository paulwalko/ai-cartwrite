|--The Spool--
Throughout the years of cave exploration, steep drops
have presented a challenge to the serious caver. Various ways
to get down these drops have been invented; such as the Bosun's
Chair, Rappel Ring, Rappel rook, Srake pars, whale Tail, and
Rappel Rack, to name a few. The purpose of this article is
to take a look at one of the older rappelling devices: The
Rappel Spool.
At one time the rappel spool was used for all types of
cave drops, but now it has been replaced by newer and better
equipment. With the advent of the brake bars, spools became
a long rappel device only. When the rack came out spools
became collectors items. However, for those people lucky
enough to own one, the sheer joy of a spool rappel makes it
worthwhile to occasionally resurrect the spool for some
sport rappelling.
But what, really, is the spool? The rappel spool has
never been standardized since everyone who has a spool either
had the spool made or made it themselves. Generally the
design for a rappel spool was either copied from someone
elses spool, or designed by the person making the spool.
However, all rappel spools do have two parts in common; the
spool (around which the rope is wrapped), and the support arms
(which prevent the spool from turning and connect the rappeller
to the spool X see figure 1).
A spool may be made from steel, aluminum, or even wood.
Steeel spools are generally made from a short piece of pipe,
two to four inches in diameter, with circular steel plates
welded to the ends, une support arm is welded to one end of
the spool and the other is supported by a bolt passing through
the spool. This allows one arm to be rotated to permit wrap-
ping a rope around the spool. After wrapping the rope the
two arms are held together by a carabiner through the holes
in the lower ends of the arms (See figure 2).
A spool of this type may have trouble with the rope
crossing itself and may require the use of "Pigtail" rope
guides to relieve the problem (See figure 3)
