FALL/WINTER
The Tech Troglodyte
1976
An aluminum spool is turned on a lathe from a circular
piece of aluminum bar stock, generally three to four inches
in diameter. Aluminum spools are tapered toward the center
of the spool to cause the main part of the rope to ride in
the center of the spool. The support arms on an aluminum
spool are set into slots milled into the ends of the spool
and secured by a bolt passing through the spool (See fig-
ure 4). Rope is put on the spool by removing one arm.

Wooden spools are made the same as aluminum spools ex-
cept for the material used. Wooden spools have a tendency
to char on a long rappel and to melt synthetic fiber ropes.
