Buckwheat Rises
Well, I guess it's time for the annual state of tne
of the Grotto Address. Take heart, it's not as bad as it
may appear. At least the State of the Grotto is much better
than the State of the Union, The recession is over. We are
on the road to recovery. We are the wealthiest grotto in the
Virginia Region and probably rank among the ten most wealthy
in the N.S.S.. ivan hours are up 400% (1500+ this quarter) over
last Spring. Our equipment and supply committees are increas-
ing their stocks. We have a large group of active trainees,
assuring the future leadership of the Grotto. Individuals
are undertaking their own projects with enthusiasm and hope-
fully this enthusiasm will spread throughout the membership,
particularly the trainees, with the result of projects in
various fields of interest. We are attempting to build a
respected rescue capability and have set aside $500 toward
this end, money and equipment have been donated to the
Safety and Techniques Committee hopefully for the betterment
of caving equipment and methods.
This increase in a wealth of resources has resulted in
an increase of recognition for this úrotto as a viable entity.
We are no longer considered a bunch of drunk college kids
(which we may well be; 'll not argue the point). We are
rapidly building the capability of becoming a strongly in-
fluential grotto in regional and national policies, provided
our efforts are properly directed and each of us remains in-
formed. What good does it do us to donate money to some ob-
scure project when our own Grotto can much better utilize
these funds? Become informed. Know what you are voting on
before you vote. Don't just vote in the name of conservation:
Think: What will be the consequences of your vote on our
fundamental purpose--the perpetuation of the Grotto, We
have a bright, promising future. It's up to all of us.
