Analysis of an Election
Doug Olson
The recent election of the coming year's club officers
was marked by very slim pickings and a host of "I don' wannas".
The new president, Ed Richardson, was voted in by acclimation,
for lack of a willing opponent worthy of nomination. The club's
reclamation project took the form of newly elected vice-pres-
ident, Lor Windle. Can an office of high stature turn a repu-
ted neo-nazi asshole into a self respecting, mature man of
responsibility?' "bull", you say??? Ubviously a majority of the
club members believed in the potential of Lor to properly han-
dle future club members.
The new treasurer, sock Bearden, was chosen basically be-
cause Susanne Sutherland appeared to be the least willing of
the two candidates. No need to worry about this office,
though--if Donnie can do the job, any inept half-wit should
be able to...even Jock.
Last, maybe least, the secretary, Doug Olson, won by vir-
tual default in that his opponent, the incumbemt Lor Windle,
was already elected vice-president. It is hoped that this dark
horse will be a productive officer and competent secretary
rather than choosing to sit in a corner, picking his nose, and
remaining virtually unnoticed.
. As former officers, President Mike Wolf, V.P. Bob Alderson,
and Treasurer Donnie Carter sink back into the multitude of
commoners and look forward to a glum year of bleak prospects;
we must appreciate their superhuman efforts over the past year
in helping turn the V.P.I. Grotto from violent bedlam to
simple random chaos. We must also give special consideration
to Lor who has mashed his nose further to the grindstone to
become V.P.
All in all, however, I believe that somehow the club did
an admirable job in electing officers of superior quality.
Ed. Column
Due to an unexpected and totally unprecedented streak
of good humor, there will not be an Editor's Column because
the Editor can't think of anything to complain about at the
moment that he hasn't bitched about before (see "bitch", in
The Tech Troglodyte, fall/winter, Vol. XIV, #1&2, page 2).
All I can say is thanks to the miserable few who helped and
that's that.
