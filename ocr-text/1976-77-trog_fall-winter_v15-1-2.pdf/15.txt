FALL/WINTER
The Tech Troglodyte
1976
Now, we have the finest beer and whisky, the wildest women
and the best cavers in the world!
You know, by God; I actually pity those poor DCGers we're
going up against, by God I do!
We're not just going to out drink the bastards. .
We're going to make them puke out their living guts,
and use them to grease the tires of our Toyotas!.
We're going to roll those lousy DCGers into the gutter by
the bushel!
Now, some of you trainees, I know are wondering, whether or
not you'll pass out after three or four beers.
Don't worry about it!
I can assure you, that you will all drink your gallon.
The DC Grotto is the enemy!
Four wheel into them!
Spill their beer!
Drink them under the table!
When you put your hand into a bunch of goo, that a moment
before was in your best friends stomach!
You'll know what to do.
Now there is another thing I want you to remember.
I don't want to get any messages saying that we are trying
to hold down our alcohol.
We're not trying to hold down anything!
Let the DC Grotto do that.
We are drinking constantly and we are not interested in
holding onto anything; except our beer mugs!
We're going to hold onto them with one hand and fill them
from the tapper with the other!
We're going to drink that beer all the time!
and it is going to go through us like piss through a
bladder!
Now..... there is one thing that you men will be able to say
when you get back to Blacksburg; and you may thank God
for it.
Four years from now, when you are standing around at the
party on the mountain and some trainee asks you, 'What
did you do in the great 77 Convention?'
You won't have to say: 'Well, I sipped Pepsi at the Photo
Salon.'
Alright now you sons of bitches, you know how I feel..
Oh; I will be proud to lead you drunken sots into a party,
any time and any where,
Now that's all."
