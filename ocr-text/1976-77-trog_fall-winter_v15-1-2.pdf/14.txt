COMBAT
Recently, while watching a rerun of the movie Patton
on TV, it occurred to me that partying must be very similar
to war. To illustrate this point, I wrote the following
parody of the first scene of the movie in which George C.
Scott as General Patton delivers a speech to his troops just
before they are due to go into battle.

The scene is Aggie Auditorium. The Grotto is restless.
It is shortly before they are due to be shipped out to Alpena,
They are waiting for something to happen. Suddenly, Buckwheat
shouts out an order, "Hey! Shut the fuck up!" The crowd
quiets down on the wall in front of the room is emblazoned
the VPI Grotto flag, yellow letters on black, a purple bat in
the upper right hand corner, Slowly, Ed Loud walks onto the
stage in front of the flag and stands before the silenced
membership. He is in full partying uniform, demin jacket
and jeans, partying hat upon his head, hiking boots, liter
beer mug at his side and covered from head to toe in mud, gar-
bage and day-glo paint, ne begins to speak;
"be seated!
Now I want you to remember,
that no caver ever killed a key by puking his guts out.
He killed it, by making the other poor dumb caver puke his
guts out!
Now men, all tnis stuff you've heard about Vpl not wanting
to drink, wanting to stay out of the party, is alot of
horse dung!
VPI traditionally loves to drink!
All real VPI cavers love to drink beer and raise hell!
When you were trainees; you all admired the champion beer
chugger, the fastest can crusher, the hard-core partier,
the toughest dancér.
VPI loves to party and will not tolerate sobriety!
VPI drinks like hell all the time!
I would'nt give a hoot in hell for a caver who drank two
beers and passed out!
That's why VPI has always killed the keys and will always
make it 'till dawn!
Because the very thought of going home sober; is hateful to
VPI cavers.
Nowi a grotto is a team, it drinks, pukes, parties as a team!
This individuality stuff is a bunch of crap!
The bastards who wrote that stuff about individuality; for
the DC Speleograph; don't know anything more about real
partying; then they do about caving!
