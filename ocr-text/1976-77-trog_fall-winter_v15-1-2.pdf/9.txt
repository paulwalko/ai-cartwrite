FALL/WINTER
The Tech Troglodyte
1976
Further adventures in the world of Alt. Cartwright in-
clude the massive exploration of two new caves: Cricket
Cave (a giant 200+ feet of passage) mapped by Ed Loud, back
in the action, and his friends; and Dead Cat Cave mapped with
much confusion by Ed "viddly-dip" Devine and Donnie "Cornhole"
Carter. At the time of this writing there may be an article
on the latter cave, mapping continues in bone-Norman and the
Seabolt project has started. At fall VAR on uctober 9th, the
V.P.I. Grotto announced 1000 man-hours underground since old
Timers!
The mighty Trogs grasp has extended to his friends and
enemies. The flow of people swirls about us all, jim Denton,
Jerry Redder, and Randykathy graduated last Spring. Denton
has moved in with Hixson. Randykathy Wood have jobs in Pitts-
burgh. Redder is working with Douty and Armstrong and lives
in Pearisburg. Jean and Bob Simonds have moved to Tidewater,
Bob and Ellen Page have moved West. The Frieders have gone
back to D.C..
On the other hand, Glen Davis has returned to school for
another try at success. Moose Dawson is taking more courses.
Doug "Thump-some" Thompson is somewhere around, apparently
going to school. Doug Perkins and bill Stringfellow are
together again after all these years; this time in Roanoke,
Danny and Lynn Wright went on a tour of Europe last Summer
and are now touring the U... of A. "Tuna" Johnson, so long
a respected (ha) member of the brotto has been awarded as
club advisor (Go-Between us and the school).
Other news of note: Denton, Hixson and Linda all got the
mange. They're not quite sure who got it from who!
The V.P.I. Grotto has smashed through two more striking
victories in the miller Reclamation contest last spring and
this Fall, claiming more than $1000 in prizes.
In the world of mechanized transportation, the name of
Alan Armstrong will long be remembered. Prior to UTR he
slept through the "Close association" of his car and a tel-
ephone pole. He is still waiting for parts. In close run-
ning there is Doug Thompson who, in a display of aquatic
finesse, sank his Toyota in the Potomac at Old Timer's. At
poor third is Chuck Shorten; he blew his VW engine and now
swears revenge with a jeep (named Yeep).
Of all the wild parties since last I talked to the world,
(Spring VAR, Jerry and Jackie's Wedding, Picnic, Float Trip,
Convention, Old Timer's, Fall VAR, and Halloween) only one
exciting event crosses my mind... Alan Armstrong's sheepish
philosophy at convention. It appears that while sitting
around the campsite a young, innocent girl wondered by. She
had been to 8 conventions and never knew cavers were gross
(she stayed in the dorms). Alan was talking about "Sheep
Fucking", going into considerable detail about putting their
hooves into your boots to hold them in place. She said that
she didn't know anything about that sort of stuff, Alan came
back with "well then, want to put your toes in my boots?"
vive never saw her again.
