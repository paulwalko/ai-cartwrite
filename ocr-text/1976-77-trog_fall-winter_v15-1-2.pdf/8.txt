FALL/WINTER
The Tech Troglodyte
1976
unce more the haunting melody sweeps down from the mount
of caving glory and descends into the plains of mortal men.
The wind picks the sound up and carries it across endless
limestone outcroppings and resurgent streams before laying
its cryptic message at the feet of those capable of hearing
the true meaning. It is with pains taking efforts that the
message has been translated into the written language of
man. Once more, you, too, can experience the awe and the
unprecedented wonder of
The Grotto Grapevine !
Sigh. It has been a long and glorious year (nearly) since
I have been granted the privilege of relating the exciting
adventures and escapades of the V.P.l. Grotto. It is with
unbounding enthusiasm that I can tell you that the grotto has
transposed, transpired and, to keep the same scheme, trans-
fered personnel and adventures. First and foremost is the
grotto election last spring. Richardson, Windle, bearden,
and ulson hold the key posts now (see belated election re-
rults elsewhere).
As always, Cupids mighty bow has showered arrows of love
and affection throughout the grotto. Last April jerry Redder
finally worked up the herve to go through with it and tied
it on with Jackie, Last Grapevine I made a comment about
how funny Tuna and like Richardson looked in tux's; jerry
had Jim Denton, Lor Windle and Ed Richardson in similar
apparrel: What a bunch of misfits!! Over the summer, Bob
Alderson finally took the bait and got hooked by Laura, and
Nark Slusarski caught a similar trap from Cathy. Recently,
mike frame and Suzanne came back from Alaska and permanently
melted the icicles (so to speak).
Similarly, the darts from cupids archery set have pinned
others. mike Wolf is going to marry (5)Pam on warch 5,'77.
Dennis Vaders is going to marry Linda no-body-knows when he
graduates. And no body does know what mike Richardson and
Tricia are doing in New Jersey right now. We also have a
lovely (in her own right) girl by the name of Pat Louden who
seems to be "engaged" with everyone at one time or another.
New potential cavers are also springing up like... hmm,
I can't think of an uninsulting analogy. At any rate, Karl
and Nancy Hamm have had their little hamster--a boy. And
last heard from, Lynn and Jim Altman are working on their
second.
Uther, more readily acceptable new cavers for V.P.I. are
(9) Pam Foiles, #192; Pete Sauvigne, #193 (Associate) i Rick
Cooper, #194; and Dave "Tinker" Bell, #195. hinda makes you
feel old doesn't it?
