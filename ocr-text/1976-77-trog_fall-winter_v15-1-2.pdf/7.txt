(sung to the tune of "Five Feet sigh and Rising")

How high's the water, Hixon? Two feet high and rising.
riow high's the water, Perkins? He said it's two feet high and rising.
Well I drove through the rain 'cause I heard the call,
Found everybody drenched in the meeting hall,
They're all drinking beer and don't care at all;
Two feet high and rising.
How high's the water, Annie? Three feet high and rising.
How high's the water, R.E.? She said it's three feet high and rising.
The stream's overflowing all it's banks nearby,
The mud in the field is at least ankle high,
Reminds me of convention down at V.P.1. i.
Three feet high and rising.
How high's the water, Stevens? four feet high and rising.
How high's the water, buiesser? I say it's four feet high and rising.
well, rain in the morning makes me feel uptight,
The bridge washed out in the middle of the night,
Have to drink another beer so i'll feel alright;
Four feet high and rising.
How high's the water, Redder? Five feet high and rising.
How high's the water, vouty? I've mapped it five feet high and rising.
If the rain don't stop I'll have to give a shout,
Water's close to crossing our only other route,
If it covers the road then we can't get out;
Five feet high and rising.
I say it'y five feet high and rising.
