FALL/WINTER
The Tech Tregledyte-
1976
The use of a spool is basically the same as any other
braking device, The rope is wrapped around the spool; the
spool is attached to a seat sling; and tne speed is controlled
by tension applied to the trailing rope. But what makes the
spool rappel so special when everything else is so normal?
Simply the characteristics of the rappel itself. in use,
a spool gains its braking effect almost entirely from slid-
ing friction. The friction from rope binding, from sudden
changes in rope direction, is negligible. What this means
is that when tension on the trailing rope is reduced, the
rope slides around the spool with almost no braking effect
--hence: a fast rappel. However, light tension on the trail-
ing rope increases the braking force very quickly--hence: sud-
den stops. These all-or-nothing rappel characteristics may
sound like a good way to commit suicide. They're not. These
characteristics exist only if the correct number of wraps are
used on the spool. A person learning to use a spool can add
extra wraps to increase friction and slow the rappel. If the
rappel still seems too fast, an additional wrap can be added
during the rappel to give even more friction.
To really understand the fun of a spool rappel one must
experience it. For anyone wishing to have his own spool, a
good machine shop should be able to turn one out for a moder-
ate cost.
