APRIL, 1976
I WAS AT A VAR WHEN I
NOTICED SUME PEOPLE DRIV-
INU BY SPILLING A DRINK
FROM A CANTCEN CUP. I
YELLED AT THEM TO BE MORE
CARENUL, THEY SLUWEN AND
ASKED ME IF I WANTED SOME.
I TOUR THE CANTEEN CUP AND
STARTED TO DRINK, I WAS
DETERMINED TU IMPRESS THEM
WITH MY DRINKING. I WAS
ABLE TO CHUG THE LIQUID
IN TWO GULPS ONLY TO FIND
UUT THAT IT WAS GRAIN AL-
CUMUL: 1 STAGGERED BACK
TO MY FRIENDS. TWENTY
MINUTES LATER I BLACKED
UUT AND THE NEXT THING
I KNEW IT WAS NINE HOURS
LATER AND I WAS FEELING
PUURLY, PUKING MY GUTS
WUT. I COULDN'T ROINEN-
BER SHARING Y MACARONI
WITH THE VOUS OR ANYTHING
CLSE!!
Comments: Passing out
on your back was the most
dangerous thing you did.
You could have gagged or
drowned in your own vom-
it; as it was you covered
yourself. It is much
safer to pass out on yor
side so you can throw
out when you throw-up.
Even sleeping on your
stomach is considered a
good deal safer, Cavers
have been known to wal-
low in their own vomit
for hours with no real
noticeable effecti
Among present D.TC. research
programs are:
Evaluation of the light-
weight drinking glove
in keeping the hand
warm (in progress)
evaluation of effective-
ness of beer coolers in
emergency party situa-
tions (Initiated)
Determination of the pop-
top chain strengths as
related to length and
hanging stresses during
partying (Completed)
Determination of value of
a C.P.C.N. "Caver Party
Communications Network"
being established,
DO YOU know of other re-
search and testing pro-
grams which would be of
interest to the drinking
community? Please let
us know about them. An
informed DTC can then
inform the general mem-
bership of the NSS.

Comments: Look before
you leap, make sure you
know what you're drinking
and how much, For all you
know it could have been
transmission fluid or
worse. Be careful when
you drink, bring your own
and be cautious if you
mooch.

RECENTLY, WHILE AT A
PARTY, I RECICVED A
QUART OF GRAIN ALCOHOL
AS A PRESENT. I MIXED
IT WELL, BUT KNEW I WOULD
NEED CLP I LET A NEW
MEMBER HELP ME TO KILL
IT. UNKNOWN TO ME, THREE
OTHER NEW MEMBERS WERE
ALSO HELPING ME. IT DID
NOT REALLY MATTER AS I
WAS BUSY LATER THAT NIGHT
DRY-HEAVING. I WAS DRAG-
GED OUTSIDE AND LEFT NEXT
TO A TREE AT THE BOTTOM
OF A HILL. WHILE I WAS
STILL FEELING PUURLY, I
WAS BUMPED INTO, I SAW
THAT IT WAS THE NEW ME
BER. HE HAD BEEN ROLLED
DOWN THE HILL IN A SIM-
ILAR CONDITION. DURING

OTHER PEOPLE ALSO FEEL-
LING POORLY.

Comments: Sharing any
drink is a hazard. Either
you run out of drink too
fast or you catch nasty
germs. Keep a watchful
eye on your drink to keep
unauthorized people away.
Finally, being the first
to pass out at a party
can be dangerous if you .
pick the best spot. You -
will find others tend to
