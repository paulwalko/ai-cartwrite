Dead Cat Cave
Dead Cat Cave was discovered last may ridgewalking north-
west of Pembroke, Giles County. Donnie Carter, Jim Eller, John
Mosely and I searched without compass and, because of rain,
without map. We underestimated the terrain and quickly be-
came lost. While wandering, we found a small cave with a tight
entrance drop. It looked mediocre, but we decided to come back
with vertical gear. After several hours we found our way out
of the woods; miles from Donnie's car. We hitched a ride.
We returned the following weekend, having ascertained the
cave's position and newness. We found the cave without dif-
ficulty. Donnie, Jim, and skip whitehurst rappelled into a
70 foot drop and a small room. Bill noerschner found a crawl
at the top of the drop and reported another pit. I rappelled
into the first pit but could find no trace of bill's pit.. we
ascended and rerigged the rope. vonnie and I then descended
about 110 ft.; tight fissure leading to muddy rooms, Claw
marks were everywhere--even in incredible places like over-
head formations. In the lowest part of the cave I came upon
the beast: i bobcat skeleton, we left with several leads
left to us.
in uctober, Jonnie, von vavison and I returned to start
mapping. Donnie and I mapped the first drop while ion checked
the other drop. He found an air hole that accounted for the
flow of air through the cave. He also found a crawlway with
acoustics that magnify the heartbeat of a caver so that it can
be heard at both ends, while we checked the bottom of the
first drop, Don checked leads elsewhere. We were unable to
find any that opened up.
Several weeks later wonnie and I again returned to map.
We finished everything explored previously, but had to leave
two leads unchecked when we came close to our sign-out time.
Unfortunately, Donnie's watch had stopped working in the cave
and our estimate of time was in error. We heard on the radio
that we were already 35 minutes late! A quick phone call
barely diverted the rescue and/or lynching for us.
Donnie had dropped his pack (with vertical gear, lamp,
and tape) in our haste to get out. This forced us to re-
turn to complete the map and check the two leads, Donnie,
Dennis Vaders, and myself returned to finish it. The smell
of rotting cave pack told us that there was little air flow
down deep in the cave, vur two hot leads gave up a total
of twenty more feet. At the top of one of the rooms we found
a tight fissure going in the direction of the crawl at the
bottom of the first drop. No visual connection was made,
but we believe that it does connect here. We left the cave
tired and grubby. No one has been back since.
