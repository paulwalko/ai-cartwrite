FALL/WINTER_
The Tech Treslodyte
1976
V. P. Column
Actually, this isn't a column related in any way, shape
or form to the President's column. This is just a means to
look impressive, make filler and tell the world some of the
more humerous events I experienced as V.. This week I shall
tell you all about my trainee data sheet: it the beginning
of the year when we experience a flux of new members (at least
potentially) a sheet is passed out to these new people. The
answers are, sometimes, humerous.
One of our questions deals with how the new person found
out about the V.P.I. Grotto, most people discovered us through
our posters, but there are exceptions. Une fellow who had been
caving for four years said "Common knowledge". Even more in-
teresting was an 18 year old who had caved with D.C. Grotto
for 6 years who answered "Reputation!"(1 add as a note of
interest that he had let his N.S.S. number expire). Another
person caving for 4 Å¹ years said "It is hard to do anything in
speleology without hearing about the Tech Troglodytes." Per-
haps the most interesting was one that said "wy brother is a
former member; he's taken me down several times since I was 8."
Also on this questionaire is a question "what's the diff-
erence between a duck?". This question was originally used
by Cheryl Jones when she overwhelmed this office and has been
used since to confuse, confound, and amaze peoples. Many
fascinating answers have popped up to this one. Even more
exciting is the look of bewilderment that passes across the
faces of those as they first read the question. Last fall,
though, an interesting event occurred. Two males sitting
together gathered up enough courage to ask me what the heck
the question meant. In my own round-about manner I was able
to explain to them that it was, at the very least, a totally
bull-zip question. They eventually caught on and agreed on
an idiot answer. Une wrote "Motorcycles don't have doors" and
the other put "Motorbikes have no doors". Une girl who was
seated behind them and was thoroughly confused apparently
glanced over their shoulders for she put "Something about a
motorcycle" on her paper. ViP.1. runs on the sonor System
and I, as former Honor Court Investigator and Honor Court
Juror, almost felt like giving her the scate of her life,
going up to her, flashing my I.V, card and explaining to her
the sins of violating our sonor Code, I didn't, but it still
amazes me to think of someone having to peek on a question-
naire like mine. oh well, as someone else put "It's all
Fowl to me!"
