It is not uncommon for list members to identify kindred spirits based on their
public (to the list) postings, and to begin a private, off-list, correspondence. Eventually
you will get to meet your electronic friend in the flesh, but let me warn you, they never
look like your mental image of them. Nonetheless, when I meet e-mail friends, there
is a closeness that you would never have in meeting a stranger.
There are three electronic mailing lists for cavers that I know of. The Caver's Digest is
by far the largest. Although 85% of the list members are in the U.S., the remainder
come from around the globe. There are many NSS big shots that post to this list.
TAG-NET focuses on caving in TAG. OVR-CAVE focuses on the Ohio Valley region,
primarily Kentucky. Later I will give details on how to join each list.
Caver's Digest and TAG-NET actually work slightly differently than my initial
description of e-mail lists. They are distributed in digest format. What this means is
that instead of forwarding each individual message as it arrives, groups of messages
are collected, and forwarded as one long message to all list members every couple of
days. This does not, however, prevent private mail from being sent as often as you
like. Digesting serves two purposes. First, it cuts down on the number of silly
messages that get posted. Someone could type in a multi-page message about a
cave rescue, and someone else could reply to the list with a message like, "Gee. That
was a good report. This would be a very nice message to send privately, but it
certainly does not need to be sent to thousands of cavers around the world. People
tend not to send silly, short messages to a digest. The second reason for digesting is
so that the list moderator, a human, can scan the messages before adding them to the
digest. There is not much censorship, but short, silly messages that are sent can be
thrown away by the moderator, and not be put into the digest that gets sent out. Even
more importantly, the moderators of both Caver's Digest and TAG-NET will delete any
descriptions of how to get to a cave from the version put in the digest. This keeps
nerd cavers (as opposed to caving nerds) from finding our favorite spots. If you do
want to get to a cave that you read about, you can send a private message to the
poster to arrange a trip, if that person is willing. The person's e-mail address will be in
the digest, at the top of their message.
OVR-CAVE is not digested, and does have a lot of silly, short messages. OVR-CAVE
has another interesting feature. The maintainer of that list has set up a procedure to
copy messages between the local CAVE-NET bulletin board systems (BBS's) and the
Internet OVR-CAVE list. BBS's work much like e-mail lists, except that they run on
PC's in people's homes, and the phone line is used to send messages to and from the
host machine. CAVE-NET is a cooperative arrangement among many BBS's where
they send the messages collected at each local BBS to each of the other BBS's.
People can then read the messages generated at other sites, reply to their local
machine, and their reply will be forwarded when the message exchange between
BBS's takes place. The Internet OVR-CAVE list gives people with Internet access a
way to hook into CAVE-NET.
In addition to exchanging messages, both Caver's Digest and TAG-NET have a
number of informational files that you can get sent to you by e-mail. Details of what
files are available, and how to get them sent to you by e-mail will be (electronically)
