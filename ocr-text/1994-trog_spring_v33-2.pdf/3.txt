Editor's Last Word
Well, another Trog has come and gone with all the usual screw-ups, confusion,
and last-minute madness. Thanks to everyone who helped by contributing articles, trip
reports, and even ideas to make this process go more smoothly.
I'd also like to offer a special thanks to all those who promised me articles and
bailed out at the last minute (you know who you are).
Anyway, here's the Trog. Hope you like it. Feel free to compliment me on what
a fine job I've done. You can also offer constructive criticism for the future. Any
outright complaints, however, might just make me angry, and you wouldn't like me
when I'm angry :...
