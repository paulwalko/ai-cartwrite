Caving Trivia
VPI cavers have been exploring such familiar caves as Smokehole, Tawney's,
Newcastle Murder Hole, and Pig Hole for over 50 years!
In order to conserve gas, cavers would ride together to the cave standing in the
back of a farmer's truck.
Many early cavers wore cloth miner's hats while underground. Hard hats were
becoming more popular around 1948, but jumped in popularity in the club when one of
the members required three stitches after a rock fell ten feet onto his head in Pig Hole.
Early "rappels" into Clover Hollow consisted of each caver being lowered on a
bosun seat while one person remained at the top manning the winch. "It was a slow
process, but we never lost anyone" (author of quote unknown).
In the first few years that the club was part of the NSS, National dues were
$1.00 annually and grotto dues were $.50 per quarter.
An Early Caver's Attempt at Poetry
Advice to [?] Spelunker by R.N.S.
So you're going caving?
I'll tell you Bun,
You ought to get yourself prepared
To have a lot of fun.
But I guess you'd better wear a pair
Of old blue dungarees,
And a little extra padding
Will help around the knees.
On top I'd wear a sweatshirt
Or some old dud -
For you never can tell when
You'll see a lot of mud.
I'd wear a pair of real old shoes
And heavy woolen socks,
'Cause it helps to have protection when
You're walking on rough rocks.
Does it sound like pure insanity
Of some Moronic brand?
All the gals, dress that way, too
If they don't look grand!
And I think you'll find we Speleos
Will do our very best
To make the day a happy one
If not a day of rest.
