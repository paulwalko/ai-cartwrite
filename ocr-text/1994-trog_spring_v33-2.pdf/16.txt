Looking around I discovered some elephant tracks. I followed them and they took me
for quite a little ride through some crawls and finally onto a path leading down.
Thinking that this was the way I went back and got Dave.
We came back and followed the path and it led straight to the river. Going
upstream a little bit we discovered that it was warm. We found it! After a few
moments of joy we had to travel back to get the others. Going back we apparently
took the wrong way but we followed it and came out into the breakdown right near the
entrance. That was annoying to find out that it could have taken fifteen minutes to
get to the river instead of an hour and a half but no use crying over spilled milk.
We went down through the familiar breakdown and gathered the others and
took them back to the river. We changed our clothes since it was nice and in the
eighties. I wore boots, knee pads, shorts, shirt, and a helmet. Most others wore the
same. Jerry wore some fashionable Hanes underwear. From here we set off up the
stream to discover its wonders.
A little climbing and we cleared the breakdown and started up stream passage.
Most of it was duck walking or belly swimming. A little ways up the stream we
stopped for a rest and played in the mud. Dave and I built the roaring city of
mudtropolis and Jerry and Mike experimented with mud farting noises (that's right,
don't let the crushing grip of maturity get a hold of you -- Eds). These were created
by sticking your arm up to your shoulder in the mud wall and the suction created some
interesting sounds. We had a real good time here.
After growing tired of mud, we went down the tunnel. There was one little
duck where we had to hold our carbides in a little crack and duck under but otherwise
the passage was mainly walking from here on. Eventually the water started getting a
little deeper and we had to swim. After a while the water swallowed out and a few
boulders blocked the passage. We climbed over them and other side was something
kind of interesting. There was a rope dangling from a hole in the ceiling. It was
horribly annoying not being able to see what wonders lie above us but we had no
choice.
Just past the rope was a little room. Here the river made a ninety degree turn.
There were some real interesting rimstone waterfalls. Some of there rimstone was at
least twenty feet long.
Just past this room the river extended straight for sometime until it ended.
There were a couple of rooms but not many points of interest except the last hundred
feet or so of tunnel. The passage was almost perfectly rectangular and uniform.
There also was a thermometer placed in the mud which read eighty-three degrees.
The end of the river sumped out and this ended our fantastic journey. We went
back changed our clothes and climbed to the surface. I do believe that this cave was
one of the most interesting caves that I have been to. From what I have read about it
and seen there is still so much more to explore.
