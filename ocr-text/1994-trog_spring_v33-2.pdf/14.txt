Clover Hollow 10/09/94
Last October I was present on a trip to Clover Hollow led by Mike® and Hoss for
some rigging practice. Before the trip, we of course stopped at Kroger where I
proceeded to get a Snapple® brand beverage and Mike purchased his traditional six-
pack of Mountain Dew for the impending trip. I do know enough not to bring glass
underground (will wonders never cease! --Eds) so after Mike finished a bottle, I filled it
with Snapple so that I could enjoy this delicious beverage in the inviting comfort of the
cave. I was, however, using a smaller-than-average pack so along with my vertical
gear, the bottle would not fit. I suppose I was the "senior trainee“ on the trip, so
naturally I delegated it to one of the green trainees with an immense pack.
Unbeknownst to me, however, Mike gave the same trainee an empty bottle for extra
water which he proceeded to fill once we were underground.
It was for the most part a standard tourist trip, where we went down the
nuisance drops and the canyon and slid down the Dragon's Tail in pursuit of the
famed Library Room. However, coming off the tail, one of the trainees (not the one I
gave the bottle to decided to jump the last five feet and before anyone could stop
him, he managed to twist his ankle. It wasn't extremely serious but nevertheless we
decided to scratch seeing the Library Room and went to exit the cave through a
couple of crawls so the trainee would put as little weight on his ankle as possible.
Mike and Hoss rigged a special cam system out of a ropewalker which allowed the
trainee to ascent up the canyon (in what other direction would you ascend? --Eds) and
beyond without the use of his injured ankle.
Halfway through the trip, near the beautiful black gypsum flowers, the uninjured
trainee's lamp was not working correctly and it was quickly deduced that the cause
was the muddy cave-water he used to fill the lamp. So he then emptied the bottle
because the water wasn't doing anybody any good; can't drink it and it won't work in
the lamp. A little while later we hit the second nuisance drop and I was quite thirsty. I
asked the trainee for my Snapple (I'm sure you can guess where I'm going with this)
and after taking a large swig, I immediately noticed a certain grittiness on my teeth.
After pondering this for about three milliseconds, the realization of what I'd actually
done hit me like a Peterbilt. He'd emptied the wrong bottle! | spewed out a mouthful
of dirty, cow-pie runoff, pesticide-ridden, field-drainage, giardia-infested, and full of all
kinds of other nasty things that I don't even want to start guessing as to their origin,
cave-water in the closest direction where nobody was standing.
To everyone else it was quite humorous but from then on, I always carry my
own stuff (so it can learn! --Eds). I just wish I could have learned it without enduring a
mouth full of silt. By the time we reached the entrance pit at five o'clock in the
morning we were all dog-tired for we did 14 hours of caving and didn't even get to see
Old Man Cartwright.
