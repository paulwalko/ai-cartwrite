A note about passwords. To maintain privacy on your account, and prevent
unauthorized access, the password should be something that others cannot
guess. Your name or PID are particularly bad choices. Computer security
people even recommend against anything that is a word in a dictionary.
STEP 5: JOIN A LIST!
In all cases, a list is joined by sending an e-mail message to a special account
that manages the list. This is not the account to which you will send messages
destined for list distribution, I'll give you that account, too.
Exactly how you send and receive mail depends upon the software that you are
using. Get someone with experience to help you, or go to the Blacksburg
Public Library, where the staff can give assistance.
A. Caver's Digest Send a message to listproc@speleology.cs.yale.edu
The message should be only one line: subscribe cavers-digest your name
For instance, I sent the message subscribe cavers-digest jerry shapiro
You will get a message back asking you to send a brief introduction of yourself
to the list, along with information about the files associated with the list and how
to get them, and general information about the list. You will also get a series of
messages that list every topic ever posted to Caver's Digest. This can be a
useful reference, as you can have the old messages sent to you.
If you want to post a message to the list, send it to
cavers@speleology.cs.yale.edu If you have any problems with the list, send
a message to Robert Hubley at cavers-request@speleology.cs.yale.edu
B. TAG-NET Send a message to tag-net-request@netcom.com The
message should be two lines:
subscribe tag-net
help
You will get back an informational message about the list and associated files
and how to get them. You will need to post an introduction of yourself to the
list before you are fully joined.
Messages for list distribution are sent to tag-net@netcom.com
Problems? Send e-mail to Jeff Dilcher at owner-tag-net@netcom.com
C. OVR-CAVE Send a message to listserv@ukcc.uky.edu
The message should be one line: sub ovr-cave your name
For instance, I sent the message sub ovr-cave jerry shapiro
To
Fot.
