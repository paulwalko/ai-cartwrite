We'll Know Where to Find Your Body
It was the first really beautiful day of spring, and I had just finished practicing
top belay at the quarry. Laden with rope, backpack, and cable ladder, I prepared to
rappel. Allison, Steve Wells, Bob Cosby, and Sarah Ludeke were all going to have to
take the sucker's way down (on foot), since none of them had carried up their
rappelling device. There wasn't anyone down at the bottom to give a belay, but I
decided to go anyway. "Just don't do a speed rappel," advised Steve. "If you go down
slowly, you shouldn't have any problem. And if you do screw-up, we'll know where to
find your body... at the bottom of the rope!" He smiled, checked my eight and seat,
and away I went.

Just fifteen or so feet down was a little ledge, over which a pad had been
rigged. As I approached the ledge, I noticed that the rope was tangled with the cord
securing the rope pad. I slowly descended the next two feet, until my feet were on the
lip of the ledge, whereupon I discovered that the rope was under the pad. With my
butt hanging over forty feet of air, I was going to have to untangle this mess. The
tangle was to my right, on the side of my brake hand, and I couldn't reach it with my
left. My first thought was to get some legs wraps, so that I could let go of the rope
with my right hand, but (duh) since the rope was under the pad, that was not an
option. The ol' adrenal gland kicked in as I remembered Steve's parting words.
Fortunately, I had decided to imitate the practice I had observed in more
experienced cavers of descending with climbing gear in place. Thad the cord for my
top knot girth hitched around my seat, with the end tucked into my pants. I pulled the
end out, and only then realized that I was going to have to tie on with one hand, my
left. "We'll know where to find your body ..." echoed again through my mind; the
adrenaline rate kicked up a few more notches.
The end of the story is uneventful. I was able to tie a Prussik with my left hand,
while my brake hand remained on the rope. Once I had sat down on the Prussik,
untangling the rope, untying the Prussik left handed (pushed it down once I was on
the eight), and resuming my descent took only a couple of seconds. It was about an
hour, though, before the adrenaline jitters subsided.
Like any experience, what doesn't kill you makes you smarter (or so they claim,
though I can name a few cavers who's very lives prove the exceptions -- Eds). What
did I learn from this?
1) Always have your ascending gear attached to your seat when
rappelling. You might not be able to fish it from your pack when you need it,
and even if you can, you may not have the time.
2) You must be able to attach your ascender with your off hand only.
Easy if you have a mechanical ascender. Very do-able with a Prussik. Can
you tie a helical one handed? Maybe, but whatever your method, practice at a
rope session before your life is at risk.
