sent to you when you join these lists, but to give you an idea of what's available,
here's a partial list: equipment vendors, prices, and phone numbers; Caving Online,
an electronic caver's magazine; cave descriptions; grotto addresses; and rescue
reports.
What will this cost? You can try it out for free! Application for a PID costs
nothing, and the Blacksburg Public Library, as part of the Blacksburg Electronic Village
(BEV) project, has four computers that you can use for free to read and send e-mail.
If you want to do this at home, the cost depends upon where you are and your
relationship to VT.
If you are a student, faculty, or staff on-campus, your connection will usually be
easy. Most simply need a cable that runs from the computer to the ROLM phone.
(For faculty and staff there is also a $5 monthly data fee, billable to your phone
account. Talk to your department's network coordinator.) You access the Internet
through the same network that processes your phone calls. The bookstore has the
cable that you'll need. I'm not sure of the price, but it's not much. You do not need a
modem.
Some campus offices and East Payne residence hall have Ethernet wiring
installed. Ethernet is a high speed local network that connects to the campus
computers. You will need a special card and cable, (see the description for
apartments with Ethernet below). Students in East Payne will need to get an IP
address (Internet address) and request activation of the Ethernet port from the
Telecommunications office in 128 Burruss. Students must have a PID before
requesting these services. An application for a PID form is reproduced at the end of
this article. There is no additional fee. Faculty and staff should contact their
departmental network coordinator.
If you are off campus you will probably need to access the campus computer
network over the phone line. To do this, you need a device, a modem, that allows
your computer to communicate over the phone line. Modems can be either boxes that
you connect to your computer and phone, or cards that go inside your computer, and
are connected to the phone. The cost depends upon how fast the modem can
transmit information, called the baud rate. A reasonably fast modem, 9600 baud, can
be purchased for $40 to $70 dollars. Slower modems, 2400 baud, do not cost much
less, but if you are not affiliated with the university, your cost of connection will be
less. For best results, the BEV recommends spending $125-$200 for a V.32bis
modem that runs at 14,400 baud. The BeV technical folks strongly recommend
against purchasing internal modems of any kind, despite the lower cost. They
encounter many problems getting internal modems to work properly.
Off campus students, faculty, or staff using a modem can use the Eris software
to send and receive e-mail and access a limited set of other services without paying a
network access fee. Those not affiliated with VT will need to subscribe to the
Blacksburg Electronic Village (details later). Your access fee will be $5 per month for
a modem at 2400 baud, $8.60 a month for faster modems. Of course you could use
