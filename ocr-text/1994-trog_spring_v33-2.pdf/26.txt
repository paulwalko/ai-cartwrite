To summarize things, in less time than it took the cave to form (but not by
much -- Eds), we surveyed the cave with me reading Brunton. I almost did a decent
job of it. I say "almost“ in the sense that when we were done and Steve fed the data
into SMAPS, the accuracy of my survey had the cave almost on the correct planet.
Nevertheless, I must say that I definitely learned a lot about reading Brunton on this
trip. I feel that reading Brunton would have been quite easy if:
• I could float in air
• My head were 2 inches thick
• I did not need light to see
• 1 did not need to ever breathe

Bad Brunton experiences aside, "Condom Cave" is worth mentioning because it
is a really nice little cave. The cave entrance is just a few feet off a side road of
Route 100 in Pearisburg. The first part of the cave is a little canyon. After going
through this, a down climb to the left leads to a small passage with some real nice
formations. A down climb to the right leads to a larger room, which can also be
accessed through a crawl in the middle. The real beauty of this cave lies up a lead on
the left side of this large room. Going up this lead requires climbing up a narrow,
awkward chimney climb. However, at the top of this climb are several rooms full of
beautiful formations. In fact, one of the neat things about this cave is that much of it is
located behind effective "nerd filters", that aren't too challenging for most cavers. As
this cave is just off a roadside in Pearisburg, the cave would probably not be nearly as
pretty without these “filters".
That's a brief description of the cave. The cave's really pretty, and the average
person could likely see it all in less than a half hour. More importantly, the cave is
really clean. Therefore, “Condom Cave“ would be a really nice diversion to stop at the
next time you're passing through Pearisburg. It's quick to see, quite pretty, and you
don't even need to change into your cave clothes. If you're interested in seeing the
cave, Steve Wells, Bryce Bolton, Allison Dineen, or myself can provide directions.
