Adventures in Non-Caving
You see, caving is fun. This is why so many times I have entered a Friday
night meeting (exhausted) with no intention of plunging underground in the next couple
of days, but have left (excited) committed to a Sunday trip. On these occasions 1
burst out of the stuffy Smyth lecture room with only two events between me and the
cave trip: a work-filled Saturday AND ... an adventure-filled route getting to the cave.
You are about to embark on my very first expedition on the way to New River
Cave, and maybe some other particularly memorable pre-caving fiascos.
The journey starts in the Derring parking lot early last fall. "It's so late! They
must have left us."
"No, we haven't even approached caver-standard time. We have about fifteen
more minutes yet.â€œ
So, there are ten brand new trainees sitting sleepy-eyed, bags packed, and
anxious. Slowly, yawning people whom none of us know drive up and begin planning
who goes where first. One hungry party goes to Kroger, one hungry party goes to
Hardee's, another drives to "sign-out" and another bolts to 7-11 for batteries they've
meant to buy for weeks now. Now we have four task-forces loose in Blacksburg.
The sign-out team arrives at their destination and begins to attack task #1 -
dumping all the spent carbide out of the lamps and figuring out how many lamps and
helmets we need. This sort of high math with a hangover can baffle even the most
skilled caver. Task #2 - who is on the trip, what are their names and phone numbers,
and oh yeah, where are we going again?
Meanwhile, the eaters become fed and at least one person remembers what it
was they forgot at home. Then someone in their Hardee's biscuit-bliss wonders,
"Aren't we supposed to wait for the others at Kroger before we head out to the river?"
This constitutes the need to stand in the Kroger parking lot for at least 25 minutes just
in case the others come to find them there.
As the 7-11 crew reaffirms their belief that batteries can be a rip-off at a
convenience store, one of the club members remembers, "Hey, don't all these 16
trainees need to sign the New River waivers?" Great, another mission is at hand. Of
course, first a gasoline fill-up, then comes the search for the waivers ....
Time lapsed from Derring: Two hours, thirty minutes. Finally! We are parked
at the river and the cave area is in sight! The horde of trainees are already scooting
up the hill -- but wait, the members still need to get suited up. That will only take a
minute, right?
This high adventure morning was that of my first cave trip. It took three hours
to begin the ascent to the cave and three hours to get to the waterfall inside. I hope
everyone else had as much fun on the Blacksburg tour as I did!
