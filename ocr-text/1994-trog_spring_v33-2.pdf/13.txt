There were two work weekends this April at the Penley farm. See A Day at
the Fenceposts for more details.
Mike Fiore escaped from Chapel Hill for a brief weekend visit to Blacksburg and
was seen around town with "old friends".
The Easter Beer Hunt and its ensuing sauna party broke the monotony of daily
living for some. While the rest of us searched for beers the old-fashioned way, Craig
Ferguson foraged with a rented metal detector. Cheating? Perhaps, but most of us
found the silly-assed, pleased-with-himself grin on his face amusing enough to let the
issue slide. A few trainees even took the plunge (literally!) and did the sauna/river/fire
routine.
For the first time in a few years picnic took place in the upper field. The
weather was nicer than it had been for years, so naturally more people than usual
went caving.
Dave Colatosti, Sandy Knapp, and Bob Simonds biked out this year. For her
efforts, Sandy came down with an unpleasant virus and went to bed early Saturday
night. Nathan Sharp tried to bike back to B'burg on Saturday, but returned to the
Penley farm after realizing he'd biked for an hour in the wrong direction.
Molly Thompson appeared Saturday morning with coffee and coffeecakes for
those milling about the fire. She also provided some lunch for very grateful people on
the work crews (one crew demolished cherry trees while the other mended fences).
The fire roared Saturday night with the fruits of one of the work crew's labor.
Unfortunately, erratic winds made standing near the fire difficult. Many of us have the
burn holes in our sweatshirts to prove it. And of course, what would picnic be without
firecrackers, carbide bombs and potato launchers?
Joey Fagan showed up at 2:00 Sunday morning. I'm told he's always late, but
this is ridiculous! Eight hours later folks started trickling home, leaving the old farts to
finish a keg. Why is it that they always out-party the younger crowd?
Thanks to Jen Savage for her efforts towards picnic and t-shirts.
That's the news from Blacksburg, where all the women are muddy, all the men
are obscene, and all the children are raving maniacs.
