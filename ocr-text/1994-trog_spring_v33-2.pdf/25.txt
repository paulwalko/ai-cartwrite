Deep in the Caverns of my Nostrils
A Trip Report to Condom Cave
It's late, I should be asleep. Even the radio is telling me so - If you listen to
96.3 FM late enough, a show called "Metal Shop“ comes on, which sounds like what
would happen were you to stick your ear next to a large Harley-Davidson motorcycle
with significant muffler problems, owned by a guy named Rex, and rev it up to the
operating speed of most military aircraft. If anything, this is an understatement.
So since my brain is currently resonating, and I can't sleep, I thought I'd tell y'all
about what Steve Wells and myself did one day during spring break, while attempting
to alleviate boredom, as well as any chance of using spring break to catch up in our
studies. Namely, we surveyed "Condom Cave", in Pearisburg, VA.
"Condom Cave" was affectionately named by Bryce Bolton and Allison Dineen,
when they came across this cave while hiking, a little over a year ago. Were they, or
were they not using one at the time? -- We don't know. The official GCCS name of
Condom Cave is something like "Virginia Roadside Cliff Cave #317,269", but Condom
Cave sounds better, don't you think?
Anyway, the name's not important - the cave is. And that leads to our trip.
This started out smoothly. Getting up somewhere slightly before the "crack of noon", i
got my things together, signed us out (noting that the cave was in Pembroke - per
Steve's instructions), and got Steve. About 40 minutes later, as we rolled into
Pearisburg, Steve realized that the cave was really in Pearisburg (incredible leap of
intellect on Steve's part -- Eds).
This turned out to be one of the very minor mistakes on the trip, because this
trip was also my first time reading Brunton underground. I thought I would not have
too hard a time reading Brunton. I practiced in my apartment, even with the lights off.
So, reading Brunton underground couldn't be much different, right?
Well, those of you who know the answer to this question can skip this
paragraph. Those of you who don't should glance at the typical dialogue Steve and
myself kept going during the trip:
Dave:
"Umm.....Uhh.... Err...." (find station in compass mirror)....(hold
breath).... (align compass)... (gasp for air like a potential drowning
victim)... (lose station in compass mirror)... "Umm... Uhh..." (get wonderful
view of inside of nostrils in compass mirror)...(realize nostrils are
blocking view of station in compass mirror)...(attempt to move head to
view station)....(get frustrated) “AARRRGGGHHHH!!!!!" (have now
fogged-up compass mirror) ... "AAARRRGGGHHH!!!!!" (wait for
compass mirror to clear)...(align compass) .... "Aha! I got it! Inclination :
-45 degrees."
"Uh, Dave, that can't be right. This is a flat shot."
"*&^%%$#@()&^%$#*&^%!!!!!!"
