CAVING THE INTERNET
If you've been above ground much at all in the last few years, you've heard the
buzzwords: cyberspace; information superhighway; the Internet. So why should
cavers care to read more about this in the Trog? Well, how would you like to have a
daily conversation with cavers from around the world? At any time of day or night. To
have hundreds of caver-lives worth of experience to draw on, or just to share some
pleasant time with. The world of electronic communication can make this possible, and
you don't need to know much about computers, or even own one, to make it happen.
First off, what is the Internet (or cyberspace)? It is a group of computers
connected by phone, satellite, and dedicated transmission lines so that they can pass
information to one another. There are thousands of computers on the Internet, in
every corner of the world, including computers at VT that you can access! The
information superhighway is a project to provide better lines connecting these
computers in the U.S. You don't need to know a thing about how the computers are
connected, or how they find one another. It's been done for you.
So, how do you "talks to other cavers using the Internet? One of the easiest
features of the Internet to use is electronic mail, or e-mail. Much like postal service
mail, electronic mail allows you to send a message to someone if you know their
address. The difference is that electronic mail can be anywhere in the world in a
matter of seconds. And the addresses look different. Mine, for example, is
gshapiro @vt.edu . Bob Cosby is bob@vt.edu . The part after the @ is the computer
that handles our mail. Everyone on the same computer has the same thing after the
@ , just like everyone in a family has the same last name. The part before the @ is a
personal identification, or PID. Everyone at vt.edu has a unique PID. Later I'll tell you
how you can get a PID and an e-mail account.
At least initially, you will not communicate directly with other cavers, but
indirectly via an electronic mailing list. E-mail lists work like this: You send your
message(s), if you have any, to the home address for the list. The computer at the
home address then forwards your message to every other member of the list. When
they read your message they can either send a reply to the list's home address, in
which case the reply will also be forwarded to every member of the list, including you,
or they can send a private reply directly to your e-mail address. Similarly, once you
join a list, you can reply to forwarded messages either directly (privately) to the
sender, or to the list address, in which case every other list member will see your
reply.
For example, as an experiment | posted to the Caver's Digest list a question
about belay technique. There were 13 replies to the list, and one person replied to me
privately, (shy, I guess). Eight of the respondents were in the USA, two each from
Australia and the UK, one from Canada, and one from Brazil. Since my dad was
going to Australia, I sent a private mail to one of the Aussie respondents, asking about
restaurants in Melbourne. He gave some advice, and asked me to have my dad give
him a call. Tons of info, and a new friend Down Under!
