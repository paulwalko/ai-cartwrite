How Not to Transport A Bike
To further explain what happened when Steve Wells helped me transport my
motorcycle from Golfview to Mr. Zion ....
It was a rainy, cold Blacksburg evening (surprise). Since my bike wouldn't start,
Steve offered to assist me by loading the Kawasaki into his less-than-reliable Dodge
van. My chromed beauty is equipped with an engine guard which had to be removed
before the bike would fit. Of course, we didn't realize this until I was on the bike, on a
ramp, unable to safely go backward. After about an hour of balancing the motorcycle
and propping the door of the van open, we managed to squeeze my baby into the
luxury mobile. Steve did a great job of disassembling all of the necessary parts, with
the help of Spot's tools.
Once we embarked on our journey, some readjusting of the bike was necessary
as it was pushing on the back doors, and I had little faith that they would hold. In
order to scooch the bike forward, Steve slammed on the brakes. By the way, we
didn't tie it down because it seemed pretty balanced with me on it. It was a bit more
stable lying on top of me, but I thought it would be a neat idea for Steve to lift the
#@*ing monstrosity off of me. Finally, we drove past Kroger and really felt we would
be at Nancy's in no time. I had a take-home final still to do that evening, and was
getting a little concerned about time.
Needless to say, when I heard a strange sound I asked Steve if it was the
transmission. "No," he reassured me, "we're running out of gas." As he performed a
quick u-ey in the middle of Glade, our attempt to reach the gas station proved to truly
be in vain. The gears locked. Steve pounded and banged for a good while (on Jen or
the bike? -- Eds), but they were more stuck than ever before. He fixed them after 20
minutes or so, and decided we should walk to the gas station down the road. The gas
Steve bought would have benefitted us if it had been poured into the carburetor;
however, neither of us thought of that. We had blocked someone's driveway during
these events, so I insisted on drifting the van back. We even managed to screw this
up. With one side-view mirror less, an injured tree and a brief time of severely
obstructed traffic, we moved the Dodge. I am still amazed that no one helped us push
the white beast. We tried a variety of methods to get it off of the curb it was stuck on,
pushing separately and together. The together was quite a sight. Steve and I would
push then Steve would race to the driver seat, jump in, and steer.
Finally, some good ol' boys stopped and gave us a lift back to the gas station.
Steve called Spot (Mr. Rescue) and Ali to come help us. Naturally, even the phone
was screwed up, so really he phoned twice. We made it to Mt. Zion in a cool 4 and a
half hours.
Steve and I had a fun time since neither of us got mad at our uncanny bad
luck. He has helped me with my bike since day one, including purchasing it. So,
thank you pal for your time, muscle, and good-nature. Also, thank you Spot and Ali
for heading out to lend us a hand!
