But wait! There's more:
Mike's Bug Experiment at Tawneys Just After Some Minor Winter Flooding:
Somehow, after Mike put off an experiment until the last minute, he found four
people who felt sorry enough for him to help him out. "You'll get to learn how to make
a dry-suit," he offered. I don't think any of us realized that this venture was to mean
one of the most interesting pre-caving experiences ever.
Our first destination was a "quick" stop at Kroger for some trash bags. Well,
then the shopping list lengthened to rubber gloves, a Kroger sub sandwich, cheese
bread, caramels, duct tape, and trash bags. Of course we wanted the cheapest, most
durable dry suit material! So we each grabbed a different brand, compared non-
comparable measurements and bag strengths, and ultimately decided on whichever
brand had the best picture on the box. This method was repeated for the gloves - are
two hundred grippers all that much better than one hundred or none at all? We were
a marketer's dream.
Next, the most challenging part of the trip was accomplished in the comfort of
Jim's warm house - the dry-suit construction. We jumped into and out of trash bags
for the next hour and a half.
"Can you snip this piece here?"
"Only if you tape me here."
"No, you'll have to tape yourself there."
"Where the hell did the scissors go? I just had them ...."
And on and on. It should be noted here that my dry suit is the only one that
didn't and still hasn't leaked (of course, my suit never touched the water, either).
Pshew, there have really been some extended pre-caving trips. Tired yet? Me
neither, but I do have a point. I am learning about many prided VPI Club traditions
that are favorable and essential for the caving I'd like to do. Some of these include
high safety standards, in- and around-cave conservation, positive landowner relations,
training new cavers, being on-call for rescues, enjoying caves, and many others. On
the other hand, there are some prided club traditions I can't figure out. One of these,
of course, is the caver-standard time/waste-the-whole-day-assing-around phenomenon.
Next time you find that you've spent the whole day planning to go caving, maybe you'll
reflect and find that the pre-cave experience is actually one of your favorite parts of
caving. Or maybe you'll resolve to dump your lamp tonight and fill your car up the day
before your next trip.
