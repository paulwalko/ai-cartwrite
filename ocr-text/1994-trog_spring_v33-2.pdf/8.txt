President (or is it Vice) Column
Well this semester has been pretty good as far as new members coming up.
Congrats to all the new people these last couple of weeks. The quarry out at Jim's
has been going pretty good for a temporary replacement for the bridge, but hopefully
we will talk to the university soon about getting the bridge back.
Not very much caving going on this semester it seems. We need a few more
people to go more often. All you new members will hopefully be able to help out next
year to get lots of people underground. We still need people to help out on different
committees. Road clean-up, Programs, and Publicity to name a few. Need more
people to help out on conservation trips and landowner work days.
Banquet was pretty good this year although few trainees were there; hopefully I
will see all of you out at Picnic and OTR next year. Remember, things happen in
Blacksburg all summer also. I expect to see some of you at Float Trip on Memorial
Day Weekend. Hope everyone's exams go well and enjoy caving and parting!!!
