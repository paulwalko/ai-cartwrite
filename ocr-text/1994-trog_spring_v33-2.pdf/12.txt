Heard it throught the Grapevine
Picture if you will a friendly college town. It's winter, a time for romping in the
snow, skiing, and other seasonal fun.
Now look closer. Winter ice hangs heavily on trees, branches are down and
scattered everywhere. The town is dark. Some women are washing their hair with
bottled water in a sink by candlelight. Others are calling friends frantically to see who
has power, or water, or maybe both. Smelly people dressing in fancy clothes ....
You have just entered the Blacksburg Zone ...,
And so it was for Banquet this year. Winter tried to get the best of the cave
club, but we persevered. Aren't we used to being dirty and gross? Though weather
conditions kept a few out-of-towners away, most locals managed to show up. I'm sure
there were some disappointed males when Natalie Serbu didn't arrive.
Where there's banquet, there's awards. Mike Moore received the Brain Bucket
award for his hand-rappel at the Gorge, and Glen Davis was elected "Armchair Caver"
complete with a flashlight-laden lawn chair. Cecile James won't have any more
excuses for missing a Mexico trip -- she received jumper cables to keep the ol' kicker
in action. Sandy Knapp proved her worth as an International Traveler, and the toilet
paper and bucket should assist her next time she's looking for "puppies." Let's not
forget "Our Favorite Coupleâ€œ (and an odd one, at that): Richard Cobb, Pete Sauvigne,
and Jim Denton. Trainee of the Year was shared by Mike Mirro and Angie Felty,
neither of whom bothered to show up.
Despite non-operational bathrooms in Squires (though some of us used them
anyway), it was a nice evening. The bar was stocked and nobody got food poisoning.
Thanks to Alison Williams for making all the arrangements.
This winter Alan Schick offered to "buy the cow" as he slipped a diamond ring
on Shannon Burcham's finger. Is this guy a romantic or what? See Upcoming
Events for the post-nuptual party.
Once again, Ko Takamizawa and his lovely wife Joan Johnson are living in
separate states. Ko started a new job in Boston, and Joan stayed in New York.
Perhaps abstinence makes the heart grow fonder ....
The club added a some new voting trainees to the collection. Jen Savage,
Mike Mirro, Bill Penhallegon, Sara Ludeke, and Jerry Shapiro joined the ranks of
members, which they may or may not admit to later in life. Congrats to all five for
passing Bob Cosby's grueling tests which included drinking beer and straddling his
staircase.
Election time came and went with minimal fuss. Some say it was the fastest
election they'd witnessed. Bob Cosby is now President/Vice President (which seems
like twice as much work, but he promises to work half as hard), Alison Williams is
Secretary, and Leroy Burch is (still) Treasurer until Bill Steier returns to take over.
Fond farewell to former officers Dave Warren and Steve Wells.
