A Little Bit of History
This year marks the 51st year the VPI Cave Club has existed. In honor of this
most auspicious occasion, we stole some interesting tidbits from the Tech Troglodyte's
25th Anniversary Issue. The article "A True Historie" was submitted by Mike Frieders
and Bob Barlow in 1968. Be warned, however, that "many discrepancies may be
noticed between facts in this history and later articles. But VPI cavers being more
prone to caving than journalism have left unfortunate holes in our early records which
we have yet to fully explore." I would guess that 26 years later, there is still much to
discover about the early years of the club.
"It all began then, when Tommy Watts, already an NSS member, and Ralph
Hoss, another student caver, drummed up interest among a few others to affiliate
VPI's cavers with the National Speleological Society. Watts and Hoss, along with
George Crabb, acted through Dr. Holden and NSS members to bring VPI to the
attention of the National Speleological Society. As a result, a national meeting of the
NSS was held at VPI on 5 and 5 September, 1942. At this meeting, the VPI cavers
were affiliated with the NSS, and became the first Student Grotto of the Society."
"The VPI Grotto swung into the swinging sixties with a new constitution,
adopted in May 1961, which contained the controversial amendments dealing with a
trip leader classification system. The new constitution divided all club members into
groups of horizontal or vertical cavers, and leaders into groups "A" or "B" according to
their abilities."
"In February of 1962 the VPI Grotto again published a newsletter called the
Tech Troglodyte which was to be published each quarter, but like all other caving
journals was published when there was enough to put in it. The first "Trogs" were
practically written, edited, and published by Gregg Harland alone."
"VPI's rise in national prestige was confirmed in 1963 when the VPI Grotto
hosted the annual convention of the NSS at Mountain Lake, near Tech."
"In 1963 the VPI Grotto established itself as the undisputed "World's Most
Active Caving Organizationâ€œ with an average of four trips per week and between two
and three thousand hours underground per quarter. Most of the growth and added
caving was probably a direct result of the trainee system incorporated into the club in
1961 to teach prospective members the basics of caving, safety, and conservation."
"Probably the most significant event in the grotto's history took place in 1965
when the constitution was again revised to do away with the leadership code. This
was followed by an overall increase in the caving activities of the grotto, due to the
fact that "qualified" trip leaders had been few, and as a result, the trips had been
limited. It was found that the added experience gained by the members in the course
of increased caving more than outweighed the benefits of the leadership in making all
the members more safety conscious."
