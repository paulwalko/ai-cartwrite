you have a PID, you can use those machines. This would provide a free way
to see if you like e-mail. Otherwise, you will need the appropriate hardware for
your location, as discussed previously.
STEP 3: GET SOFTWARE (OPTIONAL!)
If you decide to use the Blacksburg Public Library terminals, the software that
you will need is already there, installed on those machines. If you decided to
work at home, read on.
A. BEV software If you are not a VT student, faculty or staff, or if you use the
Ethernet, this is what you will need. You may want it anyway, even if you don't
need it, due to the gopher feature, (next paragraph). BEV software is available
from the BEV office; get it when you apply for a PID. You will need to install it
on your computer, and customize some settings. The BEV office has
instructions. If you have installed software before, it shouldn't be too bad, but
don't hold me to that.
In addition to e-mail, the BEV software has a feature called gopher which allows
you to search for and access information from any other computer in the world
which also has gopher. It is not necessary to use this for e-mail lists, so I will
only say two words about it: is cool.
B. Eris software This software allows VT students, faculty and staff to access e-
mail from home, via a modem, at no charge. It does not work with Ethernet.
Unlike access to most university network services from off campus, which
requires a modem pool account (not free), Eris has a separate phone number
for access and does not require a modem pool account.
On-campus cavers can also use Eris. It is easier to use than the BEV software,
but does not have gopher. You can get both types of software, if you wish, as
Eris has a couple of things that BEV does not (later).
Eris software is available from either the AJ or Hillcrest computer labs. Bring in
a.formatted, hi-density, 3.5" diskette. You will get a diskette with the Eris
software and some documentation.
Eris services, in addition to e-mail, include an on-line version of USA Today,
and a calendar of university events.
STEP 4: LOG ON THE FIRST TIME
Everybody will need to set up the software on their computer. The
documentation should help; an experienced friend would really help.
You will also need to change the password that you gave when you signed up.
(You will get a message that your password is expired.) The information packet
that you receive will tell you how to do this.
