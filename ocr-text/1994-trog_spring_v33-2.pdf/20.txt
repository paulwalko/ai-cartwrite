the public terminals in the Blacksburg Library for free. Your PID can be obtained from
BEV, or at the B'burg library, without paying the modem access charges.
A few people may live in places that access the Internet via a local network,
called an Ethernet. Ethernet access is available from Tech Terrace, Jefferson
Apartments, parts of Foxridge, and The Chase. Ethernet provides a much faster
connection than a modem, but you will need a 10-BaseT Ethernet card for your
computer, which costs more than a modem: at least $60, typically $100; check at the
bookstore. You will also need a cable from your computer to the Ethernet jack,
another $15. In addition, there is a $5 a month Ethernet fee to the university. Bell
Atlantic owns the Ethernet off campus, and are currently waiving charges, but if they
do decide to charge, it will likely be $15-20 per month. You will need to call Bell
Atlantic to activate your Ethernet wall plug.
OK, are you interested? Well then, here's what you need to do. I advise
finding someone who has set up a system like you'll be using, and getting them to
help you. There are also phone numbers to call for assistance in the documentation
that you'll get with your software.
STEP 1: GET A PID
There is no difference between a VT PID and a BEV PID. If you have one, you
don't need the other. If you already have a computer account with Internet
access, you don't need a PID; skip to step 5: join a list.
Everyone must read and agree to the “Acceptable Use of Information Systems
at Virginia Tech“ statement before a PID will be issued. This document is
reproduced at the end of this article.
A. VT students, faculty, staff: Students will need to go to one of the computer
labs on campus, and hand in the APPLICATION FOR A PID, reproduced at the
end of this article. Faculty and staff can mail their PID application to PID
Registration, Campus Box 0214.
B. Not affiliated with VT: You will need to apply for a PID at the Blacksburg
Electronic Village office. The form is reproduced at the end of this article. The
BEV office is located in the lobby of the Information Systems Building, 1700
Pratt Drive (in the Corporate Research Center, near the entrance to the Virginia
Tech Airport). The office is open from 8 a.m.-1:00 p.m. every Tuesday, 9 a.m.-
1 p.m. every Thursday, and from 3-5:00 p.m. every Wednesday. The phone is
231-4786. You will need to bring a picture ID with you. Allow two weeks for
processing if you are getting accounts set up to access the Internet from at
home.
STEP 2: GET HARDWARE (OPTIONAL!)
As part of the Blacksburg Electronic Village project, the Blacksburg Public
Library has four computers that you can use to read and send e-mail. Once
