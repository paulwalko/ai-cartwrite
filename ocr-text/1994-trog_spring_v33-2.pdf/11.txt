A Day at the Fenceposts
This is a trip report. This particular trip was not to a cave, but to the Newberry's
clean-up on April 9. As most everyone knows, every year we go out to the Penley
farm and help out with some work.
Last Saturday was one of several of these work days this year. At around ten-
thirty in the morning, Bob Cosby and I arrived at the Newberry's field and were
greeted by Dave Shantz, Dave Cinsavich, Doug Perkins, and Walt Pirie. Our job for
the day; fences. Everyone got to work (amazingly enough, with little piddle time)
pulling down a section of old fence, digging new holes, and then replacing rotten posts
with spanking new ones. Lawrence Britt and Bob and Jean Simonds also arrived for
the festivities. A good time was had by all as we worked and the "old farts"
exchanged stories.
One particular favorite was when someone brought up, "Remember when we
built this fence?" (Pretty scary, huh?). Everyone laughed a little and remembered
how Buddy out-worked, out-hollered, out-dug, and basically out-did everyone, yet
never pushed anyone over their limit and everyone had a good time. I also recall
something of a quote about using honeylocust beams to build the fence instead of the
stronger black locust, to which Buddy replied, "As long as it lasts longer than I do then
it's just what I want.â€œ
All in all it was a good day and we replaced fourteen fence posts.
A note to the younger generation who was highly in the minority at the event. I
think it would be a good thing if the participation was a little better. Not only is it a
good cause (especially if you will be attending picnic), but it is a lot of fun too. Who
knows, if you are willing to work and listen too, you may just learn something about
fixing fences or about life itself. See you at the fence line!
