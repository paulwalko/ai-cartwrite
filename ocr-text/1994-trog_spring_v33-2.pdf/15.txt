Trip to Warm River
It all started one Saturday morning as do many cave trips. A small group of us
gathered together at signout to decide where to go. The group consisted of Dave
Colatosti, Amy Stirgwolt, Jerry Shapiro, Mike Lang, Eileen O'Malley, and myself.
There was a debate as to whether to go vertical or horizontal. Eventually we decided
Murder Hole was the place to go.
We piled into the cars and drove to towards the cave. We arrived at the house
to ask permission and an interesting event happened. We pulled up and watched Mr.
Sizer run into the house (wouldn't you run if you saw this group? -- Eds). When we
got to the door there was a sign saying to be quiet because some was sleeping. We
waited a little bit and decided then to go to Jim's to figure out what to do next.
At arrival to Jim's, Amy related to us her idea to go to Warm River Cave. It
was agreed upon. After all the land owner relations and pre-trip necessities were
taken care of we drove off to the cave.
After an hour or so of driving we came to the driveway of the farm of the cave.
Dave lead the way in his probe and Jerry and I followed in his pickup. Unfortunately
Jerry and I got stuck on the ice in the driveway and started sliding back. It took the
combined effort of everybody pushing and adding weight to the truck in order to get it
up the hill. But at last a cave.
We changed in to our caving clothes and prepared ourselves for the
underworld. The entrance to the pit was a decent sized crack-like pit. We rigged a
hand line and arm rapelled down. The entrance room was very interesting. It was full
of these odd shaped ice formations. They were shaped kind of like baseball bats with
the thin end down. The room itself was fairly large. It was apparently the top of a
large breakdown pile.
So down we went, through all sorts of breakdown nasties. There was a twenty
foot drop and some neat little holes and a real lot of bats. Eventually we came to a
point where we couldn't go down anymore. We began poking around trying all sorts
of little holes. Jerry found a small hole in the floor and checked it out. It went down
and turned into a crawl way and then dropped. So Amy and Dave checked it out and
it was determined that this was the way to go. The crawl was kind of interesting
because you had to go feet first and blindly feed yourself down over a small drop.
Once every one was through we followed the most obvious way down. A little
climbing led to a room with a muddy floor. Dave told us that the river was right below
this room so we have to find a way down. A little searching and this was
accomplished quite easily. We went through the hole and came to river. We were
excited because we thought it would be easy from here but when we touched the
water it really wasn't that warm, but it was warmer that cave water.
A search for the way began. We tried to follow the stream up and down but to
no avail. I started going up the breakdown thinking maybe we could go over
something. I pushed myself up through a hole in the ceiling and came into a room.
