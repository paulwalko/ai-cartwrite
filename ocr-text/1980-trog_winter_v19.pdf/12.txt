DRINKING FOR EFFECT
THE DTC REPORT
The DTC was priveledged this past New Years to objectively survey a
typical drinking accident. Here are the facts:
On January 1, 1980 it was discovered that large quantities of alcohol
had not been consumed during the previous evening's party. In an attempt
to rectify the situation, a number of people began "drinking for effect" by
passing the remaining intoxicants around. Consumed were several bottles of
rum, bourbon, brandy, and wine. Included was a bottle of the infamous "Red
Rocket", which is thought to be a by-product of the Soviet space program.
The results were spectacular. We observed a complete party scene taking
place in the space of two hours-. drinking, singing, rowdiness and finally,
complete pass-out. Of particular interest to the DTC were two hard-drinking
fellows. These men gave excellent examples of how to correctly and incor-
rectly "drink for effect". Here's our analysis:
Â· Drinker number one prepared for the party in several ways, most importantly
by eating a hearty meal of spaghetti beforehand. We know this to be true by
an analysis of the contents of his stomach, which were graciously provided
to us. He also showed excellent training by passing out in the face-down
position, long recognized as the optimum position for long-term stupors. We
can only find fault in his actual drinking technique. The man obviously
missed his target effect-- in fact, it was a disasterous overshot. But only
time and practice can solve that. We are happy to report that this man was
back in action the next night.
Drinker number two did nothing to prepare for the party. The alcohol hit
an empty stomach.. a stomach that had seen ation at the previous night's
party-- and went immediately into his blood. The result was almost instant
drunkeness which rapidly developed into heaving. Since only the liquor
could be thrown up dry heaves quickly developed and, due to the shock of
so much booze so quickly, the man rapidly passed into a state of near shock.
DTC technicians were concerned enough that they complied with the man's
request for medical attention. No complications developed, but it is ex-
pected that this unit will not see action again for several weeks.
The lessons of this accident are qua te obvious. Drink on a full sto-
mach. It will give you more control over the alcohol and also makes puking
more tolerable. Use extreme caution when "drinking for effect". This is
a technique that should only be used by experienced personnel and even they
often find the proper effect range" hard to judge.
NOTICE
The DTC will be sponsoring several field trips on Feb. 15 & 16, 1980. Inquire
if interested. A demonstration of "effect drinking" will also be given on
the 16th.
