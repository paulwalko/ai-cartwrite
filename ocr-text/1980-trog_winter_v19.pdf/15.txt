as it kicked up a spray. Finally, I could see my belayer pulling me clear of
the water where I touched down.
The bottom of the pit was level with a cobble floor. Everything was soaked
from the spray. The rest of the group rappelled with Bob pulling up the rear
.
--at least we thought he was last, Upon touching down he informed us that
another caver was behind him. It turned out to be Marion "Baggy" Smith, the
author of The Exploration and Survey of Ellison's Cave, Georgia, and a friend
of Smokey's. He was going solo, but stayed with us for a few hundred feet of
passage to the Gypsum Room, where we all ate dinner. After eating, Marion
took off for parts unknown and Smokey took us On a tourist trip.
I knew that there was a lot of passage at the bottom of the pit, but I
wasn't expecting anything special. Boy, was I wrong. At a rapid pace Smokey
lead us to one outstanding sight after another. First we came to Snowball
Dome, about a 200' unexplored pit going up with a neat "Snowball" formation
at the bottom. Then through the Slickens ides, where you could see clearly
how the rock faces on a fault had skid and worn grooves in each other. More
passage a nd on to the North Pole, a clear stalactite of epsomite salt. This
formation was not transluscent, but clear as glass. Past huge accumulations
of moonmilk at the Gnome Creamery, we came to our final destination, Angel's
Paradise. This area's walls were completely covered with pure white formations
of epsomite-needles and flowers. Some of these fragile formations are over a
foot long a nd they comprise a truly spectacular sight. All of the Virginians
were duly impressed and I declared Ellison's the prettiest as well as the deepen
est cave I had ever done,
After backtracking we arrived at the bottom of Fantastic. To speed things
up we decided to climb two at a time on each rope. I had heard of tanden, but
this was more like quadrophonic. Bob and I climbed together on the 586' to
the Attic. The way up wasn't really scary at all. Maybe I was too tired to
be scared. After 45 minutes on the rope we reached the top and blew a whistle
to inform the guys below that we were off rope. The whistle proved unsatis.
factory because they never heard it below. After much confusion we finally
noticed the rope tense up, indigating that someone was climbing. After a while
Ben approached the lip, informing us that he could feel from the rope movement
that Bill was climbing below, but that he had not seen him for several hundred
feet. A half hour later Bill reached the lip soaking wet and with his lamp
out. Being the last climber, he had nobody to hold him clear of the spray at
the bottom. The water had attacked his lamp, forcing him to climb the entire
drop in the dark.
Patigue and a rig malfunction caused Kent to spend even more time climbing
the Warm-up Pit than he'd spent in Fantastic. We were all fading fast as we
hauled our gear and weary bodies out into the warm Georgia night. Suokey
again demonstrated his superior experience by being the only one with a cold
beer at the entrance. The rest of us had to wait until we reached the camp
where hot food and strong drink finished us off for the night.
The next morning Smokey entertained us with an Ellison's slide show and
we headed back north. The trip had put us all on a natural high that lasted
for months. It was easily the best trip I have ever had. FANTASTICI
