NEWBERRY-BANE CAVE
On October 27, 1979 Richard Cobb, Hugh Beard, Jim Richards, Ron McEwen,
Karl Koon, and Joey Fagan went to Newberry-bane Cave. The primary purpose
for the trip was to install a new gate for the cave owner, Buddy Penley,
but we could not go to Skydusky Hollow and not go caving. The gate in
question provided the primary access across Buddy's land to Newberry's.
Vandals had stolen the original gate, which was later recovered, but that's
another story.
After checking by Buddy's house, we all headed for Newberry's. The
usual pre-trip duties were taken care of and the 600 drop at the entrance
was rigged; all rappelled in without incident. Richard and Jim proceded
ahead to rig the 15' nuisance drop just beyond the Straddle Pit traverse.
Eventually everyone crossed the Straddle Pit and negotiated the short drop
to reach to top of Bill's Rappel canyon, an impressive 1600 deep pit.
Richard's PMI rope was quickly rigged in preparation for the descent. All
members of the group then rappelled down to the cave's lower level.
Once on the bottom of the rappel, we' stashed our vertical equipment
and headed for the Vault Room. After a brief stop for a carbide change, a
side trip was made to the base of Triple Wells, a 200' domepit which is the
deepest known drop in any Virginia cave. We then proceeded to the Main
Subway. The subway appears to be an abandoned phreatic conduit; the
abundance of pendants, potholes, and spongework indicate that this passage
probably was formed beneath the water table. Many bats were observed
throughout the lower section of the cave. Visitors to Newberry-Bane, or
other caves containing bats should excercise extreme care to avoid disturbing
the bats.
After a few hours of poking around the lower level, we started out of
the cave, Richard, Hugh, Ron, and Karl climbed out by way of the Devil's
Staircase. Jim and I opted for a rope ascent of Bill's Rappel. I climbed
out first, using my Gibbs ascenders, while Jim decided to follow using prusik
knots. Upon arriving at the top of the drop, we coiled the rope and headed
for the entrance. The entrance drop was free-climbed by all using a self
belay. Six satisfied cavers finall emerged from Newberry's after spending
six hours underground.
