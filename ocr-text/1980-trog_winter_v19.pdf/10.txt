CAVING IN THAILAND
Par away in the tropical jungles of Thailand, the Thai-Am caving
grotto once thrived. There were caves to be discovered and explored in-
cluding that of the fire cave.
Our party arrived at a Buddist Wat on one sunny Saturday morning back
in early 1974. We were there to stage our assault on a 90 foot pit which
Thai locals had mentioned on a previous P.R. trip. Hiking up the mountain
and traversing its side, we passed potential entrances. Pushing apart the
undergrowth, we narrowly escaped the almost instant death of a green pit
viper. off to the side I pulled back a tree branch and looked down a
seemingly bottomless pit. After dropping a few rocks in I let go of the
branch only to have my helmet knocked off. Down it fell bau ncing till it
could no longer be heard; not to be retrieved until some months later,
. As we climbed higher, we could look out to the North & West inabling
us to see the eerie looking mountains of this Asian karst which often had
large inaccessable black holes in their faces.
Finially we turned a corner and there was the entrance, about 15 feet
by 10 feet. Inside was a flat floored entrance room with a 20 foot ceiling.
About 30 feet into the cave was a 10 foot high wall. From the top of the
wall one could look down 90 feet to the bottom and up about 150 feet to a
skylight in the ceiling.
The rope had to be rigged to a large boulder outside the entrance.
We began to drop the pit, approximately nine of us in all. Earl & Peggy
Geil, Jim Brewer & son (Pumpkin), Greg & Jeff Lett, Steve Egan, Kurt Hollier
and myself. It was obvious that we hadn't been the first ones in the cave.
There was a ladder leaning against the wall made of pieces of bamboo lashed
together end to end. We joked about the ladder daring one another to try
it on the way out.
At the bottom we went on to explore the cave, The passage was large,
but not very extensive. We finially began to climb out. Peggy, Pumpkin
and Kurt were at the top when they began to complain about a brush fire out
on the mountain. Jeff climbed out and the complaints continued with the
added difficulty of smoke in the entrance room, Then I climbed out. As I
got to the top the others were caughing from the smoke building up and it
appeared that very little was flowing up and out of the skylight above the
pit.
Greg began to climb out; we noticed that flames were beginning to engulf
the boulder to which the rope was rigged. By this time Greg was about 30
to 40 feet off the bottom, His brother Jeff yelled down to him that we
would have to derig the rope with him still on it. Greg screamed back with
all kinds of death threats, but it was no use. We told him to leave his
cams on the rope and to start climbing the bamboo ladder. Meanwhile, the
rope was derigged and we all held on to it as a belay. The smoke was worse
than ever now and the flames were shooting into the entrance room. The rope
jerked again and again as Greg swayed back and forth on the unstable ladder.
It finially seemed that we were near the point of smoke asphyxiation. Being
assured by the others that the rope could be held securely without me, I
jumped through the flames and out onto the smokey mountainside. I got a few
breaths of air and went back inside to relieve someone else. This continued
until Greg was out of the pit. By this time the flames had died down and
those of us at the top of the pit all staggered out of the cave gasping and
