ourselves at home. Joey set up our "Christmas Tree"; the last few inches
of the top of his tree at home. We decorated it with little bits of colored
paper. A little "speleo-engineering" created a clothesline out of avalanche
cord, a Gibbs and some biners.
: We laid out all of our food so we'd know what we had to eat. As it
turned out, we had brought enough food to eat very well for the whole trip.
I looked over at Lawrence's "pantry''. All of the cans were lined up in
lines of military precision. It was laid out so neatly it seemed a shape to
ruin the order by removing something to eat, but that didn't stop him. I
unpacked a dozen eggs I'd brought along with some trepidation, but only one
was cracked! (I destroyed another by poking my finger through it when I
picked it up though.)
A little after 9 pm we heard sounds down the passage. Our support team
was coming. We quickly took off all of our clothes and turned out our
lights. Shortly thereafter the support team came upon 3 naked gurus,
sitting on sleeping bags in full lotus positions and chanting. As it was
chilly, the gurus did not stay naked long.
Pete, Jozo, Fran, Billy the Kid, and Jerry Redder had brought in about
2 cases of beer (our survival equipment). Since Joe, Fran, the Kid and Jerry
were to be leaving again soon, they stuck mostly to Cokes. Pete, Joey,
Lawrence and I were not so inhibited. We cooked a scrumptious dinner. I
had a broken egg sandwich and a hamburger for dinner. Joey broke out a
freeze dried meal, and Jerry shared a 24 lb, can of beef stew with Pete.
After eating a poker game was started, with chips of carbide for stakes.
Joey and I annoyed everyone with our flashes as we took pictures of everything.
A good time was had by all. Our support team eventually (and reluctantly)
decided it was time to leave. since they all had obligations the next day.
As they crawled down the passage Joey and I chased thelli with our cameras,
taking pictures of a bunch of butts disappearing into the darkness.
Left all alone, Pete, Joey, Lawrence and myself partied till late
before we turned in. Sleeping in total darkness was an experience. Your
eyes would begin to play tricks on you. You'd open your eyes and could
swear you faintly saw the passage outline. But when you used a light source
you'd find out that nothing was where you had "geen" it.
Pete was first to arise around 8, and the rest of us followed soon
after. After much stumbling and fumbling with carbide lamps we cooked a
royal breakfast and discussed our plans for the day. We had originally
planned to dig out and explore the new passage Stephens had found. Being
faced with the actual prospect changed our minds however. It's one thing
to get all ruddy and grungy and then leave the cave. But we didn't relish
the idea of climbing into our sleeping bags that night any sleazier than was
necessary. We could already tel1 by this point that even with care we were
still going to be pretty gross by the time we left the cave. With the
grosser parts rules out, we decided to poke around over towards the Banes
entrance.
Our progress would have been fairly rapid if it had not been for Joey
and I with our camera equipment. Just as everyone would get moving, Joey
and I would stop everything and take a picture or two, Mutterings of "Damn
Photographers" became louder as the day wore on. After seeing a lot of
passage and taking a lot of pictures we returned to camp for lunch and a
B.S. session.
Pete had to return home that evening so we went with him up the Devils
Staircase to the bottom of the Nusiance Drop. We watched him climb the
