THE '79 NEWBERRY'S EXPEDITION
"Two Fingers Are Best"
Joey Fagan and I had planned a camping trip in Newberry's over
Thanksgiving break, but we both got colds and decided to postpone the trip
till Christmas break. Joey was considering taking over the Newberry's
project and wanted to familiarize himself with some more of the cave, and
we both wanted to take pictures and experiment with cave camping techniques.
The original trip had been planned for one night. By the time the trip
came around after finals week, the "expedition" had grown by the addition of
Pete Sauvigne and Lawrence Britt, and we even had a support team to "bring
in supplies".
Joey, Lawrence and I were going to go in Monday and set up camp. Pete
would come in with the support team after work and stay with us when the
support team left. After last minute packing and arrangements and haggling
at John's Camera for flash equipment we were on our way. The weather teased
us with snow flurries, the wind was blowing and the air was cold.
We finially (and eagerly) descended into the warmth of the cave about
3 pm. I rappelled into the entrance with my duffle bag hanging about 10
feet below me on a piece of sling. I wanted to try the technique out before
I used it on Bill's Rappel. By clipping the sling into the end of the rack
all of the bag weight was transferred to the rack, leaving me free of the load.
The technique worked well. I unrigged on the flat area half way down so I
could relay the bags lowered to me over to the remaining drop. Once at the
bottom we struggled and grunted and sweated getting all of our equipment
thru the passage to the top of Bill's. We had 3 duffel bags, a rucksack,
plus ropes, a ladder, our vertical gear and our cave packs to haul. We kept
shuttling gear along the passage till we neared the Straddle Pit. Lawrence
and I passed the equipment over the pit, and then it took just a short time
to rig the Nusiance Drop above Bill's..
After rigging Bill's we had lightened our load by the ropes, a ladder
and some sling. We divided the remaining gear up so that we would all rappel
with part of the load. Joey was first over the lip with duffel bags and
pack tied on while I took pictures of hin descending the 160'..
We had previously thought that the bottom of Bill's would be a
milestone in our trip on the way in, and we congratulated ourselves on how
soon we'd arrived there. It seems like we were a little premature though,
since there's where the trip started getting hard. I had never considered
the passage from the bottom of Bill's to the Vault room to be difficult,
but I'd never tried to haul a fully packed heavy duffel bag through there
either! We were almost wiped out by the time we reached the Vault room.
Once in the Vault room we stopped to rest and fill out the register, being
as quiet as we could so as not to disturb the bats there. Finially we
reluctantly coerced our aching bodies into moving on. We headed towards
the Main Subway, dragging our duffel bags with us. We crawled, stooped and
duckwalked for several hundred feet of passage. Every possible camping area
we looked at had some flaw, not enough room, not level, etc. Finially,
just before we dropped from exhaustion we found an ideal location. It was
an inverted "T" shaped passage. You could walk along the center of the passage
and each side was high enough to roll out a sleeping bag and sit on it
without hitting your head.
With great relief we set up camp. We unrolled our sleeping bags,
changed into clean clothes we'd brought along to sleep in, and made
