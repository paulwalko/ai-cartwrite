REPAIRING YOUR WATER VALVE
Through long use (or by being overly enthusiastic in making sure your
water is turned off) your water valve does not shut off completely, or its
normal range of adjustment is past the indentations so that it's hard to
control. Do not despair, throw away your lamp or use it as an excuse to
stop caving. Repair is as easy as finding someone with a propane torch and
then investing about five minutes of work.
First, a little about how the valve works. A tapered plug in the end of
the valve tube controls the flow rate. The plug is held in place by a rod
which runs up through the water tube and through a threaded sleeve at the
tip. At the end of the sleeve it is bent into the hook you control your
water with. The threads on the sleeve are of relatively fine pitch, so that
over a half-rotation (the normal range of the valve) there is very little
vertical movement of the plug. This movement is sufficient to control the
approximately drip-a-second rate required, however.
The problem arises when the half a circle the control handle turns in is
not "synchronized" with the half of rotation that controls the flow. The
lamp is easily "synchronized" by melting the solder in the sleeve and repo-
sitioning the rod relative to the sleeve. The procedure is as follows:
Set the water valve at approximately base to 2/3 of the way to full open.
Remove the lamp bottom and, holding. the body firmly, press the tapered plug
end firmly down on the workbench. While maintaining this pressure heat the
top of the sleeve (with a sideways flame ) until the solder melts and you
feel the r od "click" up into a new position. Remove heat and keep pressing
down till the solder cools.
That's it! You just repaired your lamp. Fill it with water and make sure
it adjusts properly. If not, reposition the valve and repeat the procedure.
Fill lamp bottom with carbide and screw onto lamp. Attach lamp to hardhat.
rio caving. This procedure works equally well for Premier or Justrite lamps.
