STATE OF THE GROTTO
As winter quarter gets under way, VPI Grotto is alive and well.
Attendence at moetings has been high and there are a lot of prospective
members. For this we can thank Richard Cobb's dedication to his work
as Vice-President and Win Wright's work as publicity chairman. Both
vertical sessions went well with a good turn out of interested people.
Special thanks to all those who helped.
November's ridge walk at East River Mountain helped locate some
potential caves and set records straight. A few small mapping projects
were spurred by this and hopefully there are more to come. Much thanks
to Bill Koerschner for organizing the walk and finishing Spring Hollow
(thank goodness for that).
The Halloween party had a good mixture of old and new people. The
party was good as far as I can remember. Thanks to Doug Perkins, Hugh
Beard, Joe Zokaites, Pat Shorten, Win Wright, and Mr. Hylton of the
Prices Fork Grango.
With these things behind us we must keep our goals in mind. Since
last spring's elections three members. have been added to our roster.
A number of people are quite close to becoming members and the member-
ship goal of twelve new members should be met. But let's not stop
there, it's everyone's responsibility to make sure there are as many
trips going out as possible. Ideas, techniques, and other acquired
information must be passed on. Mapping and locating caves should re-
main an intergral part of our activities. Vertical work must be learned
and practiced by all. Knowing how to go up and down a rope is only
the boginning. The hazards are many and knowlodge in every area, from
rigging to changing over, should be second nature to everyone. An
advanced vertical session is in the planning for the spring.
In early September, the Old Timers Reunion and Speleo-Olympics will
be held. VPI Grotto has had a very strong showing for many years.
Here, vertical techniques can be used to win both personal gain (prizes)
and club honor. As we cave throughout the year, let's keep OTR in mind
and plan to kick a-- next September.
Practice rescues were promised and the first one will be on January
19th. This will be an excellent opportunity for prospective and regu-
lar members alike to be exposed to problems which may arise. As a large
grotto, it is our job to be ready for rescues.
As a grotto within the NSS, we encourage members to join the NSS.
This increases our voting power at BOG meetings and helps the NSS by
providing funds for projects and keeping a more accurate tally on the
number of active cavers. Most of all, it benefits the individual caver
by giving access to a wider variety of NSS publications plus a free
subscription to the NSS News and Bulletin. It may also increase ones
ability to meet and confer with other active cavers. :
In closing, I want to encourage both prospective and regular members
to be active in all club activities. Help keep our grotto the best
in the NSS.
