choking, but relieved. When it was safe again, we rerigged the rope and the
others climbed out safely. As we came off the mountain, night was setting in.
We were all perplexed and angry over the fire which had apparently been
purposely set,
Later we learned that this was the case. It seems that every year the
local Thais burn off the side of the mountain in order to kill off the cobra
population. Unfortunately their burning had coincided with our caving and
could have been fatal.
What could have been done to prevent this hazard?
1. Better communication and understanding between us and the Thais.
This was difficult with the language barrier.
2. Once the smoke and fire had begun to pose a threat, people should
have remained on the bottom and the rope derigged. However, at the
bottom it was hard to accept the true threat of the fire outside
and communication had become very poor with the noise of the fire
crackling outside and the constant coughing of those at the top. :
3. Don't cave where cobras dare. We had only seen green pit vipers.
