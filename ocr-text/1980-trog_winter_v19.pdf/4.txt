VICE-PRESIDENTS COLUMN
While at the Hokie House the other night, our editor assaulted me
with physical violence for not having written a VP column yot. Pat
promised oven further violence and a nasty note in the TROG if I didn't
have something in by the following Friday. I pointed out to Pat that
it would be difficult for me to write anything while she had me locked
in a Full Nelson. (Ed. note -I don't even know what a Full Nelson is!)
After much persuasion and many promises on my part, she finally (and
relunctantly) agreed that I had a point and released me. Having a
profound respect for my well being, I decided not to put this off any
longer. So here, with no further ado, are my eagerly awaited words
of wisdom.
Uh,...Well,...That is...
Actually (and seriously), there are things I would like to discuss.
The training program seems to be going well. It is important now that
we get some good new members who are going to be around awhile. The
club is in a transition period. There are only a few members at present
who have been around for more than a year or two, and most of those people :
are getting ready to leave. Traditionally, most of our new members
have been freshmen or sophomores who were able to pass on their know-
ledge in the two or three years they had remaining at Va. Tech. In
the past year or so, many of our new members have come in as upper
classmen or grad students, and as a result, they are only with us a
short while. With this kind of rapid turnover, many club practices and
traditions could be easily lost.
As an example, how many people presently in the club know how to
modify the foot cam on a Gibbs ascender so that it will be easier to
break loose on the rope? Or how many people know the reasons for using
shock cord instead of surgical tubing for the elastic in a "ropewalker"?
These concepts and many more have been worked out by VPI members, but
this knowledge is in danger of being lost through turnover.
So, for those of us who are leaving in the near future, do what
you can to pass on the tricks of the trade! Things like rappelling
and prussiking will be passed on through the training program. What
is important is the little things you learn along the way. Things like
a system you may have worked out for reading the brunton faster or how
to place stations for greater reading ease. The list is endless. Re-
member, if you don't pass on the knowledge, it could be lost when you
leave.
Now for all you up and coming new members, keep in mind that in a
year or so you will be the VPI Cave Club. Take every opportunity to
learn all you can. Something you learn now may save your life someday,
or someone else's.
The VPI Cave Club has been and is a great organization. Whatever
else anyone may say about us, none can deny that a VPI caver is a first
class caver. While much of the proficiency of the VPI caver can be
attributed to our training program, it is not just proficient cavers
that make VPI great. Our strength lies in the fact that we believe
in the club and ourselves. Despite personal differences that may arise
from time to time, in times of personal or club crisis we are a family
ready to pull together to do what must be done.
