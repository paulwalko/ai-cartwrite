EDITORIAL
I never thought getting articles for a TRUG could be so difficult. ..
once I got all those articles I never expected all the help I got! I'd like
to thank Clark Kent (alias Jay Kennedy), Lois Lane (alias Robyn Lefon), and
rete Sauvigne for all their help typing. Special thanks go to Hugh Beard far
his typing' and helping me edit. All artwork and articles are very much apprec-
iated; they helped make this a TRDG come true!
And now for the editorial part of the editorial. ...
I realize that most of our regular members have not been with us very long.
Does this excuse them from serving on committees, helping with club activities
and sharing club responsibilities? Months ago a visiting associate member
said that agsociate members who regularly attend meetings should step aside
and allow regular members to run the club. Since then I've been wondering
exactly what our committees are and who chairs these committees. ... Dees
anyone really know? From what I've been able to uncover most of the commit-
tees are chaired by associate members. Is this due to increasing apathy or
lack of information?
Having associate members chair committees is in itself not bad except that
VPI Grotto is a student organization. Also, many of our chair people live out
of town and don't regularly attend meetings. This means that 1) they are not
current with the club and 2) whatever their committee is supposed to be doing
takes too long to get done. Certainly many associate members enjoy the jobs
they do and should keep their position but even they should be showing new
people how to handle those jobs. There are obviously certain committees or
jobs that can be handled better by associate members due to their interest,
time limitations, etc. But should all the thankless jobs fall on associate
members' shoulders? Perhaps more regular and prospective members should get
involved in behind-the-scene activities,
Granted, caving is our priority but to be a caving organization voting
members must support club activities and help make them possible. Certainly
I have not been with the club long enough to criticize the chairing that's
been done. I'd just like to see more students doing the work, sharing the
responsibilities and getting involved. How else will you know what to do
when older members leave?
