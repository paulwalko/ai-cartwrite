PIG HOLE CAVE RESCUE
On Saturday, December 1st, two VPI students rappelled into the 120 foot
entrance pit of Pig Hole. They had no ascending devices with which to
climb back up the rope. They did not know the cave at all but expected
to be able to exit through the back drainpipe opening. Moving by guesswork,
thega. made it as far as the Mud Bridge before one of them dropped his flash-
light and it rolled into Hess!: Hollow. With one flashlight and two spare
batteries as their sole light source and not having any idea of how to get
to the back exit, they decided to return to the entrance pit and hope for
a rescue.
It is not clear exactly how the report that initiated the rescue ori.
ginated. It appears that a more experienced (yet unaffiliated) caver had
left his gloves in the cave on an earlier trip that same day. Our under-
standing is that he returned that night to the field in which Pig Hole
lies and heard them from the pit. He apparently phoned in the report.
In any event, the message that reached the Giles County Rescue Squad said
nothing about Pig Hole (or any cave at all) but described the general area
in sufficient de tail that it was presumed to be Pig Hole.
When the radio tones went off, announcing the rescue, I was two miles
from Pig Hole conversing with my uncle J. C. "'Jake" Link. Simultaneous to
alerting rescue squad members, calls were being made to notify VPI grotto.
Very soon I found myself paying the price for not keeping my gear ready to
go at all times; changing carbide while riding up Mountain Lake Road in a
Bronco with no dome light. At that time it was unknown whether or not there
were any injuries. Several of us arrived at the scene in private vehicles
followed by an ambulance. I stepped over the fence that surrounds the pit
and saw a small amount of light trickling out of the cave. We called down
to them and discovered that there were two of them, uninjured and not yet
hypothermic. At this point VPI Grotto was again contacted and told that
a major rescue would not be needed.
A piece of PMI rope had been rigged in a very poor spot with no padding
even though the overhang was rough. The quickest way to reach them would
have been to rig with the Coldline we carry in the ambulance. Trusting the
rescuees! rope was out of the question. The simplest method was to go in
the back way and lead them out. We decided on the later course so I pro-
ceeded to the back entrance and dropped through the drainpipes. .
After I reached them, the guy who (presumably), called in the rescue
decided to rappel down and look for his gloves. He wanted to exit by him-
self, but I requested that he stay with us. On the way out, I heard one
of the rescuees remark to the other that they never would have found their
way out.
Climbing out the drainpipes I was greeted by Bill Stevens, Rich Cobb and
Pete Sauvigne. - Representing the rescue squad were J. C. Link, Captain Steve
Davis, Avery Dolinger and Larry Reynolds. I hope that those rescuees can
learn from this experience and become good cavers.
This is probably a good opportunity for me to get on a soapbox about in-
experienced "freelance" caving. An experienced caver would never have gone
into a cave that he could not reasonably expect to get out of. If this had
happened to a well-trained caver, he would have fashioned helical knots from
the end of the climbing rope and prusiked to safety. If anyone is ever ser-
iously injured in Pig Mole, a major rescue involving hauling a Stokes litter
out of the entrance pit will be needed. Trained cavers are not immune to in-
jury, but they are more conscious of safety and their own limits. I only
hope that such incidents as this one do not damage landowner relations or
give caving a bad name.
