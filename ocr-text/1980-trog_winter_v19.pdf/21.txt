discussed that should be kept in mind for anyone planning a similar venture:
We brought many candles for use around camp, but they didn't see much use.
The skinny candles burn too fast and the flame goes down into the thick
candles, causing shadows just where you need the light. We ended up using
carbide almost exclusively as our light source. A major consideration on
a trip or this sort is whether or not to use cook stoves. On the plus side,
cave water can be heated for sterilization and freeze-dried foods can be
used instead of canned to save some weight. On the negative side, the fumes.
are not natural to the cave environment, and could be dangerous without good
air movement. For our trip we had a small group and strong air flow, so we
decided the effects would not be that great. We had taken great care to
situate ourselves well away from any large groups of hibernating bats that
might be disturbed. But whether or not to cook on a camping trip should
be given serious consideration for each case, and ruled out for a large
number of people or bad air flow. A certain amount of cooking can be done
over carbide lamps if the stoves are not a good idea.
One of our great pleasures was being able to change from our caving
clothes to "clean" clothes when back in camp. If camping you should have
at least one change of clothes that are to be used for nothing but sleeping
and sitting in camp.
Finially, one should never lose sight of the ecological aspects of a
camping trip. Regardless of the care taken, a group of people in an area.
for several days is going to have an effect. For this reason camping trips
should not become popular as a regular activity, espically not when bats
are hibernating. Although we took every precaution possible, it was still
obvious that we had disturbed at least a few bats. We on the trip have i
decided that we won't go on another camping trip until the bats have come
out of hibernation and the impact of a camping trip is minimized.
