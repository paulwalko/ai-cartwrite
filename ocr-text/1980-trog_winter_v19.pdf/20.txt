ladder and waited for him to let us know he had made it across the Straddle
Pit. We put on our vertical gear and prepared to descend Bill's Rappel.
Joey and I had gotten some of the huge "photon-torpedo" flashbulbs from
John's Camera. Joey and Lawrence (with my camera) hung on the lip as I
rappelled down with the flashgun. About 30 feet down I locked off my rack
and Joey and Lawrence opened the camera shutters. I pointed the flashgun
below me and closed my eyes. The first bulb didn't work but the second
one made me see red through my eyelids, leaving me little doubt that it had
worked. .
After returning to camp we had a few beers as it was evening by then.
We decided we didn't want to sit in camp the rest of the evening, but we
also knew we shouldn't do anything serious with a few beers in us. We
finially took a stroll down walking passage to the end of the Main Subway,
noting locations for pictures the next day. While on our stroll we discussed
the philosophy of life and caving and finially arrived at a very important
realization. We determined that this one insight made the whole expedition
worthwhile, and that we must never allow ourselves to forget it. Unfortun-
ately, it is not the sort of insight une can explain, one either immediately
and intuitively realizes the great truth inherent in the statement, or they
are forever doomed to go through life without experiencing this great flash
of inspiration. For those of you with the enlightment to understand this
basic tenent of caving then, here it is: "Two fingers are best." I realize ,
this will not make sense to most people. All I can say is that there are
still many uther pleasures and experiences that life has to offer to those
so deprived.
Returning to camp we assessed our supplies and realized that unless we
ate a lot of food and drank a lot of beer thet night, we were going to have
a lot to carry out the next day. So we ate and drank and partied till late
before we turned in.
We didn't get up till almost 10 the next morning because we knew we'd
need some rest to get our gear out. After breakfast we packed up our gear
and cleaned up the campsite. Wanting to leave some mark of the '79
expedition, we concealed 2 beers near the camping area as a challenge for
future trips to find. Also, wanting to leave a more visible mark, we decided
to dedicate the "'79 Expedition Memorial Carbide Dump" which was placed near
the camp spot.
After some multiple flash photography in the Main Subway we began the
grueling trip out. Once again we considered reaching the bottom of Bill's
to be a major milestone on the way out, but this time a little more realist-
ically.
I was the filst up the rope with another "torpedo". This time I had
the flash pointing up the drop with the cameras on the bottom. After. '
Lawrence had reached the top we hauled the 3 duffel bags up in 3 hauls
while Joey tied the equipment on at the bottom. By the time the third haul
was done we nad jelly for arms and were rapidly reaching an exhausted state.
The remainder of the trip, espically once past the Stradale Pit, was almost
unbearable in our tired state.
We finially dragged our weary bodies out of the entrance around 7 pm.
We had had no idea of what sort of weather to expect when we left, whether
it would be clear or under several feet of snow. As it turned out the stars
were shining and the temperature was much milder than when we had gone in
2 days before. We gratefully stumbled down the hill with our gear to the
car and opened the 3 beers we'd brought back out with us for just that
moment.
Â· The ""79 Expedition" was over. We learned a lot. A few things we
