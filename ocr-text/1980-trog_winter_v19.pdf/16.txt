THE RAPPEL
I had only a small amount of caving and rappelling experience.
I signed up for a trip to Pig Hole along with ten other people. Pig
Hole has an eighty foot rappel into the entrance, and a hundred sixty
foot rappel after the cave has been entered.
I was a prospective member of the cave club, so I approached the
leader of the trip, Richard. He talked about the procedure and then
started discussing the euphoria he felt when he made the rappels. I
didn't understand what he meant by euphoria, but he told me I would
realize exactly what he meant when I made the rappels the next day.
We reached the cave entrance and prepared for the trip. The ropes
were tested and rigged; we were finally ready to enter the cave. I
had anticipated the trip, and when I was finally rigged to the rope,
I began to realize why. I stood over the edge of the drop, and real-
ized the only thing that kept me from falling was a single rope, a
few carabiners, and the friction I applied with my own strength. As
I started down the cliff, I was choked by a fear that some thing was
going to fail. The further I descended though the more that feeling
faded to one of confidence and excitement. I felt a high, and real-
ized what Richard had meant when he talked about euphoria.
I had heard people experienced highs from drugs, but I knew that
what I was experiencing wouldn't compare to that. I had complete
control of all my senses, but I felt unattached to my physical being.
I felt like shouting and screaming with joy. I had never experienced
that feeling before. It was a mixture of all the emotions I had ever
felt and the combination was overwhelming. I was soaring emotionally.
I felt like a bird free from the earth.
When I reached the bottom of the rappel and my feet touched the
ground, the euphoria faded. I felt a feeling of pleasure, but nowhere
near as intense as it had been only a few seconds earlier.
We made the second rappel, and the same feeling returned. I knew
from that point on that the only time I would experience that feeling
was when I was rappelling.
I've rappelled every chance I've gotten since that day and ex-
perienced the same euphoria.' It can be explained, but the words lack
the intensity of that feeling.
