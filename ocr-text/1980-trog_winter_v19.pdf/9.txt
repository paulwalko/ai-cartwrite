THE TELLTALE PASSAGE
It was yet another hungover Saturday morning last spring. Ed Devina,
Bill Koerschner, and I started another Paul(bahl) Penley trip, planning
to clean up some leads. Trips of this type into Paul's end up pretty grim
but they have also pushed Paul's to almost 4.2 miles.
The leads to be pushed were at the dry northernmost end of the cave,
and Ed had some high hopes of breaking into some new passage. We had made
it well into the cave before we realized that the ladder had been forgotten.
We were forced into taking the longer route to bypass the ladder climb. In
the process, more energy was expended and I found myself drinking too much
water.
All the leads choked with no difficulties except the last lead. Some-
times you just know when a crawl is going to be bad. Well, this gypsum slot
with a slight z. let us know how bad it was when Koerschner, on lead tape,
tried to push it. The passage literally boomed to the beat of his heart. I
was waiting for Rod Steiger to walk up and tell us that the chicken heart
had eaten Paul Penley's cave. Bill couldn't make it, so I gave it a try.
Grunts and groans and heartbeats but no way. However, Edi Devine made it
through with a cry of pain, then a whoop of joy. After trying again
Koerschner made it but I still could not. Laying stuck in a narrow slot
with piss dripping from your lamp, because you ran out of water, is not
helped by the amplified heartthrobs. I finally made it through using the
incredible new caving technique called the "backward-bending knee." Works
wonders for arthritis.
There wasn't really very much back there. We mapped about sixty feet,
leaving one lead gushing air. We called it quits, making it a fourteen
hour trip.
. Later, in the summer, I summoned upon the two crawling kids, Bill
Stephens and Bill Shipman, to go on a Wednesday night to Pauls. This
time I brought the heavy artillery: the three pound sledge and a chisel.
Now I am not into damaging the cave but when it comes to getting stuck,
I'm desperate.
First, I went down into "the Crimper", as the slot was named by Ed
Devine, and I knocked off a few knobs. Then foolishly I sent Shipman
down to widen it some. He said some thing like, "ho problem", then
breezed right on through. This is what I get for not being as small as him.
Oh, well, I figured attempting the Crimper on my side opposite from the
side I had used before, might work better. It didn't and I got stuck. The
heartthrobs were going a mile a minute and echoing throughout the cave as I
got pulled through by Stephans.
Now, pushing out this windy lead proved to be an impossible task, as
Stephens got himself incredibly stuck in the "iz" shaped little mother. I
had to chisel him out of his fate and cut the rock that was inhibiting his
movement.
I learned several lessons on these trips. Most of all, I learned that
when you hear the chicken heart coming, you'd better run. . 'Cause the
chicken heart's out to get you.
