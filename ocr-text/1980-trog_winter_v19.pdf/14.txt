ELLISON'S CAVE
After months of planning, we finally got the rope, transportation and
people together one Saturday in March of 1978. The group included Kent
Seavers and Gregg Clemmer of the Shenandoah Valley Grotto, Bob Alderson,
Bill Arney, Ben Johnson and myself. We pointed Gregg's van towards Lafayette
and contemplated doing the deepest cave pit in the country.
After an 8 hour drive we rolled into Lafayette, Georgia and met Larry
"Smokey" Caldwell at the Pigeon Mountain Industries rope factory. Besides
making some fine rope and fighting fires with the Georgia Forestry Commis-
sion, Smokey has adopted Ellis on's Cave. He usually leaves one of his ropes
permanently rigged in 510' Fantastic pit and yo-yo's the drop as often as i
twice a week. He wasn't sure if he could come with us that Sunday morning,
80 Alder son, who had done the drop before, planned to lead the trip. Smokey
gave us a tour of the PMI operation and lead us to the Blue Hole at the base
of Pigeon Mountain, where we camped.
Sunday morning we ate breakfast and packed our gear for the 2 mile hike
up the mountain to the cave entrance. As we left camp Smokey pulled in ready
to go caving. We had ourselves an expert guide! The trek uphill with 6000
of rope was no fun. Without packframes it would have been unbearable. Fi-
nally we made it up to the "New" Entrance. This route avoids the Agony, a
passage that sounds worth avoiding. After pulling a large rock out of the
entrance we all dropped into the Ecstasy. This large walking passage carried
about six inches of water for a few hundred feet to the Warm-up pit. There
we rigged a piece of Smokey's PMI Off of several bolts and rappelled 125 feet
to the bottom.
From there a couple short drops lead down to the Balcony, where Smokey's
rope was rigged for a 510' drop in Fantastic Pit. We all chose instead to
climb up to the Attic where we could rig Fantastic as a 586' freefall. When
we got to the rigging point Smokey found a thirty pound rock to drop down the
pit. After a long seven second whistling fall, it finally hit with an eerie
deep thud that echoed several times. We were all impressed, and at least a
littlo scared. Everyone sat around saying "Oh, wow!", except Greg who gig-
gled like a kid who'd just discovered lollypops. After we got our wits to
gether we rigged Gregg's new Bluewater and began rappelling, everyone using
a rack, Smokey went first. After a few minutes we heard OFF--OFF--OFF--OFF
ROPE--ROPE--ROPEROPE. Damn! It sounded like Smokey had crossed over to
the twilight zone. A few more oh-WOWS from the chorus and giggles from Gregg
and Bon was rigged in. He was psyched enough to forget to take his ascending
gear down with him.
Then it was my turn. I too got past the lip without my ascending gear.
At this point I was pretty nervous. I had never been so high. Gradually the
fear left me. About seventy feet down I passed the balcony where I could see
Smokey's rope rigged and where a large stream fell into the pit about twenty
feet from me. The stream roared as it crossed the lip, but down a couple
hundred feet it was stone silent. The experience was no longer fearful, just
awesome. The mist obscured vision so that all I could see looking up was
about thirty feet of rope disappearing into darkness. Down looked the same;
no contact with the real world. To the sides I could see the sides of the
dome pit, but they were 80 smooth that only the rope sliding through my rack
told me that I was moving. As the bottom approached, the stream again roared
