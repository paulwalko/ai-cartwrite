VAN LUIK'S CRAWDADS
On November ll, 1979, Janet Queisser and I drove to Greenbrier
County, West Virginia to go caving with Sandy Van Luik. Sandy is
working on a master's degree in biology at Old Dominion University.
Her thesis topic is the life cycle of the crayfish found in Brans-
fords and McLaughlin-Unus Caves. Both caves are in the Cullverson
Creek Cave System which is currently being surveyed by the West
Virginia Association for Cave Studies (WVACS).
Before I describe Sandy's work, I would like to give a brief
introduction to cave biology. Three terms (troglobite, troglophile,
and trogloxene) are used to classify the various life forms found
in caves. A troglobite is a permanent cave dweller. A troglophile
is an animal that perfers a cave environment but is able to live
in similar habitats aboveground. Finally, a trogloxene is an animal
that occasionally visits caves - a VPI caver is a good example (Mohr
and Poulson, 1966, p.l18). In Bransford's Cave Sandy is studying
the crayfish Cambarus bartonii which is a troglophile, while in
McLaughlin-Unus she is working with Cambarus nerterius (Hobbs) which
is a troglobite.
In Bransford's Cave Sandy has set several stream stations which
range from the entrance to the siphon several hundred feet back into
the cave. At each station, crayfish traps are placed in the water.
food to be most alluring. The traps are checked approximately every
two weeks. Each time the air and water temperatures of the stations
are recorded. The crayfish observations are then made.
First, each crayfish is sexed. How does one tell a boy crayfish
from a girl crayfish? Easy enough, the tail is broader in the female.
Also, in the female the first pleopods or abdominal appendages, are
small while these appendages in the male are large (Huxley, 1974,
p. 8). The males are classified into two morphological forms. Form
I is the adult breeding form while form II represents the juvenile.
In the form I males the first pleopods have terminal projections
which are lacking in the juvenile form (Hobbs, 1972, p. 7). A count
of missing appendages is made on both sexes, and the claw or chela of
the male is measured. When females are captured, they are examined
for the presence of eggs.
Each crayfish that is captured is given a number which is painted
on the animal's back with red, non-toxic nail polish. A non-toxic
dye is also injected under the abdomen. When a crayfish is recaptured,
it is injected with a different color of dye. Because the crayfish
population inside a cave is limited in size and distribution, Sandy
is able to capture the same animal several times. By studying the
various recorded changes, Sandy hopes to make conclusions concerning
the life cycle of the two species under study.
Although the study of cave crayfish or any other cave animal is
very interesting, many precautions must be taken to protect these
very delicate life forms. Sandy Van Luik is performing a controlled
study with the help of an experienced cave biospeleologist, Dr. John
Holsinger. A great deal of research has been done to determine that
no observation or material used by Sandy will harm the crayfish pop-
