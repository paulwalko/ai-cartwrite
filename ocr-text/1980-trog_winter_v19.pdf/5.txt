So let's keep our club great. If you're now, you can look forward
to many happy and rewarding times with the club, as well as finding
lifelong friends. But it is also your responsibility, as future members
and officers, to insure that the club is even greater when you leave
it. If you're leaving, pass on your knowledge. It's the little things
that make the difference between a good caver and a VPI caver.

Dear OTR Survivors,
Many thanks for your help Labor Day weekend! Your enthusiam for
involvement was appreciated -- whether it was in copeting in the contests,
manning the nametag gathering post, helping with security, judging the
contests or picking up trash in the pavillion.
The success of OTR was due in a large part to the involvement of
current and past VPI grotto members; we couldn't have done it without
you!
Thanks again, and see you next year...or at at least at banquet!
Cheers,
(heken
