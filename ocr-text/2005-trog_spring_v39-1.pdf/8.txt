Float trip starts at the Ripplemead put-in,
where the rafts are constructed for their 7.5
mile journey down the New River to the take
out in Pearisburg. River level determines how
long the trip will take. On average, it takes
five hours to float this section of the river.

The river level varies from year to year. In 2004,
the river was at an average and optimal level.
Figure 1 below shows the discharge of the river
at Glen Lyn, which is about 10.5 miles down river
from the take out. Some years the river is lower,
and so the ride takes longer. Some years the river
is much higher. On May 23rd, 2001, the discharge Figure 2: Discharge on New River, Float Trip
at Glen Lyn reached a 76 year record high of 32,000 2001 (http://water.usgs.gov)
cubic feet of water per second, illustrated by the
asterisks in Figure 2. That year float trip was two
days later on May 26th. Despite better judgment,
float trip continued. Lessons were learned and
