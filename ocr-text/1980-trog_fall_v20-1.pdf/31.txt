The old Glen Davis survey showed Newberry-Banes to be 4.02 miles.
Sure, there were a number of small finds that could add to this length,
but we wanted to map the more significant stuff, Bill Koerschner de.
cided we should survey and push the pit in the lower portion of Banes.
January 26th saw Bill, Paul Kirchman, Carol Trexler, and myself en-
tering the Banes entrance. We did the drop into the main level and head-
ed upstream to the interior drop. After tying into the old survey, we
surveyed down the 71.5 foot drop. We were now headed downstream and
mapped into the right side lead. The passage soon boomed open with
a large waterfall coming in from 100 feet up. Bill's conjecture that
this might be the water from Bane's Spring leads to another story of
a dig which disproved this hypothesis. Down a few ladder drops, we
pushed to a siphon and returned to finish the main passage, Our total
for the day was 947 feet and a 13 hour trip.
During the next few months a few, trips returned to the Fallopian
Tubes to set dye traps, but further exploration waited for dryer weather.
On July 19th, after a long dry spell, Bob Alderson, Bill, and I re-
turned to the Fallopian Tubes. We surveyed the dig for 52 feet, then
upstream to the side lead. Once up the side lead, we came to the break-
down where Win and I had stopped before. Bob looked around and, figur-
ing it was safe enough, climbed up. I followed and off we went, ditch-
ing the survey.
After a few hundred feet of crawlway we came to some pool crawls.
The air blasting through was very tempting. Once on the other side we
were in a trunk passage about 8x15 feet with a stream. We followed this
upstream for about 1500 feet before it split, ending in a mud fill and
a blowing rock pile. A few compass bearings on the passage set a bee-
line for downstream Spring Hollow.
Back at the pool crawls we met Bill. We were wet and cold, but de-
cided to leave the new find for now and finish the main stream trunk.
We froze our buns off in the water, mapping through two near sumps to
an upstream siphon. We turned around with just over 1100 feet survey- -
ed. The trip out, half hypothermic after 14 hours, made this one of the
worst trips any of us could remember.
Once again, on August 23rd, Alderson, Bill, Ben Keller, and I return-
ed, with a crowbar. Bill and Ben went through the Fallopian Tubes to
continue the survey while Alderson and I checked out a few high leads
in the North Subway extension area. After much disappointment, we went o
and joined the survey.
Mapping into the crawlways, Ben and Bill found a side lead which
proved to be rather significant. We joined up with them and finally
quit surveying at the pool crawls. Even though we had the crowbar we
couldn't bring ourselves to sliding through the pools. We left the
cave with 1024 feet surveyed and 13.5 hours of caving.
