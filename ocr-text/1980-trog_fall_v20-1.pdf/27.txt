CALCULUS, BATSHIT, and BEER
The sun chased cloud-shadows across the red and gold slopes of Prices
Mountain as I gazed out the balconey at the dominating microwave tower, re-
membering the drunken foray some of us had made several nights previous.
Paul, Fran, Win, and Chuck had kept warm in the cab of the pick-up, while
John, Phillip, and I tried to avoid Hugh, who was in a lawn chair making ran-
dom attempts to hurl himself out of the bed as we rounded the curves on the
way up to the tower.
I was tempted, leaning there against the railing, to take a ride up in
the daylight, but the thought of work to be done and a dead inspection stick-
er deterred me. "Damn Calculus !" I thought as I went in. Why couldn't
Newton have spent his spare time under coconut trees instead of in apple or-
chards?!"
Being more enamored with nature's beauty than derivatives and formulas,
my mind wandered back to another day when I had watched the sun play across
the mountains, this time on the green leaves of summer....
Joe Zokaites, Bill Koerschner, and I were headed west on 460, on our way
to pick up Chuck and do some mapping in Pighole. With CCR drowning out Joe
and Bill's conversation in the front, I was taking in all that Mother Nature
had spread out for us to admire. It was the first I'd been in Blacksburg for
some time, and I was looking forward to returning semi-permanently in a month.
The environment itself was a physical rest from the pettiness and problems
of Winchester, Where I was working. The prospect of the underground and of
caving with experts again really cheered me. .
We picked up Chuck (after exchanging insults with Pat), signed the
Porterfield's register, and were soon at the yawning mouth of the cave.
Checking for cuts or heavily abraded spots, Joe and Chuck lowered the rope
while Bill and I got our rappeling rigs on. (Harnesses like that are sooo
much fun!)
Being eager to get into the cave, I was the first one down the rope, ex-
ercising more caution than usual since I didn't have a belay. Pighole is
where I had learned to rappel and it still had the power the to overwhelm me.
I took my time going down, enjoying the breathtaking ride. Bill was next,
then Chuck, and finally Joe.
This was the third mapping trip Chuck had led into Pighole and he had
some closure points to recheck just on the other side of what is now known
as Skunk Crawl. He and Joe reshot some Brunton readings, then we climbed up
to the lefthand balcony overlooking the floor of the entrance pit. Bill
stopped to answer some of Chuck's technical questions on the cave structure.
Following a passage that goes behind the pit, we came out on the righ thand
balconey, which is higher and more spacious than the other.
Joe located the last survey station from the previous trip, and with Bill
exploring, Joe reading Brunton, and me setting stations, Chuck finished the
sketch. Bill was shouting to us from some lead, so I followed Chuck until I
