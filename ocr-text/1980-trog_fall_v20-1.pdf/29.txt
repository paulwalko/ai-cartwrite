The Fallopian Tubes and Beyond
It was October 1979, and Bill Koerschner and myself were out at
Skydusky Hollow. This was to be a routine crossover trip through
Nowberry-Banes with Pete Sauvigne leading live people through from the
Banos end, and Bill and I leading three others from the Nowborry's side.
If anything seemed different about this crossover trip it was that
Koorschner, for all his davious thoughts on the Skydusky Cavo System,
had never been in Nowberry-Banes, the conter, and perhaps the key, to
the entire system..
As we made our way into Nowberry's and down Bill's rappel we figured
to do a fair amount of axploring. This promised to make our half of
tho trip a bit longer than Pete's half. The result was the mutiny of
one of our crew members whon wo finally met Pete's group.
With our number now reduced to four, we headed for the North Sub-
way which none of us had been to before. We checked out numerous leads
before finally finding the passage which led up to the extension area.
As we forged onward we crossed what appeared to be a significant, drain-
age divido. The passage was quite large, and something draining away
from the heart of Nowberry's had formed this. We continued ahead, al-
ways following the downs troam passages, until we were at last stopped
by a tricky 15 foot climb. While the others waited, I mado the climb
and continuod on from the other side. Shortly, I heard someone coming
up from behind. Suro enough, it was Philipo Balistor who had also found
the climb challenging, but not impossible.
We reached a muddy room, later to be callod the Meandor Room, and
noticed a single pair of footprints going across the floor. The pass-
age ended here with the trickle stream sinking into the floor. One
glance around the room showed only one six inch diameter hole up and
to the loft of where the stream senk. Putting my lamp up to this hole,
I saw the lamp flame being pullod in. By turning my car to the hole
it seemed I could hear a slight movement of running water or maybe it
was the sound of the trickle stream back behind me. Placing this in
my mind as a possible dig, we returned to the others.
After some more site seeing, we did the connection to Banes, climb-
ed the pit, and exited the cave, making it a ten hour trip.
Two weeks later, on Friday, November 9th, Jeff Hedges, Joey Fagan
and myself returned. We went in the Banes entrance and through the con-
nection to the North Subway. We arrived at the dig and took turns dig-
ging for a couple of hours. Being the smallest, I finally decided to
go for it and dug and squeezed my way forward in the gross oozing mud
for about 50 feet. After my second lamp failure I couldn't got my lamp
lit and, with my pack back in the meander roor I was forced to back out.
I was within two feet of digging to reach walking passage, Boyond I
could hear a big echo and the low roar of a largo stream. Moanwhile,
Joey had labeled the dig the Fallopian Tubes in honor of its sloaziness.
