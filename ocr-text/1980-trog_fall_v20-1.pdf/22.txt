THE FIND
Cold, damp, odious, evil, it waited. It was ancient, so very old it had
forgotten its origins. It had seen civilizations rise and fall, and had
known a time before the ascent of man. It had hunted the great lizards that
once inhabited the globe, and the creatures that predated even them.
Cowardly, it hid from the light of day and skulked in the shadows from
which it emerged very rarely, and only at night, to prowl and to feed. It
feared everything, but hated much, much more. Despising all life as a threat,
malefic, sinister, dark, and forboding, it had encountered man's progenitors
time and time again. Occasionally some fluke of anscestral memory would
bring its image to the forefront of the mind of a dreamer, and bring him
screaming, clawing, out of deepest sleep, remembering with abject terror only
the vaguest de tails of a hideous nightmare.
It feared man and his technology more than any creature it had encoun-
tered; it hated him with a deep and abiding passion that, by contrast, paled
all of the strongest of human emotions to frail shadows. It seethed and
basked in its abhorrence of humanity, planning in its twisted mind, hating.
It was Johnny who first found the cave, though Mike later insisted he
had known it was there all along. They were taking a shortcut through Flan-
der's woods on the way home from school (though both sets of parents had
sternly warned them against it).
The day before, Mike received in the mail a special curve-pitch base-.;
ball for which he had sent away three Frosted Flakes bo tops. He had thrown
an especially twisty curve with the oddly weighted ball, which had gone past
Johnny's outstretched fingers and into the bushes by the hill. Johnny, of
course, had gone right after it, unmindful of the damage that the brush was
doing to his new school clothes. His exclamation of delighted surprise
brought Mike scurrying in after him with the dexterity that only an eleven
year old can possess.
"A pirate's cave!" Mike exclaimed, on seeing his friend's discovery.
"I bet there's a million billion dollars worth of treasure in there." The
fact that they were at least one hundred miles from the nearest coast didn't
bother him at all.
"And skulls, and bones, and swords, and ghosts!" Johnny added, his
tastes leaning slightly more towards the macabre.
The ball had stopped before a three-foot square opening at the hill's
rocky, brush covered base. It was obvious, even to the youngsters, that a
grownup would probably never had made their discovery. The surrounding area
was so choked by brambles and small boulders that passage for anything larger
than a small boy was next to impossible. Besides, had anyone else known of
so interesting a phenomenon, then the boys would certainly have heard about
it, most likely in the form of an order to stay away from it, issued by cau-
tious parents.
A brief exploration of the opening reassured them that it was indeed a
cave, not just a small hollow in the rock. In fact, just a few feet in it
widened out enough that they could stand without hitting their heads. Mike,
who was not overly fond of the dark, was reluctant to proceed any further
without some sort of light. Since the next day was Saturday, they made a .
007, supersecret agent pact not to tell anybody of their find and to meet
back there right before breakfast.
