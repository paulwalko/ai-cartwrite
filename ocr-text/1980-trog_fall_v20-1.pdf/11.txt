even with the top of the waterfall, which was the 510 foot level.
76' to go! The fog and haze cleared away as we climbed above the
stream, and the top came into view. While Pete and I were paus-
ing to rest, the rope "popped" and dropped us an inch or so!
It was probably slipping off of a little nodule on the lip, but
Pete and I were up that rope like shots! Who the hell's tired?
Let's Go!! (A subsequent check of the rigging showed that all
was safe).
We packed our vertical gear, crawled around the top of the
pit, and headed for the beer. When we got to the canyon passage
crossing where we'd used a belay before, Stephens and I went across
first and then hauled everyone's packs across. Then Bill and I
headed for the "Warmup Pit" while the others were crossing, so we
wouldn't have all of us reaching the bottom of the climb at the
same time. Some of the ledges looked hairier than they had on
the way in (because we were tired), but we made it safely back
to the bottom of the Warmup. I was first up the 125 footer. This
was our last real obstacle to the outside, and I about ran up it!
Back in Virginia this would have been a fairly major drop - but
here it was just a piddly nuisance drop. When I'd run out of breath
I'd pause for a second and take off again. I just wanted it to
be over! Bill followed me up, and shortly afterwards Pete, Chuck
and Joey arrived and joined us at the top.
After coiling our rope and repacking our vertical gear we
headed back up the Ecstacy to the entrance - only this time we
didn't try to keep our feet dry â€¢ we almost ran up the middle of
the stream, being careful only to avoid "plunge pools". We re-
trieved the beer from the stream and exited the cave at 3:45 AM,
a 16 hour trip of ass kicking caving!
We felt terrific coming down the mountain - we were bruised,
battered, wobbly legged and exhausted, but we had made it! Back
at camp we opened many beers, too wound up to go to sleep, no
matter how exhausted we were. We must have been a sight to see,
the five of us in a circle around a beer can "fire" with a blanket
draped over all of us to keep the heat from a Coleman lantern in.
We finally went to sleep after the sun came up, and got about
4 hours of sleep. It became very hot after awhile, with the sun
beating on my tent. I took off the rest of my clothes and slept
as long as I could till it got too hot. At that point I jumped
naked out of the tent, ran with a yell across the camping area and
plunged into Bluebird Spring. That cold water woke me up in a
hurry, and felt really good - once I was out of it! Before we
left we'd all jumped in a bunch of times - the camp spot was so
neat we didn't want to leave.
But all good things must end, and so did this - in a very slow
and painfull manner: an eight hour drive through bleary eyes back
to the "real world".
