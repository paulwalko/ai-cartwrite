creased friction from the additional sharp bends. Secondly,
the construction material has a very low rate of heat dis-
sipation and could cause heat damage to a nylon rope. Third,
and finally, the cross piece between the "horns" of both de-
vices was too narrow, making the rope bend much too tightly.
All of these problems, plus the ones mentioned involving the
rigging of them combined to make a miserable design failure.
Don't let this discourage anyone from trying to improve
upon the designs currently used in caving equipment. Every-
thing we have today was developed by someone trying something
new, and it's usually been a caver's design which gained the
widest acceptance. The main thing to keep in mind is to al-
ways thoroughly test any new design or equipment before put-
ting it to the ultimate test underground.
Thanks to Pat Shorten for drawing these illustrations
and getting the experimental pieces made.
