Southwest. Another hiker described them as "long stalks with a cabbage
on top". Grounds els and bromeliads were about the only vegetation a-
round.
Very late in the day, we got to the 13,500 foot elevation Teliks
Hut. Already we were higher than either of us had over been before
without the aid of a 707, and we were really beginning to feel the ef-
fects of the altitude. Teleki Hut was a far cry from the huts at the
met station. It was a small, drafty tin building with very rudimentary
bunks and quite a bit of evidence of rats. It was crowded with hikers--
many of them miserable with altitudo sickness. The conversation was
lively with quite a cross section of people from many corners of the
world.
The following day we loft Toloki Hut for Top Hut at 15,700 feet.
Soon after leaving Teleki Hut we came to a large community of hiraxes.
A hirax is a very interesting little critter that looks much like a
groundhog, but really isn't even a rodent at all, having its own evol-
utionary branch. Someone told us that it has boon determined, based
on toe structure of some such, that the little fellow is the oldest
living relative of the elephant. They're quite gregarious, and I
couldn't help but wonder what sort of a pet they would make.
Soon the trail began to climb very steeply and we left all vegeta-
tion behind. The footing was mostly screo, and the order of business
became step, slide... step, slido... pant, pant, pant; then start over
again. It was a beautiful day though, and we were above most of the
clouds. The sun was nice and warm in the cool air, and the view was
tremondous. We got to the Top Aut early in the afternoon and rosted for
the rest of the afternoon. The altitude and the climb were a bit much
for our out of shape bods .
Bofore breakfast the next morning, wo headed for the top. Actually
we had to settle for climbing the third highest of Mt. Kenya's peaks,
16,355 foot Point Lonana. The two higher peaks were considerably more
technical and beyond the capabilities of aither ourselves or our gear.
Even so, the climb was quite exhilerating. What a sight, although we
wore disappointed at not being able to goe Mt. Kilamanjaro. It
seemed really bizarre to be walking on a glacier a scant six milos from
the equator. Climbing Mt. Kenya was an experience that neither of us
expects to be able to repeat any time soon. If you ever happen to find
yourself in that far off corner of the world, I would recommend that
you give it a go.
