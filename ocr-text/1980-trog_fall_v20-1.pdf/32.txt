Finally, on September 20th, Bill, Bon, Bill Shipman and I returned
to Nowborry's. Again we took a crowbar and headed through the Fallop-
ian Tubes. We started mapping at the pool crawls and continued up the
trunk on the other side. While the others mapped a side lead, I went
up to the windy rock pile and bogan moving rock. Finally there was
onough space to move into a small alcove. There was room for air and
a few bats, but the breakdown was sandstone and looked hopeless.
As darkness was falling on the surface the survey finally reached
the rock pile. Numerous bats began to fly in and out of the pilo, mak-
ing the last low survey shots a drag. If we were getting air flow from
Spring Hollow why were there so many bats? The bat population of Spring
Hollow is rathor limited. It seemed that there had to be a surface on-
trance somewhere way above tho rock pile.
Wo loft the cave with 1500 feet; the survey was finished along with
13 hours of caving. Nowberry'g now stands at 4.9 miles. Could this
upper passage be the old Paleo-downstream of Spring Hollow? One
thing for gure is that the largo stream and trunk is the present down-
stream of Spring Hollow. This has beon confirmed by recont dye tracing.
Yes, Nowberry's doos hold tho koy to at least part of the system, and
the east side 18 hydrologically connected.
