A CLIMB UP MT. KENYA
Mt. Kenya is a crazy place. It rises out of the flat, arid equa-
torial plains of East Africa to an altitude of 17,058 feet, producing
its own weather in the process. Its lower flanks are covered by lush
jungles while alpine type meadows occur further upslope and finally the
summit is rock and glacier.
Jean and I began our hike up Mt. Kenya on Christmas Eve last year
from the Naru Maru Youth Hostel, near the mountain's base. Together with
Phoebe Allen, a Canadian girl word met earlier in our travels, we hitch-
ed a ride up to the entrance of the Mt. Kenya National Park. After
dispensing with the entrance formalities, we started walking up the road
to what they called the "met station", six miles into the park and at
an altitude of about 10, on feet. The road wound its way steadily
Upward through the jungle-- quite a contrast from the opon plains further
down. The clouds hover constantly around the mountain and produce an
abundance of rainfall in this area. We hoped to see some animal life
along this stretch, but as it turned out, about all we saw were brief
glimpses of colobus monkies as they cavorted and chattered in the trees
close to the road. We hoped to see an elephant as there were numerous
elophant-size droppings in the road, but none appeared. During a rest
break, Phoebe disappeared into the brush next to the road to relieve hor-
self only to come scrambling back seconds later, yanking up her pants with
a look of shoar terror on her face. "Something growled at mo!" We very
gingerly pokod back into the brush, but the growlor had either left or
he was keeping a low profile. Perhaps it was just as well.
None too soon we got to the met station as it was beginning to rain.
Actually, the met station is more than a meteorological station. There
are huts with bunks and cooking facilities as well as picnic areas.
It is where the road onds and the trail begins. Many of the touris ty
types with cars come here to spend a night while others drive this far
and then hike further with porters carrying their belongings. At
about three dollars a day, porters are not a bad deal, but we didn't feel
like playing the role of the "great white hunter" with a string of boar-
ers, so we shouldered our own loads.
Early Christmas morning, we parted company with Phoebe at the met
station and started climbing towards Teleki Hut. Wo soon left the jungle
and entered an area called the Mt. Kenya vertical bog. We had heard
horror stories of people falling in muck up to their waists. We were
quito apprehensive! As it turned out however, if you really work at it,
you could get wet up to your knees. But with a little caro, only your
boots need get wot. It was a lot of work though, and progress was slow.
The climb was steep and we were beginning to get out of breath with the
altitude. Soon the clouds rolled in around us and it was impossible
to rest without becoming cold. After lunch the trail leveled and foot-
ing was better, the ground becoming rockier and the vegetation changing.
All around were strange plants 6 or 8 feet tall called grounds els, In
a way their shape was reminiscent of that of organ pipe cacti of the
