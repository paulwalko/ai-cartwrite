ELLISON'S
As the time for the Elison's trip grew closer (Early May),
I found it ever more on my mind. I was excited by what prom-
ised to be a spectacualar cave. Not only did it have the deep-
est drop north of Mexico (Fantastic Pit, 586 ft), but once on
the lower levels there were promises of spectacular gypsum cry-
stal formations as icing on the cake. I was also "psyching"
myself for what lay ahead in the way of vertical work.
Talked to Pete Thursday night. He'd talked to "Smoky"
Cauldwell in Georgia, the weather was good (not too much water
over the drop), and Elison's was GO! Pete Sauvigne, Bill Step-
hens, Chuck Shorten, Joey Fagan and myself met in the parking
lot outside of Smyth shortly before noon on Friday, and were on
the road around one o'clock.
We partied heartily all the way to Georgia. Joey and I
took our cars, and we traded passengers and drivers all down
the road, getting more and more excited about the trip. We
arrived in Lafayette, Ga. as it was getting dark, picked up
the key to the campground, bought some more beer, and set
up camp at the base of Pigeon Mountain. (If you go to Tennes-
see or Georgia, bring your own beer - the cheapest we could
find there was $3,25 a six pack:)
Our camping spot was right next to Bluebird Spring, a
"blue hole" about 6 feet deep with two underwater cave pas-
sages emptying into the side of it. These passages are the
lower end of Blison's, where the water drains out of it (a
resurgence). Pete took off his clothes and jumped in while
we held flashlights. Although Georgia caves and cave water
are several degrees higher than Virginia, the water was still
at or below 60Â°, and nobody followed Pete. He dove into the
passage entrances with a waterproof flashlight and gave us a
good show.
We were all asleep by midnight, well aware we were going
to need lots of rest and energy for the upcoming trip. We
awoke about 8 AM, but by the time we'd eaten, arranged the gear
and hiked 3/4 of a mile up Pigeon Mountain to the entrance, it !
was 11:15. We stashed some beer in the entrance stream for when
we returned, and then we were in Elison's!
The "Ecstacy", a walking stream passage, was just inside
the entrance. We followed it for 20 or 30 minutes till we got
to the top of the 125 foot "Warm Up Pit". Pete rigged a piece
of PMI to 3 ceiling bolts and down we went.
