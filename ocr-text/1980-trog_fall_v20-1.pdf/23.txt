It awoke, angry. Some thing had moved nearby, disturbing it. It had
slept for a long time, but for a creature with a life that spanned millenia,
exactly how long was immaterial. It shifted its nauseating bulk with an obo
scene sucking sound and sifted the still air for scents. Faint traces of the
human smell came to it and it recalled the creature that went along with the
odor. Its anger swelled and it was almost prompted to seek the source of the
scent, but caution and fear held it in place. It was very clever. It had an
intelligence at least equal to that of man's, but unlike man's mayfly-like
existence, it had had countless centuries to store knowledge and to brood on
it. It remembered the monkey-like curiosity of the humans and reasoned they
would return. It would wait; it was good at that.
The trick of getting away from parents for the day was easily performed.
Mike simply told his parents that he was going over to Johnny's house, while
Johnny told his that he was going over to Mike's. The intervening night had
seemed to drag out forever to the boys, so bright and early the next morning
they set out with anticipation, equipped with their fathers' flashlights and
their own imaginations.
Both had kept their pact, despite great temptation to the contrary.
Mike's little sister, Mary, had guessed that something was up from Mike's I-
know-something-you-don't-know. attitude, but had no way of prying the infor-
mation out of him. She whined, cajoled, begged, threatened to tell their
parents (exactly what, she wouldn't say), but to little avail. All she could
get out of him were some obscure comments about Flander's woods. Being too
young to make forays on her own, she was forced to resign herself to watching
the departing back of her brother as he headed off on his exiting adventure,
carrying the mysteriously necessary flashlight.
The boys quickly made their way through the brush to the cave entrance.
At the opening, they made an equipment check of their lights and renewed
their pledge to each other; they were going to split anything they might
find fifty-fifty. Johnny, being the bolder of the two, entered the cave
first. Mike was quick to follow though, as nothing in the world can keep a
young boy away from a prospective adventure, not even a gloomy cave.
The interior of the cave did indeed open up, as they had discovered the
day before. It was approximately five feet high and twice that in width.
The walls glistened with a faintly luminescent slime that appeared in patches
and trails all down its length. The cave extended at a downward incline for
as far ahead as their lights would allow them to see. The air was cool and
damp, musty and still, as if it hadn't been stirred for a long time.
After the initial excitement and suspense, they found themselves a lit-
tle disappointed that there were no heaps of treasure lying about in plain
view. A conference was held in hushed whispers, which seemed appropriate in
this place. They reassured each other that the pirate's gold must br further
on in; it made good sense that the pirates would have wanted to hide their
booty as well as possible. Urging each other on, with Johnny slightly in the
lead, they moved deeper into the cave, the beams of their flashlights weakly
illuminating the darkness.
They hadn't gone more than ten paces when they noticed the smell. Once,
a rat had swallowed some poison and had crawled behind the waterheater in
Mike's basement and died. This smell reminded him vaguely of that, but it
was not quite the same; it was somewhere worse. He felt goosebumps begin to
form on his skin and he started to shiver.
The further in they went, the more the odor thickened. Mike could have
