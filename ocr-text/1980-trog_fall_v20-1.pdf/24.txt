sworn he heard a slithering sound, but the noise they were making made it im-
possible for him to be sure. When they stopped at his insistence to listen
for it, nothing could be heard but their own excited breathing.
"Johnny," Mike whispered, "I'm scared. Let's go home."
"Don't be silly," Johnny scolded, "Don't you want the pirate's trea
sure?"
"Not any more," Mike answered. "Let's go get my dad first; this place
gives me the creeps."
"Then we'll have to split it three ways instead of two. Come on, let's
just look a little further," Johnny urged. With that he headed onward, hold-
ing his light at arms length with one hand and his other hand over his mouth
and nose.
"Sure smells bad in here," he called back to Mike, who followed very
reluctantly.
After about fifty more paces of steady descent, the cave came to an
abrupt end. Mike looked relieved and Johnny disappointed, as they searched
the back wall of the cave for any further openings. They were very careful
not to touch anything, as the cave walls were thoroughly covered with the
slime this far back.
"Damn," Johnny said, "no treasure!"
Mike nodded and choked out a request that they go get some fresh air.
Johnny signalled agreement and kicked out at the ooze coated wall with his
tennis shoe as he turned...
It was very, very clever. It had played this game many times in the
past. Few had seen it and lived to remember. It knew that if it stretched
itself out and carefully hugged the wall...
"Cave-in!" Johnny yolled. Mike wasn't so suro. On television cave-ins
always had rocks falling from the roof accompanied with lots of noise. Here,
just the wall seemed to be collapsing and it was doing it without making any
noise at all.
It heaved itself up, twisting its grotesquely misshapen form. A vision
of unclean wriggling death, it turned towards the boys. Snapping fangs,
gnashing incisors, scratching pincers and claws, it was a horrible, festoring
picture of insanity.
The boys' lights caught it and illuminated it fully as it moved. Mike
screamed and covered his eyes. He felt his bowels move and the front of his
pants grow damp. Johnny turned, ran face first into the rear wall of the
cave, and was mercifully knocked unconscious.
It loved to play with its food. It reveled in the blood of the kill.
It gloated, and still how it hated! It had almost forgotten the taste of
meat, so long had it slept. It fed, digested, and waited.
Mary told the searchers that she had heard her brother mention Flander's
woods and that he had taken a flashlight with him. Johnny's father also re-
ported a flashlight missing. The search party was the largest ever organized
in the area. Given the evidence, the state police reasoned that they should
be on the lookout for a cave.
If they were very, very lucky, they wouldn't find it.
