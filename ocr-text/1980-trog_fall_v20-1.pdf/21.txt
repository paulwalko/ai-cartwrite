GO FOR IT!
Another "Old Timer's" has come and gone, and once again,
VPI has walked away with all the prizes in the Speleo-Olympics -
a fact of which we can deservedly be proud. But possibly not
without a hidden cost. For there were no "new" VPI faces among
the contestants.
While I wish I could say that the following observations are
original with me, they were first brought to my attention by Don
Davison (D2) at OTR. For the newer people who don't know Don,
he is a former VPI member who has, among other things, developed
many of the techniques used in the Club (and NSS) today. He was
also chairman of the NSS Safety and Techniques Committee for sev-
eral years. What follows then are partly Don's observations and
partly my reflections on same.
The "Speleo-Olympics" were originally conceived in the spirit
of having a good time (as is all of OTR!). It was a chance for
cavers to try out their techniques and good naturedly compete with
each other - primarily for fun. It didn't matter whether you won,
hearing the yells of encouragement from your friends as they con-
vinced you that you could climb that last 30 feet (even when you
were ready to quit), and then their cheers as you made it - that
was enough. Then, as it should always be, you were not competing
primarily against others but against yourself. If you did better
this year than last, then you had bettered yourself - never a cause
for anything but pride!
Of course, when you get a large active group of cavers such
as VPI is, it's only natural that a number of them will end up
winning a lot of the prizes. I certainly am not against that!
A certain amount of competition is healthy and causes you to push
yourself farther than you would on your own. So by all means,
compete! Let's keep showing that VPI is on the ball!
But the point that needs to be made is, you don't need to feel
you have a possibility of winning a prize in order to enter. If
you're giving it your all, people will encourage you whether you're
in first place or last. And if you can be better than you have been
before, then you've won a bigger prize than any that can be handed
out Sunday night:
A group like VPI has never survived nor grown by having a few
people do things while everyone else sat back. We grow strong only
by involvement of everyone. By letting only those "stars" who will
win represent VPI, we are in danger of doing to the Speleo-Olympics
what Little League has done to sand lot baseball. Think about it,
and next time OTR comes around, get your gear together and GO FOR IT!
