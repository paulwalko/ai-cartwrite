garbage gas and methane in my face! Retreating momentarily,
I managed to gasp some fresh air. Spurred by their resis-
tance, I buried my nose in the shoulder of my jacket and at-
tacked the flank. A fierce battle ensued; bits of old sub-
buns, bad tomato, and sacrificed Browns flew in various di-
rections. It was tough going for a while, but I somehow in-
carcerated the entire group. I lurched weakly to the opening
of the dumpster and draped myself across the paling sur-
rounding the quieting battle zone, gulping in the sweet
fresh air of victory and freedom, thankful beyond words for
my miraculous escape.
We finished sorting, and having literally flattened the
unruly pfcis, turned our backs on the gore-littered scene,
leaving some early-morning employees of Daddy's Money gaping
in disbelief.
Paul was driving (we wanted live Pow's, not shattered
remains) and decided to reconnoiter Macado's. We had stop-
ped at the four-way on Draper Road, yielded around once,
when Paul gave voice to a sound reminiscent of a climaxing
bordello client. I wondered what was up, and with a tremb-
ling hand he directed my attention-
"Over (sigh) there (pant)! The (drool) blonde (slaver)
in the (unbelievingly) JADE GREEN FORD PICKUP!! (collapse) "
She seemed to be going our direction (or we, hers), so
we naturally follwed her, Paul continuing his bliss-tinged
commentary.
"I don't (Gasp!) believe it! (Stare, stare!) It's an
F100, same year as (throb, throb) mine! Just a few months
later (Pant, pant)!"
"How do you know?" I asked reverently.
"Square headlights (slobber)!"
I wasn't sure that he was referring to the truck with
this last- I hadn't gotten a good look at the girl.
"She's got an optional (PANT) step bumper!"
That really threw me, until he added, in angelic tones,
"And a 'Bluegrass is Finger Pickin' Good" bumper sticker on
it!" (The sticker was in plain sight and confirmed my feel-
ings that he referred to the truck, and not the girl, with
his cryptic remarks.)
