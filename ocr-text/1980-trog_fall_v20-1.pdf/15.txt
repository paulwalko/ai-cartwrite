FOUR-WAY STOP DILEMMA
"I think we just found a bunker, Dave. I can see a lot
of them from here."
"Oh, yeah? Well, let me grab a bag and we'll see how
many we can capture. It does lookpretty good!"
Paul and I jumped eagerly into the twin dumpsters, hav-
ing taken only a small number of enemy personnel in the two
previous sorties earlier in the day. We'd managed to appre-
hend 10 regular-army infantry, 25 Hessians, and no armoured
pfc's, so we were glad for what turned out to be a large di-
vision comprised of all three.
We found them to be a determined and devious lot, with
several nasty tricks up their sleeves. We attacked them with
cries of "You'll not escape! I see you under that rotten head

the Browns!" (The Browns are a cowardly bunch, lending help
only when they think they won't be discovered, but they can
be a real nuisance. However, we passed them by for the real
fighters.) Some of the Hessians, in their desperation to es-
cape, commited suicide rather than face the humiliation of a
trip to the reclamation center. Others burrowed into a half-
baked pizza (with topping!), getting themselves so entangled
that we decided they were worse off where they were, and of-
fered no release.
Paul soon secured his dumpster and retired to the pick-
up bed to sort and classify the prisoners according to con-
centration camp destination. I was still encountering pockets
of resistance, and was twice forced to call for reinforce-
ments from Paul. On the whole, things were going well, and I
was whistling as I went from one defense pod to another, rip-
ping them open and plucking forth the cowering, terror-stric-
ken occupants.
I had nearly decided the area clear of defenders, when
I spied one last pod, well hidden beneath some discarded sup-
ply containers. I advanced with a shout of triumph, tore at
the fragile pod walls with malicious glee... and nearly faint-
ed! I reeled backwards, retching uncontrolledly as the des-
pairing troops inside released wave after noxious wave of
