EDITOR'S COLUMN
As I sit here writing this column, I still find myself marveling at what
I have gotten into this time, It all started at the end of spring quarter,
at which time I was approached by the former Trog editor, Pat Shorten, about
being the Trog editor the following school year. The fact that I was in a
drunken stupor probably had no effect on my decision, I feel relatively sure.
Well, summer has a way of making students forget things, and I soon forgot my
promise to Pat. Old Timers soon rolled around, and again I was asked if I
would be editor for the Trog. Again, I feel that my drunken state on this
occasion did not alter my decision. I have to admit, though, that I was a
bit surprised when I was reminded that I was the new Trog editor, when I was
in a more functional state,
So everyone is probably thinking, by this time, that I have regrets
about taking this post. At first I did, but when it really got down to put-
ting out the Trog, I got excited... I found it stimulating...I...I... Well
let it suffice to say that I got into it. From talking to people in the club,
I realized that the Trog is a very important function to them. It is an im-
por tant way for members to communicate ideas and news.
Anyway, enough of this bat guano. I would like to present the Fall 180
Tech Troglodyte. I hope everyone finds it anvenjoyable issue. At this time
I would like to thank the following people for their help on this issue: Pat
Shorten, Boo Croft, Dave Shantz, Pam Buzas, and Sue Heazel. Without their
help, this Trog would be next year coming out. I would also like to thank
those who gave me material for the Trog: keep it coming.
I would like to conclude by encouraging participation by everyone. If
you can write, please submit an article. If you feel that you can't write
but you have some ideas concerning articles or the Trog in general, bend my
ear. Well, I've rambled on enough for now. I've got to save some up for
the next issue.
