Two Experimental Designs for
Competition Rappelling Devices
Every summer, around the middle of July, the creative
minds of VPI cavers turn towards the competitions at old
Timer's. The competitions are not only fun, but educational
and profitable as well. (Just ask Richard Cobb and Bill Ste.
phens.) Having been a competitor in the speleoympics before,
this year I sought to win the prussick-rappel-prussick con-
test with my own specially-made rappel device.
The prussik-rappel-prussik contest consists of a 20-30
foot fixed rope which a caver must prussik up, change to rap-
pel device and rappel down, then prussik back up to the top.
All this is done while a judge times the caver. Winning times
last year were around 1 minutes.
Obviously, some special gear and techniques are neces-
sary to win this event. A knot must be quick to tie and un-
tie as well as easy to slide on the rope and tight-gripping.
Sounds contradictory, doesn't it? The rappel device must be
quick to rig in and out, but must be safe for a controlled
rappel. That's where my experimental designs come in.
The first design (fig. 1) that I tried was called the
"Horseshoe Crab." The main idea here was to make a device
that could be useful for the competition and actual caving
situations. Being tired of carrying a 14-inch rack through
most caves to do a rappel of 100 feet or less, I wanted a
more compact piece of equipment. However, I didn't wish to
give up the adjustability of a rack. Thus, the plan: Use the
lower portion of the device as a figure-eight and use the
"horns" to give an additional wrap if needed. This didn't
work for reasons that I'll explain, but the real disaster
is that it worked just as poorly in the other configuration,
the one needed for competition. Here, the rope was to be fed
in a bight through the large hole and wrapped around the
"horns" as in the longhorn rappel device. The problem was
that the rope actually bent around and back over itself,
causing a nylon-on-nylon rubbing action. The only way it
seems I can make this device useful is to cut the "horns"
off and use it as an ordinary figure-of-eight device.
The second device (fig. 2) made no pretense at trying
to be a useful caving device; its sole design purpose was to
be fast getting on and off the rope. It suffered a single
drawback: it threatened on an experimental 20 ft. rappel to
come off the rope a little too easily, about 20 ft. off the
ground! It was a modification of the longhorn which I thought
would be slightly quicker to rig, but the placement of the
"horns" on the side proved to be altogether wrong. When feed-
ing rope up through the device the rope would come around
the lower horn and **POOF** you're gone!
There were three main probleme common to each device.
First, the devices were cut from bar stock 3/8 inch steel.
This gave square edges for the rope to pass over, giving in-
