came to a three foot step across a 40 foot void. I lost my nerve and backed
up to let Joe past. He mumbled some thing about short people while crawling
across into the lead. I went up to look at it again, the other three having
map ped the lead to a quick end. Chuck said it wasn't even a fat chance,
Shantz, and they all came back across with exaggerated nonchalance, just to
make me feel good.
We poked back through the passage connecting the balconies, futilely
looking for any unexplored leads, and resumed mapping in some small, slightly
muddy stuff. This came out in a room that connects the left balcony and the
passage leading to the Empire Ledge, which overlooks Hess' Hollow and the Mud
Bridge. Opting for a rest, we sat down to a snack of pressed ham, sardines,
Vienna sausages (yum, yum), and Joe's ever-present Tootsie Rolls.
Soon we were back to the Brunton and the muddy tape, outlining the room
and mapping out some of the possible leads. One turned out to be a real nice
walking passage that went fifty feet before turning a corner and mudding up.
We decided to quit before the Empire Ledge, stopping part-way down a slope
that led to a black abyss that looked to require at least a belay, more like-
ly a cable ladder. Joe tossed some clumps of mad, down to estimate the depth
while Bill perched on a boulder, peering over the edge, looking for all the
world like a hungry vulture surveying the landscape.
Joe and Bill ambled towards the Wild Cat Run, giving Chuck and me time
to put away the notes and tape. Joe led us to the far side of the Mud Bridge,
where we made sure the Queen had enough bath water, and poked around some of
the passages there. We went on through the large breakdown blocks into the
guano room, which looked as if some giant moles had been digging the shit up
for fertilizer.
At the small end of the room, I slithered up the chimney tiles that line
the back entrance. I was concerned about the widening crack in the lower one;
it looked none too stable. Hooking my pack onto my foot, I pushed the door
up with my helmet. Joe handed up the others' packs, and I stood making help-
ful comments about tall people as he struggled with his oversized legs. Bill
and Chuck got out easily enough and discussed the possibility of improving
the log retaining walls. After de-reigging the rope, we went back to Chuck
and Pat's for beer and spaghetti.
....I came to my senses with an empty beer in my hand and the calculus
book open in front of me, like a death warrant. Sensing the shock to my sys-
tem, I got another beer to compensate and sat down to work. Even with calcu-
lus, I decided, it's good to be back in Blacksburg.
