Gaping Hole Cave System
On the Friday before Labor Day of this year, I met with Kerry Latimore
and Mark Conover in Kerry'g San Jose apartment. From there, we drove north
through McCloud, and then followed some logging roads to an area where
trip organizer Dave McClurg said to make camp, in the vicinity of Mount
Shasta.
The ground was covered by palm-sized chips of lava, and finding an un-
broken flat slab to sleep on wasn't easy. The McClurgs avoided this prob-
lem by sleeping in their van, in which they arrived at around midnight. In
my opinion, the nght air was too chilly for 'sleeping under the stars',
'cause I froze roy ....S off.
The next morning, Kerry and I poked around the site and located a coup-
le of windows into the lava tubes, as well as short collapsed sections of
tubes.
By 10:00, Bruce Rogers, Charmaine Legge, Ed Strauch, and Pete Bosted
had arrived, completing the exploring party. McClurg and Rogers held a
powwow to tell us about the Gaping Hole system, and lava tubes in gener-
al.
Lava tubes form when molten lava flows through valleys in the pre-
flow terrain and solidifies on top, forming a hard crust over a still.
molten center. When the lava stops flowing, the liquid center runs out,
leaving a hollow cavity which may be several miles long. With time, the
ceiling may collapse in those areas where it is too wide to support its
own weight. When this occurs, an open, rubble-choked trench forms.
Gaping Hole is one segment of a tube which originates at Giant Crater
and which one may follow continuously for about 15 miles. Near the cra-
ter, much of the ceiling has collapsed, leaving miles of open trench.
Farther downstream' sections have maintained their ceilings, and it is
these sections that constitute the caves we were to visit.
. At about noon, everyone was ready and we headed to the walk-in en-
trance. The lava, which when liquid was full of gas bubbles, is pock-
marked and very abrasive, which is hard on skin and clothing, but easy
to climb on. The ceilings of the caves range in thickness from a:few
inches to 70 feet. In several places, two levels of parallel tubes
exist- each caused by a different flow. We walked the length of Gaping
Hole Cave to the foot-thick moss floor of Double Arches Window, near
the northern end of the cave. The going was easy, and we had no trouble
deciding which way to go, for lava tubes rarely have any side passages.
Pete and I went beyond Double Arches to the end of the cave, and then
had a quick look into Shovel Cave. By then, Saturday was over,
Sunday moming, we went to Jot Dean Cave to meet Paul and Suzanne
Lushkin and Dave and Louise Squire of the Stanislaus Grotto. Froin Jot
Dean we drove to a point near Giant Crater, where we intended to follow
the main trench to find new caves in its 'unexplored' regions.
Our practice of not bringing any caving gear along, so as to enhance
our chances of finding a cave, paid off when Ed Strauch poked his head
into a window, and found that it went! Everyone piled in to look around,
using only flashlights for illunination. Pete, Mark, and Paul surveyed,
and the rest of us tried to figure out from which crater the lava had
flowed in forming the cave.
After finding some 300 feet of cave, we assumed that the cave had
ended and exited. Pete, Mark, and Paul were nowhere to be found. After
