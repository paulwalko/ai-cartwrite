We gave up for the day and hoaded out after an 8.5 hour trip. Wold
missed the Cave Club meeting and a day of school as woll.
On December 15th Jeff Hedges, Win Wright and I decided to return
to the Fallopian Tubes. With much screwing around, we finally entored
Newberry's at 4:15 in the aftornoon. Not knowing exactly where it was
or how to do it, we looked around for the Devil's Staircase, the free
climb bypass of the 160 foot Bill's rappol. Once down, we headed up
the North Subway armed with an army shovel and 125 feet of bluewater
for a towline.
After somo initial widening of the dig, I pushed through with the
towline tied to my ankle. I dug through the last fow feet and found
myself in a small, alcove with a small hole leading to a roaring stream.
I pulled my pack through on the towline and sent the shovel back for the
next person. Unable to wait any longer, I popped through the remain-
ing hole and rolled down the mud bank of a large room. Wow! Before
me lay the largost stream in the entire system. Was this the master
trunk?
Returning to the dig, I heard Win squirming along. Howovor, I had
only dug things large enough for myself, and towards the end I had
basically forced my way through with minimal digging. Win, naturally,
was soon quite stuck, and though he had the shovel he couldn't begin to
dig anymoro. Oh well, one choico remained. I crawled in and took the
shovel from him, digging things out a bit larger. Then I backed out
and we both grabbed hold of the towline. We pulled like hell and at last
Win popped through like a cork. Jeff, being considerably larger than
either of us, opted to remain on the other side.
Downs troam at the far end of the large room was a big torminal si-
phon lake. Ups troam we wont about 700 feet before being forcod to get
in the water. I waded upstream in thigh deep water until a six inch
air space was encountered. A definite lack of air flow failod to
suck me through this without a wetsuit. We turned around and headed
up a rubble slope into the only significant sido load.
Climbing up high, we crawlod around some loose looking breakdown
before finally backing off, but something was cortainly up there. Wo
returned to the dig. Win soomed to lack a whole lot of enthusiasm and
I wasn't about to let him go back through first, just in caso ho couldn't
fit. As it onded up wo had little problem getting out and we exitod
the cavo into the cold moming darkness at 5:45 AM after a 13.5 hour
trip.
The stream wo had found appeared to be coming from the east side
of the system, and was certainly large enough to be carrying the com-
binod wator of both Spring Hollow and Bano's Spring.
After a few hours of spoleo-seminar, we watched the sun rise and
hiked down the ridge to Paul Ponloy's to compare finds with Ed Dovino's
two day mapping crow.
