the floor in mounds. In one place it was piled into a sizeable
formation called the "Cottage Cheese", which is exactly what
it looked like.
But the most incredible part of the cave was "Angel's Para-
dise", located just below the Creamery. It is a small room full
of tufts of "Angel Hair", which were clusters or bundles of hair
like white gypsum crystals. The crystals were 3 or more inches
long, and so fine they'd wave in the slightest breeze. The floor
and wali swere so thick in Angel Hair that it looked like someone's
lawn that needed mowing.
By this time it was about 8 or 9 PM, and we knew that we had
to start heading back. We didn't know how long it would take,
since we weren't too sure of the route back, though we knew we
would find it eventually. We actually made it back to the bottom
of the drop in fairly good time, though we did make a bunch of
wrong turns. But it would have been a lot longer if it hadn't
been for Stephens - his sense of direction in a cave is incredible,
Long after the rest of us were totally confused, Stephens still
seemed to know what general part of the cave we were in and which
direction to go. At any rate, it was about midnight before we
had arrived at the bottom of the drop and anyone was ready to
climb.
Chuck and Joey climbed in tandem, taking about 45 minutes to
reach the top. Bill went up next by himself (we put the solo
climber in between a group above and a group below, in case any
problems arose). Bill made the climb in just over 30 minutes,
I was really getting ragged out and wanted some rest before
the climb, and I also knew how easy it would be to get hypother-
mic in the spray and nist from the waterfall. I laid behind a
boulder, tucked up inside of a garbage bag with a carbide lamp,
and actually got a short nap. I awoke to find several holes
burned in the garbage bag, and was glad I hadn't awakened in
flames:
Finally, it was time for Pete and I to climb, I took bottom
man so I could hang my pack about 10 feet below me and out of
my way. I was also trying out a new design for my climbing rig,
with my shoulder weight carried by a S.A.R.A. pulley instead of
a Gibbs (but with a third Gibbs as a backup). Ideally, this was
to have reduced the shoulder drag, and as a result, the climbing
effort. The trouble was, I was so tired climbing the rope that
I couldn't tell if it did any good or not. Both Pete and I were
feeling really ragged on the rope. I was glad for the fact that
we were surrounded by fog, and no one had a light on the bottom.
Visually, we could have been on a 50 or 100 foot drop, (you couldn't
see any farther), and it took a lot of the psychological pressure
off (which is much worse when you're tired). Our rest stops be-
came more and more frequent as we neared the top. Finally we came
