Greetings From The Podium....
First on the agenda for this column is to remind everybody about caving
in the winter where bats hibernate. So little as a change in temperature
from your lamp and body heat can awaken a hibernating bat. Depending on the
severity of the winter and other conditions, the bat might not have enough
food stored to live through the winter. Just about every cave is going to
have bats, but the ones that we should particularly avoid visiting are the
North Subway in Newberry's and, of course, Greenville Saltpeter. If you have
a question about a certain cave, ask Janet Queisser.
Another item of importance is that with winter comes wet conditions ;
the walk up to the cave may require more work than driving, but it's worth
the effort to avoid starting erosion ditches in the landowner's field.
Now for some general information. The project to build a fence around
BEING
New Castle Murderhole was postponed due to the ground" too hard and dry to
sink a fence post. The project will be rescheduled as soon as conditions are
favorable. **There will be a New Years party at Buckwheat and Nancy's again
this year in Rapidan, Va. Give them a call for directions at (703) 672-3537.
**The annual banquet will be held on February 14; dinner is at 5:30 at
Squires Student Center and the party is at the VFW Hall in Radford. If you

and any help would be welcomed. Information on the event will be sent out

getting our publication to associate members, but we now have our guano to-
gether. So tell the SIVTAÄŒers to pay their dues so they can get a Trog,
please.** The Cave Club almost became a can collecting club this fall, but
we are richer thanks to the Miller contest and everyone's efforts.
