The passage from the bottom of the Warm Up Pit to the
"Attic Room" (top of Fantastic) was more difficult. There were
a number of straddles and a few ledges to negotiate, with expos-
ure of anywhere from 30 to 70 feet. One place was difficult e-
nough that we used a hauling line to get our packs across, and
then belayed each other.
Finally, we were at the Attic Roon. That 25' diameter hole
in the floor was "Fantastic Pit"! The last obstacle was a crawl
around the edge of the pit. The crawl wasn't tight, and wide e-
nough that there was no real fear of falling, but just knowing
that that blackness at your right elbow didn't end for almost
600 feet...
Once through the crawl we came upon a large pile of PMI
rope with one end rigged to a boulder (Smoky leaves a rope
permanently rigged at the drop). We stood around for a while,
freaking out on the fact that we were standing at the top of
Fantastic Pit! We dropped the inevitable rocks into the dark-
ness, it took them an average of 7 seconds to hit the bottom!
But after three or four seconds you could hear a sound like a
distant train - the sound of air rushing around the rock!
(Really Impressive!) Nobody was feeling any too cocky right
then: We stood around talking about what a neat idea it would
be to go back down the mountain and drink beer in the sun all
day; the Hell with this:
We lowered the end of the rope down the drop, carefully in-
specting every inch of it as it went, Chuck was first to go,
since he had an electric lamp. We didn't know how heavy the water
flow was, and too much water would drown a carbide lamp. He also
put on a plastic (Miller) bag to stay dry, just in case. As he
got closer and closer to the moment, you could just see "Oh Shit!"
written all over him. After a few moments negotiating the edge
(with everyone telling him it was nice knowing him), he was on
his way.
About 10 minutes later we heard "OFF..............., ROPB..
.......000.000..DRY ................D............R...........Y".
Communication is difficult on that long of a drop, especially
with running water. Each syllable had to be spoken separately,
with time for the echoes to die down before the next one. He
was telling us that we wouldn't get wet. Actually, even if the
waterflow had been somewhat heavier, Chuck would have been the
only person to get wet, since he would have been able to hold
the end of the rope so that all who followed him could stay dry.
As it was, even Chuck stayed dry.
I was second on the rope, I mentioned something about go-
ing home as I was backing down the hole. Stephens just clapped
me on the shoulder and said "Oh, Wow." Then I was off! The rope
