ten minutes or so, we heard yells from some distance. When we ran to the
source, it was a window with the missing cavers at the bottom of it.
Mark and I climbed down and explored as Paul and Peto surveyed behind
us. The lava cut my hands and knees badly, but I didn't particularly mind-
after all, I was in virgin caveWe found many big tree roots growing
through the thin, porous ceiling, and down to the floor. After a tight
crawlway and 700 more feet of stooping and duckwalking, the tube finally
came to an end. In toto, the cave is about 2000 feet long, which is pretty
good for a lava tube!
After the excitement of Root Loop Cave, as we named it, we trucked on
over to Giant Crater. The crater is huge, between 1/4 and 1/3 mile in di-
ameter, and 200-300 feet deep, and choked with mabble that has fallen in
from the sides. From there we headed down the trench, Pete and I ranging
ahead with a walkie-talkie, trying to reach the unexplored part of the
trench before it got too late. We turned back at 6:30, waware that we
were only 1 section from the unexplored region.
On Monday we decided to visit some ice caves, so we headed to Iceplug
Cave and 3 Level Ice Cave. While the others rigged the entrance to Iceplug,
the McClurgs took me to 3 Level and introduced me to 32-degree caving.
The floor was one foot deep in ice, and there were several crystal-
clear ice formations, as well as sheets of ice with a pebbled surface. We
placed a register on the third level and then left.
That afternoon Dave and Molly McClurg and I went into Ice Plug. The
cave is only open on years when the precipitation has not been sufficient
to plug it. We were lucky to be able to just barely squeez in. The entrance
was about two by two feet, and a 'waterfall' of ice fills the bottom of
the entrance. Due to the steepness of the entrance, about 65 degrees, it
was necessary to rappel in. After rappelling in and snapping a few pic-
tures, we hurried to the back of the cave and found Pete and Paul finish-
ing a survey of the cave. They needed a third, so I volunteered while
the McClurgs started up the drop. Then, having finished our survey, we
mappers followed. The climb, though not more than 20 feet, is not for be-
ginners. Although I used a chest cam/floating Jurnar rig, it took me sev-
eral minutes to prussik out.
Our time was up, so we headed back to San Jose. On the long ride, I
contemplated the experiences of the weekend, and realized what a great
variety of caves there are beyond the karst with which I was familiar.
