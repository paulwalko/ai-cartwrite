GROTTO GRAPEVINE
It's been a long time since the Grapevine bore any fruit, but now it's
grape stoming time at VPI.
First, congratulations need be extended to the club's newest members:
Binny Ballou (#233), Steve Lancaster (#234), and Eric Anderson (#235). Sev-
eral more are on the way.
Romance is still alive in the VPI Grotto. Both Mike Richardson and
Mark Neas have gotten married (not to each other!). Bill Stephens and Pam
Buzas are now engaged as are Dave Bell and Jeanne Nye.
Bill Koerschner again claims to have finished Spring Hollow. He has
also finished Brickyard Ridge Cave and has published a map. Pighole is being
remapped by Chuck Shorten. Ed Devine and Joe Zokaites are still mapping
Paul Penley's Cave. Ed summed it up best on the sign out sheet when he wrote,
"Welcome back my friends, to the cave that never ends." Along with caving,
people have been spending time 4-wheeling and a group rappeled a large drop
in a neighboring state.
Fall vertical session was a big success and prospective members nearly
outnumbered members. Thanks go to Chuck and everyone who helped make it an
ecellent learning experience.
There have been many rescue alerts in the past few monthe and these have
kept the club on its toes. While on the subject of cave rescues, congratula-
tions to the Giles County Rescue Squad for the trophy they received for their
participation in the New River Cave rescue this past January.
Richard Cobb did some traveling this past summer. In traveling between
Virginia and Florida, he found the best and the most economical accomoda-
tions to be the private accomadations offered by many of the rail companies.
The furnishings are sparce but the ride was free.
The Sauvignes had an infectious Fourth of July party that was well at-
tended for that time of year. Old Timers Reunion was fantastic, to say the
least, and congratulations are extended to all the prize winners.
Well, fall rolled around and we faced another Miller Competition. After
easily winning in the open division last spring, we were moved to the frater-
nity division. Although we faced stiff competition there, we won the compe-
tition. Fran Wistoff and Paul Kirchman were instrumental in our success.
Speaking of Paul, he has announced his retirement from caving, again.
If Koerschner holds true to form, Paul's so-called retirement won't last
very long.
If any good gossip or significant news has been left out of the Grape-
vine this time around, just write it down on the bathroom walls of the Hokie
House. Our competent staff will take care of it from there. And if you don't
know any, go out and make some news; discover a cave, flame out at a party,
or get married. So until next time, cave your brains out.
