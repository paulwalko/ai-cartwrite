With the passing of the initial shock, Paul had calmed
down considerably. His knuckles, however, were still white
on the steering wheel, and he kept looking at the truck in
front of us, and then at me, and then back again. There was
a gleam in his eye that concerned me somewhat for the unknown
nymph that was so obviously the cause of all this. Well, she
and her truck. Now, I've long had a high opinion of Paul, and
considered him a reasonably rational human being, but I'd
never seen him under this much pressure, and wasn't sure what
he was capable of.
We'd been driving the whole time, and both vehicles ap-
peared to be headed for the University Mall. This likelihood
had just presented itself to me when Paul, with oath-taking
solemnity, said,
"If she climbs out of that truck and jumps into a dump-
ster, I'll marry her!" Then, with a dreamy look into the dis-
tance and a tender voice, "We could drive off into the sun-
set in our F100's and haul stuff happily ever aftert"
But, it was not to be. Fate being what fate is, she turn-
ed off into the drillfield. "There's mud on the sides!" cried
Paul longingly. "My dream girl! You can't leave me! Wait!
I'll show you how to scavenge! (sob) For Miller bottles!"
Even this undoubtable expression of devotion was ignored
as the heartless girl continued on her way, without so much
as a backward glance. Silence prevailed as we drove despon-
dently on to Macado's, each keeping our thoughts to ourselves
and hurt trying to hide in Paul's saddened eyes.
Moments later she was seemingly forgotten as we tore in-
to the dumpsters, spirits high with anticipation. These were
soon dampened as our frenzied search revealed nothing, not
even the hand hugh had wanted as a souvenir. He had severed
it from the arm of some dummy stupid enough to stick it down
his pants, and then lost it in the heat of the moment. Paul
had hoped to find it and give it to Hugh as a Halloween sur-
prise.
As we drove back past the drillfield I mentioned some-
thing to Paul about following his dream girl, but he just re-
plied that she had left him, and he wouldn't give her another
