was so heavy below me that at first I had difficulty moving, but
I finally got my rack properly adjusted and was on my way. The
whole shaft was filled with a haze from the waterfall. Chuck's
Wheat Lamp cut a fine beam through the fog below me. I could tell
he was a long ways down, but not really how far. Then I looked
up and saw a carbide lamp high above me. Stephens told me later
that they'd been watching ne shilouetted in the fog by Chuck's
lamp, and it had looked really neat.
The deeper I went the farther away the walls were. At the
top the pit is only 20 or so feet across. At the bottom it is
a huge, impressive room, about 100 feet across with waterfalls
landing near the middle of it. Finally, Chuck and the bottom
came into view. I let out a yell as my feet touched the floor -
I was down! I was followed by Bill, Joey, and Pete, "T,A,G Hall",
as the room at the bottom is naned, is gigantic, with an opening
in one end to the rest of the cave. We left our vertical gear at
the bottom of the drop, since we wouldn't need it again till it
was time to climb out.
We had a couple of maps, but they were not very detailed. We
spent several hours trying to find our first objective, the "Gyp-
sum Room". We finally found it, and in the process saw some
beautiful crystalline formations all over the ceiling. In one
place long clear gypsum needles covered the floor; they looked
like glass needles, but were flexible, almost like plastic. We
stopped for a lunch break in the Gypsum Room (about 5 or 6 hours
into the cave) and then tried to find the way to "Angel's Paradise".
â€¢ The problem is that there are about 3 parallel passages at
slightly different levels, and they cross and interningle enough
that it is very easy to get confused. And confused we got! But
we saw a lot of neat things in the midst of our confusion. In
many places the walls, ceilings and rocks glittered with millions
of diamond like reflections - absolutely beautiful. One roon,
the "Snowball Dome", had a pure white 3 foot round formation that
looked just like a huge snowball. I've seen a couple of Gysum
flowers in Clover Hollow before, and thought they were really
neat. This cave had them growing like weeds!
We finally came to some booming trunk passage that we lit-
erally ran through - you could have driven a motorcycle through
it. We followed this for a ways, did a couple of climbs, crawls
and chimneys, and arrived at the "North Pole". The North Pole
is an incredible icicle-like formation, a foot or so long, grow-
ing out of the ceiling. It was crystal clear and made of epsomite,
a form of epsom salt. Everyone waited while I dug out my camera
gear and took some pictures.
A little ways past the North Pole we came to the "Gnome
Creamery". "Moon Milk", a whitish gypsum powder, was all over
