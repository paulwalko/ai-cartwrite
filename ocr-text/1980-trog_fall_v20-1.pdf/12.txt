Reflections of a Resurrected Caver
Well, here I am. In the next room, some of the same old
folks are playing strip poker. Some are unwinding after a
long mapping trip into Pighole. Others are unwinding from a
long day of frantically working on the Trog. Others have
been unwound for years.
The question remains: Why am I not also in the next
room, playing strip poker? The answer is that I suddenly
felt compelled to come in here and write some pseudo-philo-
sophical bullshit. You know, empty the semigelatinous con-
tents of my brain onto the paper, and see what comes out.
I left town, rather suddenly, a couple of years ago.
When I returned earlier this quarter, I was not sure what I
would find. What I found is that the grotto is still the
same; even though so much has changed! The same old faces
aren't all the same, and yet I feel like I never left.
Why are these cavers all so close? Why is the Cave Club
so much more closely knitted than other organizations? I
think that it is because, that while Frats are strictly 800-
ial, and activity clubs gather just for their activities,
the VPI Cave Club is both of these things. We are all inte-
rested in caving, but we are also the main social contact
of most members.
And so it goes on, year after year. New caves being dis-
covered, old ones being rediscovered by new people, some
folks mapping, some being vertical nuts, the hard-core par-
t√Ωers, parties on the mountain, singing, four-wheeling, and
all the rest. Doug and Wolf and others that seem always to
be there to give advice to other, less-experienced cavers,
are still there. Perhaps this all seems dull to you, but to
me it seems remarkable that, with people graduating and mov-
ing away all the time, the traditions and atmosphere remains
so much the same. My hat's off to you, VPI. Grotto. .
