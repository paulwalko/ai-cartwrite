WHAT IS THE CAVE CLUB ABOUT?
BY BILL STEIER
While sitting at a party recently the someone asked
the question, what is the Cave Club all about anyway?
Parachuting was the snappy response offered by one
of our club members. At the time this seemed to be a
joke of an answer offered to the party crasher who ob-
viously was only looking for a keg and some free beer
for the evening. But the more I think about the this
question, though, the more I wonder if parachuting
could be a reasonable response. We need to look no
further than the German club to find an organization
whose name offers no clue to the purpose or activities
of the club. Delta-Delta-Delta, Phi-Sigma-Chi, what do
these names represent? The Greek letters which rep-
resent so many fraternities and sororities also give no
hint of the organization's goals and activities.
Back to the question at hand: What is the cave club all
about? What is in a name? I think most people, even
those of us who are non-cavers would say the cave
club is about caving. But what does caving mean? This
answer is too simple; we must look deeper. Our
group must be defined by what we do, and how we
do it. This article is meant to be a challenge, a spark,
an inspiration for our active club members to help de-
fine what the cave club is about.
Octoberfest this year was an exciting time for many
club members who got their first chance to browse
rough the VPI Club Files. I was certainly impressed
to find five four-drawer metal filing cabinets, nearly
completely full of past Trogs, publications by other
grottos, cave maps and various other tidbits of club
history. The files are a wonderful example of what the
cave club is about; they have preserved the many ac-
complishments of our club over its 54 year history.
Unfortunately most of the information seems to be
from long ago, when the “old farts” actually went cay-
ing. It's exciting to read about what these people did
and think about what we know about them today. But
I also wonder what people will think in 20 years from
now, what will they read about the cave club of the
1990's? How many of us have preserved our names in
the club's history, by putting our names on a new
cave map, or writing a memorable Trog article? We all
should want to leave our mark in the club history. We
are the old farts of the future, scary thought I know.
So the challenge is to go out and define what the cave
club is all about. Exploration, discovery, science,
mapping, preservation, caving safety, rescue tech-
niques, parachuting, making life-long friends, and
beer drinking, of course. Everyone needs to take
some type of initiative. The files are filled with maps
and trip reports from caves all over southern Virginia,
not just Giles and Montgomery County. So just do it!
Go caving in a new place, start a new tradition; the
club belongs to all of us and we are the ones who
need to define what it is about. And after we do these
things we should write a wonderful Trog article so Ei-
leen won't need to bug people!
Parachuting, you know I have never been parachut-
ing, would anyone like to join me for a jump?
