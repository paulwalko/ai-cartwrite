7. RETURN THAT GEAR!
We under-
stand that
your first
caye will
probably
leave you in
a dazed eu-
phoria, but
please re-
member to
return all the
club gear
you bor-
rowed back
to the trip
leader. It
may look banged and beat up, but it works (usually)
and is difficult to replace. Gear that goes missing
means more trainees like yourself won't be able to go
caving - plus it makes the officers grumpy.
8. PARTY DYNAMICS
Déja-vu! Hey,
weren't you
just at a party
last night? Be-
sides caving,
members of
the VPI Cave
Club like to
have a good
time when
they're outside
of caves, too.
1 BAT KEG" There are many
social events
that take place
throughout the
semester at the Bat Ranch or other cavers' homes.
They're great places to unwind, meet fun people, and
have good food and frosty beverages!
9. WE ARE THE PEOPLE YOUR PARENTS WARNED YOU
ABOUT
Your parents love you. This is why you're waking up
bleary eyed at 9 a.m. on a Sunday morning to answer
your ringing phone. Remember, be non-specific!
Mothers tend to get nervous when they hear their ba-
bies are doing strange things like caving with fun peo-
ple, and could possibly blow a gasket. If you feel you
must be honest and confess which club you partici-
pated with this weekend, remember two words: “Ven-
ture Out”.
10. YOU AND YOUR QCA
Welcome to the first day of the rest of your week!
Thanks to all the fun you had this weekend, you now
have a LOT of late night suffering ahead of you to get
all of Monday s work done on time. While we want to
see you participating in the Cave Club as much as pos-
sible, it's important that your school work doesn't suf-
fer from all the good caving you're getting in; too
much of any activity can cause disastrous results if you
neglect school in the process. Remember, the caves
have been there for a mind-boggling amount of time,
and we're fairly sure they'll be there next weekend
waiting for you.
There you have it; a pretty good start at how to plan
out your first weekends caving around the Blacksburg
area. Want to get even more information on the VPI
Cave Club or any other caving items? Check out the
official web page at www.vt.edu:10021/org/cave. It
has all the things you could possibly want to know
about cavers and caving.
