MAISTJARNAN, HRÚTAGJÁRDYNGJA ICELAND. MY EXPERIENCE IN A LAVA CAVE.

This past summer I had
the opportunity to see
one of the most fascinat-
ing places on earth, at
least for a geologist. I
had been planning to go
to Iceland for some
time, but I had no idea
when. The opportunity
Amy
arose to study geology
and geography and trav-
el the majority of the island. I had to take it. The vol-
canoes, glaciers, and waterfalls were all spectacular,
but as a caver I have to say that one evening that will
remain incredibly vivid in my memory is the day I vis-
ited a lava tube.
My knowledge of lava tubes was limited before I visit-
ed Maístjarnan (may-styar-non: the May Star). Sure, I
knew that as lava flowed, it could possibly form un-
derground channels, but I really had no idea what to
expect. Would this be like the large tubes in Hawaii
that one sometimes sees on the Discovery Channel?
How different are these caves from limestone, besides
mineralogy? This is what I found.
The first thing that I learned is that it is incredibly
tough to find a caver in Iceland. I got a few links from
people in the caving community, but none that could
really help. Finally, I was surfing the net and found a
page that had escaped me in all my searching: The
Icelandic Speleological Society. After looking through
the page and finding some information about these
caves (like the temperature, a “balmy 32 °F”), I imme-
diately sent an email to the address and within 24
hours, I had a reply. Sigurdur (Siggi) Jönsson, the ISS
president, had agreed that he would personally take
me caving during my stay. It took a couple of weeks
in Iceland before the cave trip was possible, but when
the evening came, I was ready.
Maístjarnan is a small lava cave located in the basaltic
Hrútagjárdyngja (hroot-a-gyowr-ding-ya: the Ram Fis-
sure) lava flow. Lava caves form as lava flows through
specific channels, much like a river. As it flows, the
channels can close or connect as the lava cools along
the edges and top to form a tube. The lava is then di-
rected over the tube, enclosing it. These tubes are
opened later by seismic activity (earthquakes!) or
sinking due to the weight of the rock. Although this
caye was small, it was well chosen by Siggi. It told me
some stories of its formation.
The passages criss-crossed like a braided stream, illus-
trating its formation by the flow of liquid rock. At one
point two channels or pathways crossed at right an-
gles to each other. Siggi informed me that this was the
only known occurrence of this in Iceland. The floor of
the cave mainly consisted of smooth pahoehoe lava,
which was very easy to walk on and easy on the boots.
Some areas were almost perfect tubes surrounded by
very smooth walls. Some of these walls were covered
with silver water droplets, which are replenished very
quickly, unlike those that take thousands of years to
replace in limestone caves. Contrary to the belief that
lava caving is just underground hiking, we did a lot of
crawling. The crawlways always seemed to be filled
with the sharp aa lava which made the fact that I had
no knee pads painfully clear. Siggi explained that
most tight passages were like this, making the small-
est people unable to get through them. Usually they
go untouched.
One thing that was surprising was the formations
found in the cave. There were stalactites and stalag-
mites within the passages. Although different chemi-
cally, they resembled those found in limestone caves.
The stalactites were the width of soda straws and
curled at the ends, reminding me of helictites in lime-
stone caves. The stalagmites were also thin and re-
sembled an upside-down calcite stalactite. Although
these formations have moisture on them and many of
the stalactites have that familiar droplet of water at
their ends, the cave is not still growing. The forma-
tions were created as the lava was degassing, forming
local cooling, and will not change unless they are bro-
ken. The minerals found in these formations are pla-
gioclase, silica, clinopyroxene, sphene, hematite, and
magnetite. Secondary alteration (new minerals
formed by hot vapors in the system) did occur, but
again the processes that formed them are not still oc-
curring. The secondary minerals present are hematite
and gypsum. The deposited gypsum resembles calcite
flowstones here. The hematite even looked much like
a flowstone, but formed from oxidation of lava that
broke through the tube from the surface and collect-
ed around existing rock within the tube.
During our trip, Siggi pointed out a wide crack. This
crack was not caused by contraction during cooling;
he said it was too large. Tectonic activity (rifting, or
the pulling apart of the island which is setting on the
Mid-Atlantic Ridge) created it. We were walking
through an area full of faults! This was a great remind-
er of how not only this cave came to be, but all of Ice-
land.
Since this trip, I have grown even more interested in
lava caves. I'm not saying that limestone caves aren't
wonderful. It's nice to squeeze through a pinch and
not have to worry too much about ripping your coy-
eralls. It was a unique experience that I hope to have
again. Anyone want to go?
Just a quick note. If you want some more info on lava
caves, there's been some recent articles in the NSS
News and a great scientific paper on the formation of
one lava tube cave in Hawaii. Surprise the keeper of
the files and ask for them.)
