AND NOW A WORD FROM OUR SPONSORS
BY BOB AND JACKIE HOELL
(Scene opens on poor, underfed, muddy, and worst
of all, sober cavers.)
(Scene switches to letter.)
Sally: Have you ever seen cavers like this and wished
you could do something? Well now you can. In just
a few minutes I will provide you with a toll free num-
ber you can call to help needy cavers right here in
America. But first, let's look at their plight through
their own eyes.
Dear Sponsor:
Thank you for the money. I bought
beer. Beer is good.
(Scene switches to small meeting room, filled with
young, unfed, sober cavers.)
I'm saving to buy a Simmons Roller
and 250' of PMI.
I love you.
Steve
Mike: It's been nearly two weeks since I've had my last
beer. (Crowd gasps.)
Mike Continues: And I have been forced to hitchhike
out to Pig Hole and Buddy's. I borrowed a rack from
Dave but now he wants it back. I don't know what I'm
going to do!
Steve: Well, at least you can hitchhike still. Ever since
I started caving with VPI I haven't had the money for
a shave OR a haircut. And laundering clothes is out.
No one within miles will pick me up. At least my dues
allow me to get carbide. Otherwise I'd be trying to
cave in the dark!
(Change scene back to Sally.)
(Scene switches back to Sally outside cave entrance.)
Sally: Other sponsorships are also possible. For
twenty dollars a month you can receive a "special"
picture of you boy or girl caver. Or, you might choose
to simply adopt your needy caver and have them live
with you. You decide, but make the choice that will
allow these helpless souls face mud and darkness
with the thought that you care about them!
Sally: You've seen these pitiful souls (muddy cavers
emerge from cave in the background). In fact, you
might have been one years ago. Wouldn't you like to
sponsor a needy caver? Just a dollar a week or a dollar
per cave visited could be used to help a needy caver.
Ten dollars a month will get you a picture of your
needy caver, and you can choose a boy or a girl. For
15 dollars a month your own personal needy caver
will write you a letter, explaining how your money
has helped them.
