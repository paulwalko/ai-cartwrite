I came back to this cave for the beauty it offers, but
awaiting me at the bottom of the entrance drop was
dead cow. At least it appeared dead, i.e. no pulse, ex-
treme decomposition, eyes fixed and dialated, rigor
mortis, etc. You could at least let the unfortunate one
be the missing Jimmy Hoffa or someone I could tell
my grandkids about. Well, it's about dinner time and
I know where I can get my hands on some free “prime
rib”. Take Care!
Mike King
Well, I'm back down here. Been here twice this year
and didn't get to rap down. Well, Carl and I did it a
new way for us - from the Empiors Ledge. Feels great
to be down here! And boy to Carl and I have a great
feast in store PRIME RIB. Oh maybe a week or so out
date, But cavers are a tough breed and raw meat is
tasty. But really folks, Cecil is going to haul it out.
Well, we are heading to smoke hole next.

Well, the cow is marbled very fine - excellent prime
rib in store. We won't let the bones get in the way.
Vertical always great. But we forgot the T-P so Ed
(Boynton) may shit in his coveralls on the way up.
Could stink up my damn rope! Ed's first vertical trip
- he's done super (of course he had great teachers).
Out to smoke hole - very dry today.

Is not “King” full of shit! = E.B.
Ed just shit - man this place stinks!!
People with bowel problems should not be allowed
in a place such as this. Ed Boynton just created an en-
vironment that caused the bats to wake. I would
write more, but the smell forces me to move on. P.S.
That is the worst embalming job I have ever seen i.e.
The dead cow. Later, Carl H Shytle NSS 25408

A rainy day outside. Nice and dry inside. 1st time
down - and most largest time! You've got monster
balls to do this stuff. Thanks to the master cavesman-
ship of Mike King and Carl Shytle I've come this far. If
I ever get to write another term paper I can talk about
this. Until next time... Ed Boynton

Darkness is an enemy not a fear so we came we saw
