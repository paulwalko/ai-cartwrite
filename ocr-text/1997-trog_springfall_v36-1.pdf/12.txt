ing additional grottos in on bigger, organized training
sessions, such as an NCRC type session. Since NCRC
was mentioned some ideas were tossed around about
making sure that NCRC and the likes realize that there
is a valuable pool of well trained cavers available for
rescues. The recent and on-going difficulties between
VPI and some key rescue individuals has focused the
committee on doing some positive restoration work
on the VPI image. Working with new local cavers and
other grottos had been mentioned as an excellent
way to help with our image.
Now before you start jumping up and down and say
ing, “The club can't afford that” or “I don't think that
is a good idea,” etc... wait a second. This is a commit-
tee that is meeting to wade through things to make
any meeting more bearable when any item might
come up for a necessary vote. Everyone in this group
is really concerned about the club and its member-
ship, enough so to take time out of their schedules to
meet and discuss pertinent issues. The Safety Com-
mittee is a fairly diverse group discussing these ideas,
and believe me there are a number of viewpoints that
are being covered. Although the discussions can be-
come pretty heated, we are working towards a com-
mon goal of bettering the club. However, new ideas
and view points are always welcome and we all en-
courage active participation in the committee.
As a final note I want to point out to both members
and prospective members (trainees) that if you feel
something is wrong, be it on a trip or at a training ses-
sion or just in general, bring it up to the Vice Presi-
dent or any member of the Safety Committee. We are
here to help keep up the club's excellent safety and
training record, and almost as important, to make
sure we all have fun while underground.
