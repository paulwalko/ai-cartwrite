On November 9, 1997, Cecil Porterfield, owner of Pig
Hole Cave, was presented with the VAR Landowner
Recognition Award. VPI members gathered with
those from New River and Blue Ridge Grotto as Don
Anderson gave Mr. Porterfield an engraved plaque
and a heartfelt “thank you”. The award is given each
year to a landowner in appreciation of their good re-
lations with cavers and a willingness to allow us onto
their property and into their caves.
Cavers are especially grateful to Mr. Porterfield for re-
opening Pig Hole several years after a fatality oc-
curred there. Pig Hole has long been a favorite of
many VPI cavers.
Mr. Porterfield was also given the original cave regis-
ter from Hess' Hollow and a typed, bound copy
thanks to the work of Steve Wells and Steve LePera.
(They also left a new register in its place, so be sure to
sign it on your next trip.)
After the presentation the grotto members mingled
over snacks and frothy beverages. Mr. Porterfield
shook the hand of each caver as snowflakes swirled
onto the field.
