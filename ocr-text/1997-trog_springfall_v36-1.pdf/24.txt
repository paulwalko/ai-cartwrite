drop and lead back up. Great cave! Found part of a
flip-flop - wonder if it belonged to the guy who lost
his glove -
The free is always great. I thought there was a beer
stand down here, but someone lied.
It's been fun, but if we are to make it back to Greens-
boro by 7:00 PM we had better get our asses on the
move! We will be back in a year or so to check on
things. -Carl H. Shytle
