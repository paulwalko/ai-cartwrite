This past January Steve Wells and I decided to put to-
gether Frog systems for use on our trip to Mexico. We
sought out the few cavers around town who had ex-
perience with the Frog and picked their brains for
what we needed to know. Then we proceeded to as-
semble and experiment with our new systems. It was
a process of trial and error that involved a lot of error.
In March we took our systems south of the border to
Sistema Cheve. Over the course of six weeks we com-
pared notes with seasoned expedition cayers and put
our own evolving Frogs through some hard-core in-
cave use. During this time I discovered that the
Mighty Frog is a truly superior vertical system. Now I
have made it my mission to preach the good news of
the Mighty Frog. It is perfect for those who are look-
ing for something more substantial than “knots” but
do not wish to trash a ropewalker in our local mud
holes.
BACKGROUND
The Frog system was developed in Europe. It evolved
around the European rigging style for dealing with
vertical sections of caves. They generally use thinner
ropes (9 mm) on the other side of the Atlantic. This
means that their margin of safety when dealing with
rub points is much smaller. They tackle this problem
by installing “rebelays” at rub points on vertical
drops. A rebelay is simply a point where a knot is tied
in the rope hanging down a pit and the knot is
clipped to a bolt or natural rig point on the wall. A
wonderful idea, but you have to remove your ascend-
ing/descending system from one side and move it to
the other each time you come to a rebelay. Obviously
this is a hassle, and in the quest to make the process
easier the Frog was born. Nowadays you will not meet
a European caver who has not heard of the Frog, and
many of them use it exclusively. The Frog is still not
widely used in the U.S., but that is changing.
THE BASIC IDEA
Climbing with a Frog is a lot like climbing rope on
knots. Both are sit-stand ascending rigs. The main dif-
ference is that unlike knots you never have to remove
your hands from the top ascender with the Frog.
The system is set up as such: One top ascender is at-
tached to a cord with foot loops and also a safety teth-
er to the seat harness. A second ascender is attached
directly to the front of your seat harness, it is held up-
right by a harness on the chest. Petzl’s Croll ascender
is designed specifically for this purpose.
The climbing action is simple. With both ascenders
clipped to the rope simply push the top one up the
rope while raising your feet at the same time. Then
tuck your feet under your butt and stand up in the
foot loops, mainly using your arms to stabilize this
motion. The Croll will be pulled upward by the chest
harness. As you ease back into a sitting position it will
hold as you once again slide the top ascender up-
ward.
For crossing rebelays a pair of cow tails will take the
place of the tether mentioned above. Cow tails are
simply two cords of different lengths attached to the
harness at one end and with a carabiner at their other
ends. This is one case where non-locking carabiners
are better suited for the job than locking carabiners.
DISADVANTAGES
There are no absolutes in the vertical world except
"wear a helmet.” The Frog is not the best system for
every situation. The Frog will not fit in your pocket
like a set of prussik knots, and it will not maximize
your endurance the way a well tuned ropewalker will.
If you need to travel ridiculously light or need to as-
cend more than 200' of rope at a climb, this might not
be the right system for a particular trip, The Frog must
be tuned to your own body proportions to be effi-
cient. A seat harness with a low point of attachment is
also needed to make the Frog efficient. The Frog can
hamper you if not removed before going through a
squeeze.
The most important thing to understand about the
Frog is the bounce involved in the climbing motion.
This will test your anchor more than any other system
and aggravate any problems you have with rub points.
The only other disadvantage revolves around the type
of seat harness that works best with the Frog. This can
be difficult to remove if the screw-link has been tight-
ened as much as it should be. The problem arises
when your body needs relief that can only be
achieved with the harness off.
ADVANTAGES
For the sake of simplicity I put these in list form.
The Frog:
• is not as bulky and cumbersome off rope as a rope-
walker.
• is attached to the rope by two mechanical ascend-
ers making it extremely fast for getting on and off
rope. You might want to carry a third ascender with
you in case of a problem with one of your two main
ascenders.
costs less to assemble than a ropewalker. The only
part that really should be stitched is the seat har-
ness. The hardware from a Frog can also be incor-
porated into a ropewalker.
