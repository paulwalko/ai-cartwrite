MISSION IMPOSSIBLE
BY CHRIS HIBSHMAN
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to
clean Tawney's Cave of any graffiti or litter and re-
store it to its natural condition. As always, if you
should fail, we will take not responsibility for your ac-
tions. Impossible? Some people think so, especially
since this cave is well traveled.
So, one Sunday morning in early November eleven of
us gathered at the Bat Ranch in anticipation of taking
a cave trip into Tawney's. This particular trip was un-
like most trips; it was a conservation trip being led by
conservation committee chairman Joey Fagan.
Now, you are probably thinking, “It doesn't sound
like a lot of fun cleaning up someone else's mess.” We
all knew in the back of our minds that sooner or later,
someone would probably come back and use a can of
spray paint to write more obscenities all over the cave
walls. Why then, should we spend our time to clean a
cave? First, we want new cavers not to believe it is typ-
ical for cave walls to display vulgar language. Second,
we hope to set an example and discourage people
from vandalizing in the future.
In order to clean the cave we needed some equip-
ment. With help from Charlie Maus and the Cave Con-
servancy of the Virginias, Joey supplied the group
with gloves, spray bottles, brushes, sponges, eye gog-
gles, vinegar, water, and hydrochloric acid mix. Ray
Sira came prepared with a pressurized tank of water,
Amy Johnson with a toothbrush, and the rest of us
(Sandy Knapp, Chris Rourke, Steve LePera, Steve
Wells, Mike Horne, Eileen O'Malley, and Aaron Gor-
don) with lots of elbow grease.
We all gathered the gear and headed up the steep
path to the entrance before Fat Man's Misery. Chris
Rourke, Steve and Steve headed deeper into the cave
armed with trash bags in search of litter. The rest of
us stayed near the entrance to learn the best tech-
niques for restoring a cave. The big room just inside
the entrance was the first target of the day. On the left
was a beautiful formation of white mold covering a
small pile of rotting logs. To the right was a wall cov-
ered with silver spray paint, chalk, deep scratches,
and black carbon marks left by carbide lamps. The
other walls were not as decorated as the right wall,
but we still had our work cut out for us. The idea with
cave restoration is to improve on the appearance of
the cave and to preserve the historic artifacts. Not all
the writing should be removed. Some of the inscrip-
tions date back to the Civil War era; these you want to
keep. If you are not careful, you might cause more
harm than good.
Believe it or not, this wall showed almost no writing
when the "cave maids” left.
We first tried using a wire brush to scrap away the
black carbon lettering. This proved to be a poor tool
because it left many coarse scratches in the delicate
mud-caked wall. We next tried using nylon scrub
brushes and water. This technique left a much more
appealing sight. The brush cleaned away the carbon
and even blended in the surrounding cave mud, leav-
ing no scratches. Wet sponges also proved to be great
utensils in blending cave mud and filling cracks, but
it was not the best to remove stains. Ray's pressurized
water tank was very helpful in supplying the water
that was used to wash away the carbon and fill the
cracks with mud.
