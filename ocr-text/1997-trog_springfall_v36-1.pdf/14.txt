Several trainees and a few members took to the dark
side this year at Dixie Caverns' Haunted Caverns the
week before Halloween. The crew consisted of a dead
bride (killed by her hubby on their wedding night), a
gruesome butcher (carving a screaming man), an evil
executioner, a poor innocent spun into a cocoon, and
assorted dead corpses wandering through the cave.
The Halloween party took place at the Bat Ranch.
Molly Lucier dressed as Dorothy, Ray Sira as the Scare-
crow, and Nathan Sharp as the Tinman, so naturally
there was a pair of red and white striped witch legs
protruding from under the house.
The Steves were in full force that night. Steve Wells
and LePera came as giant mushrooms, and Amy
Johnson and Kelly Rose came as Steve Wells and LeP-
era. The more alcohol you consumed, the harder it
was to know which Steve you were actually talking to.
Grotto rescues cavers.” When asked about the rumors
co-chairman Craig Ferguson made this statement:
“These are very serious allegations. While we have no
evidence at this time, the matter is being thoroughly
investigated. Any members found guilty will face the
Elvis Grotto Spanking CommitteeTM, presided over by
the honorable Kristin Possom.”
CLUB POSITIONS (HMM....)
An unexpected election took place recently as Amy
Johnson asked to step down from her position as club
Secretary to focus on her graduate work. A tough
campaign took place and finally Matt Burnett won out
over his opponent, Matt Burnett.
Former Safety Committee Chairman Ed Fortney
moved to northern Virginia to accept a job. (For some
of us cave trips aren't as fun without Ed's humor,
charm, and peanut M&M's.) The vacancy was recently
filled by Mike3 Horne, who jumped quickly into his
role and has begun regular Safety Committee meet-
ings (see article by Dave Colatosti, p. 10).
Jackie and Bob Hoell have pulled up stakes and
moved to the D.C. area for Bob's new job. Jackie,
long-time club Faculty Advisor, has been replaced by
Walt Pirie.
The club has gained three new voting trainees: Jessica
Dorr, Matt Burnett, and Chris Hibshman. (Now doing
shots with the Vice President is optional.)
DANGER! MATURITY ALERT
Dave Cinsavich is finally going domestic. He recently
purchased a house on Grove Avenue in Blacksburg,
and he and Kim Hansen moved in early November.
Dave has been spotted in local stores purchasing fan-
cy rugs and draperies. Suspiciously, the couple won't
be hosting the yearly Trim a Tree party this Decem-
ber. Some wonder if Dave and Kim are becoming “too
good” to have cavers puking in their home, setting
coats on fire, and running over their cats.
HALLOWEEN FESTIVITIES.
Shroom and Anti-shroom.
The Heaven's Gate group passed out pudding and
"quaaludes”, and laid down covering their faces with
purple cloth at the appropriate time.
Over the Halloween weekend several old farts went
hiking in celebration of Russ Peterson's 50th birthday.
Now that's scary!
CAVER INJURIES
Steve Wells is definitely vying for the "Most Injured
Caver" award. He broke his ankle on a cave trip and
wore a cast for about eight weeks. Shortly after that
healed he went on a Mexico survey trip with Carl
Bern. When Carl had the nerve to let a huge rock land
on and injure his leg, Steve retaliated by tearing some
ligaments in his “good” ankle. Now that he's left with
no good ankles, we wonder when he'll start breaking
wrists.
That's the news. Hope to see everyone at Banquet!
