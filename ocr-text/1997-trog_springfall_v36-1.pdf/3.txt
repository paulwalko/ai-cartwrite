SECRETS OF AMGINE CAVE
BY JESSICA DORR
This short story was originally written for my fresh-
man English class. The topic of my class was science
fiction. This story is completely fictional, but there are
a few truths.
A sharp ring fills the room. The sound of the alarm is
deafening, but somehow I manage to still be half
asleep as I roll out of bed. I prepared all my gear last
night. I even left my clothes out. There was no telling
if I'd be able to function this morning, so everything
is in it's place. I pull on my jeans, still encrusted with
mud, and my shirt stained brown from its many trips
underground. Why had I decided to get up this early?
It is Saturday for God's sake. Perhaps the love of going
into the dark or maybe going somewhere new is ex-
citing. How can I explain?
I wasn't planning on going underground this week-
end, but it is a dare and I am never one to refuse a
challenge. Since I first began caving the old farts
warned against trips into Amgine Cave. People have
gone in, but they never talk about what they see. It's
like they're forced into silence by something un-
known. Why? Some conjectured that there must be
some horrible scene, like dead bodies. Others claim it
is a pathway to a lost city. Maybe we'll find Atlantis.
Face first into the darkness, I strain to fit through the
narrow passage. They shout back, “The entrance is a
pinch, but it opens up.” My fearless leaders are wait-
ing in the small entrance room. I turn to see the day-
light, one last time, before continuing into the depths
of the earth. As we delve deeper the formations begin
to appear. Stalactites, stalagmites, soda straws, col-
umns,...all around us, the beautiful formations. Why
wasn t this caye mapped? Why weren't pictures taken
of its beauty? Those that had entered before must
have been crazy for not sharing such a sight..
Last night Tiff and I decided to take Charley up on his
dare to enter Amgine Cave. Charley's dad had gone in
a decade ago. Whenever Charley brought up the cave
his father somehow managed to change the subject.
Those that had gone in never said anything on the
subject of Amgine, not even to tell others not to go. It
was the old timers that had seen what had happened
to those that went in, that warned people to stay
away.
Charley was determined to get in and show us all that
he could conquer this cave. He had plans to tell every-
one what he saw. Although Charley was hot headed
enough to enter, he knew he must take another caver
with him. Tiff, Charley, and I have been close friends
since grade school, so naturally he tricked us into go-
ing with him. He began by telling us we never pushed
the limits any more, and then brought up his idea.
How could we refuse such a blatant attempt at mak-
ing us feel guilty?
Now we are covered with mud and heading to some
unknown destination No one has ever mapped
Amgine so this is going to be quite an adventure. The
entranceway leads down to a large room. Our breath
is taken away by the pure brilliancy of the room. After
some time of staring, wide eyed, we take a crawl
down a tight passage. The crawl ends abruptly. An-
noyed that the passage doesn't go anywhere, we back
out to the large room. The second passage we take is
even smaller. Pictures and voices begin in my head in
the second crawl. I know we are headed in the right
direction. As I slide my body into the small passage, a
picture of a stream enters my mind. I think at first that
I am just thinking about a stream I have seen in anoth-
er cave. As I slide through to where I can stand, I hear
the sound of running water and see my vision before
me. Déja vu envelops my thoughts. A chill runs down
my spin.
Some one is calling me. The voice sounds much like
my mother's sweet call. Not the bellow that I am used
to now, but the call she had used when my brother
and I were young. “Sam, J.C., time for dinner.” I fol-
low the sound down the stream bed to a room more
immense than any room I have ever encountered. All
around me stands the beauty, the gracefulness of the
forms. Each formation is alone, but together they
form fluidity unmatched by any cave I have seen.
All of a sudden a rush of panic comes over me. What
if I break something? The voices explain nothing, but
make me feel at home among them. I know as I walk
along that they will protect the cave. I sense that if
others enter there will be trouble. This force cannot
control everyone. Perhaps that is why no one spoke of
the beauty. This cave is only for those who dare to go
into the unknown.
Another wave of panic comes to my mind. Where are
Tiff and Charley? I scan around me, but they are no-
where to be seen. My mind slowly wonders back to
the cave. The force guides me through the far reaches
of the network. Each room and passage becomes
more breathtaking than the other. Soon there is no
more and I find myself back in the small room that
leads to the entrance. Now the entrance will be my ex-
it. I see Charley and Tiff. We say nothing, just exit the
cave together, the way we had entered. Perhaps in the
future we will talk freely of the adventure in Amgine
Cave, We are half in shock now, thinking of what had
happened.
What had caused this? I wasn't sure, but like the oth-
ers before me, I knew I could not discuss what I had
found. This cave has to be preserved. Amgine is too
stunning for just anyone to enter. Only those that
push the limits and understand the beauty can see the
truth. The truth of Amgine cave is not only the beauty
that I witnessed. Much like the network of a cave, the
truth runs deep. The truth of Amgine is important to
the conservation of all caves. Those that went in be-
fore me kept Amgine cave a mystery and so would I.
