TRIP REPORT: CALDWELL CAVE
BY MATTHEW M. BURNETT
It was pretty nice for 9:30 when I met Carl and Mike
at Signout. We gathered our gear, loaded it in my car,
and set out to Wild and Wonderful West Virginia.
Caldwell is just past Honaker Cave on that really nar-
row, winding road that leads out to nowhere. Of
course since it's a little bit further down the road, we
had to drive a little past nowhere.
It was about noon when we pulled off the road to
change. It was not any warmer than it was earlier that
morning; in fact, I thought it was quite colder. But at
least it wasn't snowing. I vow I will go on a caving trip
on a beautiful day just so I won't freeze my butt off
changing
The entrance to Caldwell is pretty impressive. You en-
ter by going down a mild breakdown slope into the
side of the hill. It's a fairly big entrance. Once inside,
we climbed up รก 12'-15' drop into a narrow passage-
way and began to rig the first drop.
The path we took to get through Caldwell had four
drops. Since there are not many rig points at the top
of the first drop, Carl and Mike rigged it about 10'
away from the drop. It was a pretty interesting rig in
that the passageway had to be padded more than the
actual drop. It took about an hour to get that rig set
up and I spent the time watching the sunlight come
through the entrance. Finally the first drop was rigged
and Mike went down first. I followed behind him and
learned that he had already rigged the second drop in
the time it took me to rappel down.
The third drop was more of a nuisance drop that
could be free climbed or avoided by taking tubes to
the left of the drop. Carl chose to climb down the
drop while Mike took me through the tubes (being
the true adventurer that I am I chose to postpone the
climb as long as I could).
It was just after this section that we entered into what
I considered the most interesting room of the cave.
This room was very active and it was covered in flow-
stone and cave popcorn as a result. There was a very
narrow foot path to use to cross the room without
causing any more damage to the room than was nec-
essary.
Eventually we made our way to the fourth and final
drop. There were two methods of rigging this drop.
The whole drop could be rigged at the very top (and
again the rig point was a good distance from the drop
itself), or, since it was a three tiered drop, we could
climb down the first two tiers and rig the last part.
Mike mentioned that Steve and Steve had climbed
down to the last tier and rigged that drop. This didn't
make me feel any better since Steve and Steve are con-
siderably better climbers than I am.
After about 15 minutes of deciding how they had
climbed down and how we were going set the belay-
er, we decided to try this approach. Mike and Carl
dug out two footholds for the belayer to set his feet
since there was no good place for him to sit. This was
a quality belay method. It was a 40' drop in all with the
first tier being 15', the second being 10' and the third
being about 15'. Carl thought that if he fell he would
just bang all the way down to the bottom while I took
a different perspective: I was just going to fall straight
down the 40'. It was impossible to fall straight down I
later learned, but I was confident that I could find a
way. The climb was much easier than it looked. The
hardest part was stepping off onto a ledge on the op-
posing wall and straddling the drop. After that it was
just an easy chimney down. I went back later with
Steve LePera and found out that he didn't like that
climb at all since the rock you had to step out on
didn't look too stable.
The second part of the drop was a very easy climb
down through a little running water and the last part
was a simple arm rappel. Before I went over the last
drop, Carl told me to watch out because I would be
rappelling over a lip and if I banged my hand on a
rock, it would automatically let go of the rope and I
would fall. I don't know what I was doing but appar-
ently I wasn't listening. I went over the side, banged
my hand, let go of the rope and gave myself a heart at-
tack as the ground began to rush toward me much
faster than I would've liked. Luckily I wrapped the
webbing around my arm twice so my hand caught be-
fore I completely lost control and landed on my face.
Climbing out the fourth drop was also pretty eventful.
I was climbing up the middle part when a drop of wa-
ter splashed just right (or just wrong) and extin-
guished my carbide flame. There I was, in the middle
of a climb without any light (I gotta get an electric hel-
met light) when I muttered a short prayer and for the
first time ever managed to light my carbide light with
one hand while it was still mounted on my helmet.
By this point in my trip my backpack was completely
destroyed. I had to keep it closed using a 10' piece of
webbing, a carabiner, and a rock. It was a pretty ugly
set-up, but with a lot of work, it barely stayed togeth-
er. The rest of the trip out was pretty uneventful. Mike
and I climbed up the third drop while Carl crawled
through the tubes and on the second drop I per-
formed what is becoming my signature move:
prussiking into a tight squeeze.
We left the cave at about five and it was still cold. It's
spring, it's not supposed to be cold. I figured that it
was just my imagination until I saw the snow flurries.
I have got to go caving when it's warm.
Epilogue: I went back to Caldwell and it wasn't as ex-
citing as I remembered, although that could have
been because I didn't fall off any rappel lines or
climbed out over any drops, although I did destroy
another cave pack. Damn that cave! It's going to make
me buy decent equipment despite all I can do.
