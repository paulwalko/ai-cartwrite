On some of the more troublesome stains, we sprayed
vinegar onto the stain and scrubbed with the nylon
brushes. The silver spray paint proved to be even
more difficult, so we resorted to the diluted hydro-
chloric acid. We cut the concentrated acid at the rate
of 10 parts water to 1 part acid. It is very important to
dilute the acid with water to prevent any more dam-
age than necessary to the cave walls. The concentrat-
ed acid would seriously etch away at the rock and do
more harm than good. We found the best technique
for applying the acid mix was to spray the affected
area and let it sit; and after 10-15 minutes came back
and washed it down with water. We all wore safety
glasses and rubber gloves to protect ourselves from
the acid as well as from the loose particles dislodged
by our scrubbing and rubbing.
We applied some final touches to the walls like add-
ing and blending in mud. Amy even went through the
trouble of delicately blending and restoring the mud
with a toothbrush. It is important to return a thin lay-
er of mud onto the bare walls. This makes it easier to
remove future paint and graffiti and clean the walls
during future conservation trips. We spent over an
hour and a half cleaning the room before moving on
to the next room.
Near the main entrance, the walls of the large decorat-
ed room were likewise decorated with the same silver
spray paint and carbide lamp soot. We spent another
hour and a half practicing our conservation tech-
niques. We also noticed that the Virginia Cave Law
sign was missing from the cave. Mike made a mental
note to replace it in the future.
In the meantime, we meet up with three separate
groups of cavers from Longwood College, Hollins
College, and Davidson College as well as a few flash-
light toting cavers from Blacksburg. We talked to each
group, discussing cave safety, conservation, and the
National Speleological Society. Of course we told
them about the YPI Cave Club and our fantastic web
page. We even invited them to attend one of our Fri-
day night meetings! As we applied the finishing touch-
es to this room, Chris, Steve and Steve came by on
their way out of the cave with a bag full of trash.
After three hours of scrubbing walls with vinegar and
acid, we lost much of our enthusiasm for scrubbing
cave walls. We packed up all the gear and header
back to the surface and the Bat Ranch. We talked
about a more extensive conservation project for the
future, maybe in New River Cave to remove arrows or
to Nellie's Cave to clean up trash. The one thing I did
learn from this unique trip is that cave restoration is a
challenging art. It takes some practice and a lot of pa-
tience, but it is also very rewarding. Lastly, the trip
would not be complete without firing up M3's car-
bide powered potato gun and making some serious
noise. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!
