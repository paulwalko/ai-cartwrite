A WEEKEND CAVING GUIDE FOR TRAINEES
BY MIKE McAvoy, COCKY TRAINEE
The Son D
Congratulations! You've just taken the first big step in
becoming a member of the Virginia Tech Cave Club:
you've paid your dues! With a flourish of money your
folks back home slaved hard to provide you with, you
have at your fingertips all the basic technical knowl-
edge you need to head out underground. However,
we here at the VPI Cave Club realize that there are nu-
merous little bits of information that the novice cayer
does not pick up on before heading into those first
few caves. Therefore, this user friendly ten step pro-
gram to your caving weekend has been painstakingly
designed so you can schedule your activities ahead of
time in the comfort and ease of your home.
1. FRIDAY AFTERNOON
It's the last day of the week,
and you're sitting bored in
your dorm wondering how
in the world you're going to
keep yourself amused all
weekend. You could go
hang out somewhere
downtown and essentially
do very little with other
people who are also doing
very little, or maybe start
studying for that Dynamics
test on Monday (yeah,
right). Well how about
spending your Friday
evening learning about the
best way to have a good time in Blacksburg on a week-
end? Yep, that's right - caving! Avoid the listless
hordes on campus, and come check out the vast laby-
rinths that have been under Blacksburg for millions of
years!
2. SMYTHE 146
You seem to have found Virginia Tech's darkest cor-
ner of campus. This spooky quad houses the grand
hall where the VPI Cave Club meets every Friday night
sometime after 7 p.m. (see Caver Time). When the
meeting does start, you'll get some idea of what the
proceedings will have in store for the evening. You
can count on some kind of caving program after club
business is concluded as well as trips that are being
planned for Saturday. If you have any questions,
speak up; most cavers would gladly spend the next
millennium discussing the ins and outs of caving with
you.
3. SPELEO SEMINAR
Hey, don't be shy! Every Friday night a caver volun-
teers their humble abode for a caving seminar *cough
party cough*. This is a good place for you to meet the
people you will be with tomorrow, find out more
about that thing called caving, and to do what cavers
do best: relax. It's the best way to unwind.
4. CAVER TIME
Well, it's 9 a.m. on a Saturday morning, and you're
shivering outside of Smythe with the other prompt
trainees, wondering where the heck your trip leader
is. Welcome to caver time! It's not that cavers are per-
petually tardy, we simply prefer to think that we're re-
ally good arriving somewhere in a fashionably relaxed
manner (1.e. late). Once you do get going, you'll hit
Signout, pick up some club caving gear, and make a
food stop at Wades before scooting off to the cave.
Keep in mind that the food and water you bring
should not only be enough for the length of the trip,
but also for any unexpected reason that your trip re-
quires you to be underground longer than you
planned on.
5. CARBIDE 101
By now,
you've got-
ten you
hands on
that quirky
little illu-
mination
device, the
Premier
Carbide
Lamp.
not
only is
your lamp
your primary light and a valuable heat source, it's also
a wonderful source of cheap, flammable entertain-
ment. Please bear in mind that burning either your or
another caver's eyebrows off while playing with spent
carbide will likely haunt you when you come up for
membership!
6. SPELUNKING
"Spelunk” is the sound an object makes when it falls
some distance underground and hits water: DO NOT
DO THIS! You're a caver – take time to enjoy yourself
and your surroundings by caving smart and listening
to the suggestions your trip leader makes. If your trip
leader says jumping in a cave is bad, take their advice;
it'll save you a sprained ankle or worse. Also, don't
feel that you have to race through a cave to “keep up”
with the more experienced members. Caving is not
about speed for trainees, but for making sure every-
one is having a good time and learning. “Relax your
mind, and enjoy your cave.”.
