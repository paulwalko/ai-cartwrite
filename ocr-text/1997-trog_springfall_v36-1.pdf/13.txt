GROTTO GRAPEVINE
BY A.I. CARTWRIGHT
Dave Colatosti, finding employment in Christians-
burg, moved back to the New River Valley. Not sur-
prisingly, Dave Shantz quickly accepted a position in
Williamsburg, Virginia. Claims Mr. Shantz, “I wasn't
looking for a job; it just came out of the blue. I'm cer-
tain it was strange forces acting to preserve the Quo-
ta.”
BANQUET '97
Terry Brown and Carol Zokaites spoke at Banquet
about their continuing efforts at cave conservation
and Project Underground for kids. (Thanks, Carol.
You can never have too many fridge magnets.) Steve
Williams catered the affair and everyone ate and
drank to their fill.
The awards, presented by Mike Horne, were many
and amusing
Guano clusters:
Bat Ranch dwellers for their continuing hospitality,
Eileen O'Malley for editing the Trog,
Dave Colatosti for resisting temptation on a certain
cave trip (you'll have to ask him),
Cecile James for keeping the rescue gear and employ-
ing starving cavers,
Glen Davis for maintaining the club store for so many
years,
Lawrence Britt for hosting numerous caver functions
and taking over the club files and rescue gear,
Cap't Ed Fortney for the organization of many suc-
cessful practice rescues.
Other awards:
Brain Bucket to Bobby Zokaites for skiing off the beat-
en track,
Flameout to Ray Sira for ruining a sleeping bag at the
previous Banquet,
Driving to Sarah Cosby for destroying the bottom of
the minivan,
Crowbar to Steve and Anti-Steve to help pry them
apart,
Foot in Mouth to Joe Thompson for “threatening"
James Whisenhunt,
Viva de la Santo to James Whisenhunt for not beating
up Joe Thompson too badly afterwards,
Trainees of the Year to Joe Thompson and Les Good,
Annual Ripplemead Swimsuit Competition to Mike
Newsome (and his two buddies),
Salvage Diving to Steve Wells for rescuing Dr. Earlen-
meyer,
Honorary Membership to Jackie Hoell for too many
reasons tơ list here.
Don't forget Banquet '98 at the Newport Rec Center.
Once again Steve "Tink” Williams will cater the event.
This year the festivities fall on Valentine's Day, which
gets you off the hook for dinner rather nicely, doesn't
it?
COMINGS AND GOINGS
Once again Blacksburg's Dave Quota is maintained.
Old farts will be pleased to hear that Judy Perkins will
be moving back to Blacksburg in January to begin
graduate school. Could this be Doug Perkins' long
lost daughter?
OTR
Strange people impersonating VPI members caused
much trouble at OTR this summer. Accusations range
from senseless violence to the more severe “relieving
oneself outside of the Port-A-Johns."
The trouble lead to the arrest of Buckwheat Richard-
son. Thanks to him, the following phrase will proba-
bly be banned from subsequent OTRS: “More wood!”
Not to be outdone, Philip Balister demonstrated his
incredible telekinesis by randomly beating up on
women without even touching them.
TRA hearings will take place in upcoming months to
determine who deserves a wrist-slap for their behav-
ior.
WEDDING BELLS
Susan Vermeulen and Edwin Lancaster, living togeth-
er shamelessly, decided to mend their evil ways and
married on October 11, nearly two years after he
whisked her away to exotic Aberdeen, Maryland.
On November 18, after a brief and surprising engage-
ment, Walt Pirie and Lynn Richardson wed. Said Lynn,
"He kept talking to me at parties but I didn't think
anything of it. Then suddenly I noticed how attractive
he is.” Lynn and her two kids plan to move to Blacks-
burg at the end of the next school year.
OCTOBERFEST
Octoberfest gave cavers the chance to look through
club files at their new home in Lawrence Britt's
house, but this was small excitement compared to the
fish tank which bubbled up when you poured beer
from the tap.
Trainees took over the front porch and declared it the
"trainee lounge.” No reports on whether they'll host
tacky bands playing musak.
ELVIS GROTTO NEWS
Rumors that Elvis Grotto co-chairs have been caving
recently have sparked media attention. The Elvis
Grotto members are outspoken caving opponents be-
cause “people could get hurt”. Their persuasion
methods include riots at Friday night parties and
pressuring trainees to espouse their motto, “The Elvis
