Clip the top ascender to your seat harness, and

them into the cave floor.

brace it against the wall while using the other to
push you upward.
can be a big plus on low angle climbs. Just start free
climbing using the top ascender for self belay and
“clean” the slack that builds up between the two as-
cenders. Remember to keep the top ascender near
head level. Shock-loading an ascender can severely
damage the rope you are counting on to hold your
fall.

Virginia and the US that you might like to visit.

TIPS
There is no one specific way to set up and use a Frog.
One neat thing about this system is that individual
pieces can be easily removed and replaced. The keys
to creating a system that will work best for you are in-
teraction with other Frog users and experimentation
in a safe environment (i.e. close to the ground). Hav-
ing stated this, there are a few tips I would like to
mention. They might save you some of the trial and
error that Steve and I went through.
First of all, the right seat harness will make a world of
difference with the Frog. A caving harness that closes
in the front with a steel half-moon screw-link is what
you want. It provides a low point of attachment to
make climbing efficient, and also has enough room to
easily rack everything that is attached to the harness.
Petzl's Superavanti harness would be a good choice.
A close copy will probably cost less from a speleoven-
dor. The screw-link that closes these types of harness-
es can be a vulnerable point. Check to make sure that
the link is closed EVERY TIME before getting on rope.
You cannot be too anal about this, the links can and
do come open. Screw links are much weaker when
open, and there is a chance that part of the harness
could escape through the opening. Another thing to
keep in mind is how the rope will contact the screw-
link. As rope moves through an ascender/descender it
could spin the gate open.
Having a good chest harness is also important. It
should be easily adjustable by the wearer. While
climbing you want it tight enough to keep you
hunched over when standing on the ground. While
you are off rope, however, you don't want it com-
pressing your spine. There must be dozens of ways to
tie or stitch a chest harness for a Frog, so do not settle
for the first one you try.
The lengths of each tied piece in the system are ex-
tremely important for efficiency. The foot loops
should be short enough that the foot and chest as-
cenders almost touch when the legs are fully extend-
ed. A tether used to connect the foot ascender to the
seat harness should allow you to just reach the as-
cender's cam while hanging on it. If you are going to
use cow tails, the tip of the carabiner on the short one
should just touch your chin when connected to the
harness. The carabiner on the long one should hook
over the bridge of your nose. Use something like 9
mm cord for tethers and cow tails. I have seen Spectra
cord used for this purpose, but the general consensus
is that Spectra is not suitable for cave use due to its
small diameter. A properly applied section of bicycle
inner tube will keep the biners in your cow tails prop-
erly oriented. Ask Steve or me about this.
FOLLOWING UP
This should have given you some reasons to consider
taking a Frog for a test drive. I did not include sec-
tions on how specifically to build and use a Frog for a
reason. Experimenting with new vertical gear and
techniques is much safer with the help of someone
who has done it before. There are enough vertically
experienced people in the club that anyone who
wants to learn something new can learn it from a real
live person. Steve Wells or I would be happy to teach
you what we have learned, but we are not the only
Froggers in the club. If you want to learn more, talk
to people at meetings, parties, and vertical sessions.
