The Virginia Region spring meeting will be hosted by
New River Valley Grotto celebrating their 10th annual
Cave Escape. The date is April 30 to May 3, 1998.
Camping will be at Horseshoe Campground in Drap-
er (exit 92 off I-81). Cost will be $20.00 per person
(camping Thursday night, April 30, is free). There will
be a catered dinner Saturday night, and music both
