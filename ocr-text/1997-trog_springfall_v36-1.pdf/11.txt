WHAT IS UP WITH THE SAFETY COMMITTEE?
BY DAVE COLATOSTI
Phrases like “Big Brother is watching" or "Resistance
is futile” should not come to mind when thinking of
the Safety Committee. Ok, so what is the Safety Com-
mittee? Perhaps it would be better to first ask who is
in the Safety Committee? The Safety Committee is a
group of current and past officers of the VPI Cave
Club. The Safety Committee chairperson heads the
group. When necessary the president, with advice
and consultation of the membership body, assigns
the position of chairperson. The chairperson should
be a member who has a fair amount of caving history
with the club and who is regularly interacting with the
club body. The last chairperson was Ed Fortney, a.k.a.
Captain Ed. With Ed's departure to the dreaded NO-
VA, there was an obvious deficiency in the position.
So Mike Horne, a.k.a. Mike”, was deemed the next ap-
propriate choice for chairperson.
In the past, the committee was very "ad hoc" and re-
ally did not meet as an active group. The committee
functioned more as a reference source for the chair-
person when dealing with a specific situation. When
Mike came into the chairperson position he decided
that it would be a better idea to have a more regularly
functioning committee to discuss not only any inci-
dents that might need addressing, but also general
safety and techniques. So at the beginning of the year
Mike made a call for any interested individuals to ap-
proach him to become part of the committee. The
first meeting occurred with mostly current and past
officers, but there were also some new and prospec-
tive members present.
The committee has stabilized in its membership and
has had two meetings as of this writing. The people
that have been at both meetings are: Sandy Knapp,
Mike Horne, Steve LePera, Kirk Digby, Dave Colatosti,
and Chris Rouke. Attendance of other individuals has
varied between the two meetings, and it is too early
to say who is a regular participant as of yet. But suffice
to say that people are welcome to attend and partici-
pate. If you have not been to a meeting before, but
would like to attend talk to Mike or anyone listed
above. It should be noted that this committee is not
restricted to members only, and it is helpful to get the
prospective members' view of things as well. And
there are projects that will be popping up from time
to time that require additional willing people to help.
Ok, so what has this Safety Committee been doing
anyway? A wide range of topics has been covered. The
standard fare of the committee is to review any prob-
lems that may have been brought to any of our atten-
tions. This might be a small infraction of some
standard operating procedure or it could be a prelim-
inary discussion of a major underground incident
that will be covered at a full club meeting. The Safety
Committee strives obtain multiple points of view on
the situation, discuss the hows and whys of the situa-
tion, and come to some sort of resolution. The out-
come could be changing a rule, or a one-on-one
discussion with a trainee or reaction based on the
guidelines set forth in the constitution. The point is
not for the committee to walk around with a big stick
boinking people over the head and saying, “You did
that wrong,” but rather to maintain what I believe is
an enviable safety record. Letting things slide and
keeping the status quo can be bad for safety and that
is what the committee is here to prevent.
Additional topics that have been addressed include
what the club should do about keeping “Club” or vice
president ropes, which are not the same thing as
ropes in the rescue gear. “Club” refers to ropes that
are for general use on any sport trip, usually in the
possession of the VP. The general feeling in the com-
mittee is that it is bad for people to use rope on a reg-
ular basis that they do not own. The opinion was that
individuals treat rope better if they know it is their
own rope that they paid for with their own money.
One of the points of discussion that came up from this
is knowing the history of any equipment you are us-
ing. This is relatively easy when it is your own person-
al gear, but it becomes very difficult when looking at
club gear. This brought us into the topic of the rescue
gear. The committee started discussing what the use-
ful life of equipment is. Since none of us are experts
in metallurgy or polymer chemistry, we decided to do
some research with the various equipment vendors
on useful life of equipment and when it should be re-
tired. We also determined out of this discussion that
a usage log, which would include date of initial pur-
chase, needs to be created for every piece of rescue
gear.
Although we have not yet obtained any answers on
the useful life of equipment, some innovative ideas
were discussed to address aging equipment, in partic-
ular ropes. The idea was that rescue ropes would only
be used for rescues. Rescue training would use per-
sonal equipment. Once rescue ropes were used on a
rescue or a yet to be determined period of time
elapsed, the ropes would be sold or auctioned at a
low price to club membership. This would solve two
problems: 1) Keeps ropes in rescue gear in brand new
shape with no age problems to wonder about. 2) Reg-
ularly brings inexpensive like-new rope into the club
for newer members to purchase. This helps alleviate
the problem of not having "Club" ropes for the VP
and others to use on training trips.
Numerous training ideas were discussed, including
setting up sessions run by club members for some ad-
vanced, but useful, caving skills. Some of the training
programs mentioned were bolt setting, first aid, and
advanced rigging. There was also discussion on bring-
