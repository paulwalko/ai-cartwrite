A REVIEW OF MIRRORS KILL, BY JACK CURTIS

I was puttering around in the Fairfax County Library
one day and did a search in the card catalog for Spe-
leology. To my pleasant surprise, I was referred to the
heading “Caving”. Must be a caver or friend of cavers
assigning subject headings for the Library of Con-
gress. I wrote down the call numbers of a few books
that sounded interesting – the library has a decent
collection - and was intrigued to find a heading “Cav-
ing-Fiction”.
A novel about caving!? This I had to see.
The dust jacket reviews of the author's previous nov-
els promised a great treat in store: "extraordinary”,
"intricate plot”, “will be taking its seat in the hall of
honors”, “stunning”, “mesmerizing”, and “a pleasure
to read".
Well, Jack Curtis may have written some fine novels,
but this is not one of them. The characters are shallow
and unbelievable, as is the plot. The writing is pedes-
trian. To say something positive: he does succeed in
unraveling the plot slowly enough that I kept reading
the book to see what would happen.
Briefly, the story features cayer Tom Bullen. Bullen
had been used as a courier by a secret British version
of the CIA (the Friends). His international cave trips
gave him good cover, and the spooks paid his way
around the world. He is now recruited into finding
out about the mysterious killer(s) of his uncle, a
prominent politician. As the novel progresses Bullen
uncovers a multi-continental illegal nuclear arms sale,
finds the murderer of his uncle, and links it to other
murders which had been unsolved, all the while leay-
ing the CIA and its British counterpart panting in his
wake. He also shoots and kills a few people, kicks an-
other to death, and beats up a few others. Sounds just
like the life that cayers I know lead.
As it turns out, the subject heading in the library must
have been some caving cataloger's joke. Caving plays
a minor role in the novel, although Bullen's chimney-
ing skills play a crucial role in a couple of desperate
escapes from men with guns. I get the impression that
the author has caved once or twice, and had a terrify-
ing experience. Here's his description of a first time
chimnier as they are exploring for a potential hiding
place in a small cave: [Note: It is the author's choice,
not mine, to refer to the male lead by last name, and
female lead by first name. I am not even sure what her
last name is, it is used so infrequently]
“She was...pretty well dressed for climbing, but it
took her four goes even to find a horizontal balance.
Each time she slipped back, she felt the sting of a
graze on her back, through the tweed, through her
shirt. Bullen said, 'Lift your head up, move your
whole body backward, and push with your feet.'
"I can't look up in to darkness. I don't know what's
going to fall on my face.'
“Sonia got her shoulders to the lip of the ledge and
Bullen caught her under the arms. He said, 'Keep the
pressure on with your feet, or I'll be taking your
weight. Keep walking.' She went a couple more steps
and he was able to haul her back onto the shelf. She
sat with her head bowed for a moment.”
It should be noted that this tense climb was about ten
feet. They get down from this spot, but later have to
quickly go up there again as the bad guys are on the
prowl. Here is the description of Sonia's second
climb.
“She threw herself against the wall, slammed her feet
against the rock, pressed back with her arms, and
started the climb. Each time she gained height with
her feet, she pushed up with her arms, then jammed
her back against the rock in order to stay suspended.
There was pain she was going to feel later; while she
was climbing she knew only the headlines of panic.
"A moment arrived when she knew she wasn't going
to make it. Her back slipped several inches down the
rock face and although she tried to compensate by
maintaining pressure with her feet, she could tell that
if she lost any more height she would fall backwards
down the shaft. It wasn't far to fall, but the noise
would be enough. She was taking the skin off the
heels of her hands trying to lever her torso upward.”
This is not the end of Sonia's terrors in that little cave.
She and Tom believe that their pursuer has left the
cave, but they are not sure. She hears a rustling
sound. Is it the killer still stalking them? No, it is
worse, it is BATS! And they are using the chimney as
their exit passage.
“One of the bats nicked her hair, another touched her
cheek, and then they were all around invisible but
thick in the air, clogging it, passing in a tangled cloud
inches from her eyes. If they had a smell, she could
smell it; if they had a taste, it lay on the tip of her
tongue. Sonia gave a little shriek of revulsion and
threw herself sideways....”
And finally Tom calms her down by covering her head
with his jacket.
While I found Sonia's adventures in the little cave
amusing, they are not unrecognizable as a first timer's
experience with caving.
But what does the author think that cavers do when
they are not encumbered by novices? We first meet
Bullen in a cave in somewhat desperate circumstanc-
es. The cave is flooding, he is lost in virgin ("unchart-
ed”) cave, and he is solo caving. He is rapelling
(“roping”) eighty feet down, using an interesting
