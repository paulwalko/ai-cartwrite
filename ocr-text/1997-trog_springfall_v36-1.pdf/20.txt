technique, “paying out rope through the rapell rack
attached to his chest harness.” He walks through the
flooded room, towards a passage leading out, and
steps off a ledge hidden by the water.
Recovering as he falls into now chest deep water, he
finds a narrow squeeze heading up, and advances
through it by the “coffin length". "His shoulders
brushed the sides.” Horrors! He gets stuck in a curve,
and passes out from panic. "He felt the weight of
thousands of tons of rock above him and darkness ev-
erywhere; darkness lapping him; darkness like some-
thing solid he must push through.” He comes to, gets
unstuck, finds that the passage opens up, and leads
into the entrance room. As he leaves he thinks “Not
dead then.”
What is really strange is when the author expounds
on what cavers (who think nothing of chimneys and
bats) must actually be like. I have already mentioned
the comic-book superheroish adventures of Bullen as
he single handedly thwarts an international criminal
enterprise. But why does he go caving?
“Easy to work out”, [Tom] told her. “People descend-
ing into the dark to look for caverns older than time.
Think of caverns, think of Mother Earth, think of be-
ing in the dark, think of Doctor Freud".
When asked by someone else what he looks for
"down there in the dark”, he responds only “Dark
gods.” He caves alone, he says, “to test himself against
the darkness.”
And when a person is needed to conduct a life-threat-
ening sting operation to trap the last of the bad guys,
it is his caving psyche that makes him volunteer.
"Bullen remembered the narrow tunnel, the dogleg
that had trapped him, the unending, stifling black-
ness. He remembered that there was only one way
out and that was to keep going. He felt himself edging
forward into the dark once more. 'Me,' he said, 'it'll
be me.”
So, dear reader, if you are a budding author, it seems
that the field of espionage caver fiction is still in
search of its great novel. And when you've written it,
I'll be waiting to read it.
