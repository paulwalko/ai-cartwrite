Murder Hole
It was Saturday, March 28 and we were going to Newcastle Murder Hole. The
name itself gives a feeling of danger and difficult caving. It was going to be a small
trip consisting of Mike Mike Mike, Adam Hungerford, Chris Brown, and myself.
Chris and I were almost ready to come up for membership. All we had to do was
take the written test and pass our climbing test. Adam thought that the climbing
section of Murder Hole would be perfect for our test.
Since it was a typical cave trip we didn't get to the cave until about 12:30.
We then talked to the landowner, Mr. Sizer, for a little while. We were worried that
Mr. Sizer might not want us to go into his cave, but he was in a good mood despite
having a cold. We finally got to the entrance pit, and after Chris and I rigged it to
everyone's satisfaction we rappeled in. We all had been there before so we were quick
in getting where we wanted to go. We decided to take a look at Double Wells before
we did the climbing section. Chris and I were sorry that we hadn't convinced Adam
and Mike Mike Mike to bring enough rope to rappel it.
We then all went to the climbing section. I found it difficult to get down, but
presently we were all accounted for. We decided to look around awhile before going
back up to the top. Someone found a passage that led to a small room. That in turn
led to another room. The passage was situated in such a way that we could chimney
up between two rocks. Chris was first, followed by myself, Adam, and Mike Mike
Mike. On the way I noticed a survey marker on the wall and pointed it out to Adam;
it was survey station #43. Adam immediately concluded that we were near the
famous Slot 42, at which point Mike Mike Mike told Adam the name was Slot 43 and
we had found it. When we asked why it was famous Mike Mike Mike said it was just
a very difficult slot to fit through due to the fact that it is only 8 inches high.
After we decided to try and fit through it we quickly realized that Chris was
too big. Mike Mike Mike fit through with ease, but I found myself too large also.
Chris told me to take off some of my clothing. After shedding much clothing I
managed to squeeze through, much to my amazement! Adam tried next, and got
through with only minor scrapes, yet Chris still wasn't able to get through. We
played around for some time, then decided to go to the climbing section. After all I'd
heard about it, the climbing section wasn't really that bad; especially if you are tall
like Mike Mike Mike.
