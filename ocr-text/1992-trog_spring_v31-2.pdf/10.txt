affect the general well-being of caver-landowner relations for all.
When talking to landowners (discussing their well-being, caves, or general
gossip) never bullshit them or make promises you can't keep. They are not stupid. If
you promise to come back the next week to say Hi!, map their cave, or even do some
work, DO IT!
I have found cases in which members have promised the landowner something
and then never followed through (thinking it's no big deal). True, some landowners
don't care - but some do. If you think that a jilted landowner will later believe
anything you say, think again. I know I wouldn't.
Just because we're cavers doesn't mean we have to cave and party all the time.
What's wrong with taking one out of fifty-two weekends to help out a landowner? I'm
sure they'd appreciate it. If you weren't at Picnic, ask someone about the great amount
of work that was accomplished at Buddy's. He appreciated it. So would anyone.

A few last reminders:
1. Always leave the property with what you came with (or leave with more if
you see some trash lying around).
Leave gates as you found them. Even an open gate (if you are unsure about
a gate you found open - ask the landowner, never assume).
If you get out of a cave at a decent hour and you know the landowner has an
interest in his cave stop by and tell them you're out, thank them, and tell a
few highlights of the trip. Some photos of their cave would really brighten
their outlook on caving, caves in general, or the club. (But if you get out
late, remember to be QUIET --Eds)

Use your head and play it safe, don't do something you know is stupid. Think
ahead about your actions, most mistakes can be prevented that way. Good caving to
you...
