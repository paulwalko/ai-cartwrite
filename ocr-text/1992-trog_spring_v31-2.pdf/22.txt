Simply set the destination coordinates in the CAVEATRON®'s navigation
device to the desired part of the cave you wish to be in, and activate the
CAVEATRON®. Voila! In a matter of milliseconds, you should be in the cave passage
you originally programmed in!
Is the CAVEATRON® safe? We have tested the CAVEATRON® with two of
our research scientists, Fred and Bob, and the results of both tests confirmed that
neither man was anywhere to be seen after using the CAVEATRON®. Therefore, we
conclude that they both must be underground, exploring their favorite cave passage.
So, as you can obviously see, the CAVEATRON® is perfectly safe!
And the CAVEATRON® is cheap too! Right now, we are offering the
CAVEATRON® for only $19.95. That's right - $19.95! Did you hear that? - $19.95!!
