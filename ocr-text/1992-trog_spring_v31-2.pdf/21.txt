From Vinnie's Motorcycle Repair, Firearms, All-Nite Nude Revue, and Caving
Supplies comes the CAVEATRON®! As cavers and follows of the Elvis grotto, we here
at Vinnie's believe that caving would be a very enjoyable, safe recreational activity,
were it not for a few minor inconveniences:
• Having to walk, climb, crawl, or chimney.
• Having to carry a pack.
• Having to wait for slow trainees.
• Having to wear clothes.
Therefore, our Research and Development team decided that something had to
be done to improve the enjoyment and safety of caving today. So they set to work.
They labored long and hard through minutes and minutes of Star Trek episodes, war
movies, and beer. Through their long, hard, arduous labor, they discovered it is
possible to drink a minute of beer, after enough drinks beforehand. Additionally, this
labor produced a substantial byproduct: the CAVEATRON®. .
The .CAVEATRON® is revolutionary, and will set the standard of caving for
years to come! The CAVEATRON® will not only change the way you cave, it will
change the way you live! Not since the inventions of beer and miniskirts has there
been a recreational device so well suited for the human race!
The CAVEATRON® is a simple device which works on the basic principle of
matter to energy conversion. This principle can be seen readily applied in the
transporter on Star Trek. The underlying equation of this principle is:
E = mc2
where
E = Energy
m= Mass
c= the speed of light
Here's the deal: You supply the m, and the CAVEATRON® will accelerate you
to the c’ to convert you to E.
The basic components of the. CAVEATRON® are:
1. 10 metric tons of C-4 plastique explosive
2. Navigation device
