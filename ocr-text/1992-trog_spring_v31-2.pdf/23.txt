Pool-Caving-Darts-Beer
The all inclusive]
The purpose of this paper is to note the behavioral
traits of the subjects within the subculture defined
herein as the VPI Cave Club...of the NSS.
Many observations have been compiled by my fellow Research Supervisor of the
Unbeknownst (yet, known to us) Research Technicians of the Observational Research
and Data Gathering Grotto of the VPI Cave Club of the...nSS and I.
To our unbeknownst dismay, however, all
relevant research data was tragically
begotten by a plague of alcoholic
consumption. And unbeknownst to your
faithful Researchers...of the NSs, the
technically superior than thou computer on
which we are dissertating appears to be
under the influence of some techno-acid in
its own right, hence the lack of coherent
alignment and data procession.
As to the previous points, the rite of caving, as it is alleged or apparent call of
the club, as seen by the official name of the organization, is by no means the sole
conglomeratory factor of the Organization...of the NsS. Although it may be politically
uncouth to acknowledge the prevalence of alcohol, pool, and sharp tiny metal objects in
association with many of the subjects within the subculture of the...nSs, it be there!
In order to research this topic thoroughly, due to the apparent loss of the
apparently pre-collected data, your ever-reliable Research Technicians...of the Nss have
spent many long and tedious, although rewarding, hours penetrating your SIN-driven
Organization to research the benefits of the combination of caving, beer, pounding little
balls into various other little balls and thusly into various holes, and darts.
The Researchers of This Highly Intense Study...of the nss, officially deem a
correlation between the above variables, those being crawling in small dark muddy
holes, lots of beer, pool, and darts, is positively present, but because of the
