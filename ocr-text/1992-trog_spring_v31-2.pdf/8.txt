Much beer was consumed, but just like last year we ran out of folk before beer. As a
result the last keg was saved for a rainy day, and brought to Jim's for the beer hunt.
As picnic wore on people were seen smooching in the dark and doing the generally
naughty things they shouldn't be doing. The Elvis Grotto again played tunes through
the wee hours trying to keep the party atmosphere alive. All in all, a good group get
together.
Easter Beer Hunt went off without a hitch, the Sauna was red hot and glowing
for a good many hours; Jim had stocked up on pressed logs, The NNJG’s made for the
suitable party atmosphere while the Geeks clustered around Falcon 3.0 running on twin
machines. Watch that INS! Beers were found from a good many years past although
only the hearty dared drink them. The Easter Bunny was also observed to have
dropped several bottles of Easter Fosters®, which was enjoyed by those who found
them. Luckily, this time there were no problems with the law, though they were seen
patrolling the area at frequent intervals.
The old farts and the out-of-towners have been relatively quiet this semester,
with some exceptions. Jean Hartman is the jettsetter of the club; I bet your frequent
flyer mileage really adds up fast going to Turkey for a guy. Sandy Peterson turns forty
June twentieth; a party is to be held in Seaford and everyone is invited. Pete
Sauvigne's little girl is now big enough to go to college and that's just what she's doing;
the Simonds are going into the llama business - a new form of Picnic transportation
perhaps. A warning to Joe Zo, you'd better be prepared to kill the next time at OTR -
remember that loose lips sink ships. Linda Stoutenberg is preggers again, do you think
it will ever end? Jerry probably had some explaining to do after his fortieth birthday
party; it seems that the great balloon expedition was successful except for the marring
of the wall.
Things to be on the lookout for in the near future: The marriage of Brian and
Kathi, it's going to be in Tawneys. Be aware of women that seem a little too wild - all
might not be what it seems. Fifi just bought a house and a party is brewing, he's also
Admiral of Float Trip this year. The Elvis Grotto is hosting OTR's sound
entertainment, a cool group is playing. Rob French is going to Alaska for the summer
to work on fishing boats. This is the last year of VPI running OTR, let's make it a
good one. Try and check out Craig Ferguson's new wheels. Kinda new. He picked up
a 1960 Plymouth Fury, blue with a white top and major wings. Looks like the Elvis
Grotto got a squad car! Keep in mind the river is dropping and it's getting warmer, so
hats off to summer and we'll talk again when the next one of these comes out.
Remember, if you don't want it in the Grapevine - Don't Get Caught!
