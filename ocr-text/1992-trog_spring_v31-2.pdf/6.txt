a bachelor, he won a microwave. For Disco Fever the Elvis Grotto recieved a large
syringe. Jim Washington got the Brain Bucket, and Doug Perkins was rewarded for his
efforts as the VPI entertainment division. Trainees of the year were Patty Kitchin and
Jim Pugh. The food this year was provided by the Tech Catering Dept, and after about
twenty of us complained about food poisoning they admitted that it wouldn't be the
first time. The party afterwards was held at The Farm, and people other than VPI
attended. Most notable among those present were some of those NNJG folk, Mike and
Bob, who brought along a 330 milliwatt laser and proceeded to illuminate the clouds.
Another important player in the game who shall remain nameless stopped by at around
midnight in a patrol car - good thing Jim was still lucid.
Weddings this semester appeared to be the 'IN' thing to do, seeing as how
several of the folk around got themselves hitched. First down the list was Sug and Do's
wedding. Let's just say that if you were a minute late you missed it, as did several of
the people who came to see them say their vows. Yup, in only about 10 minutes the
whole thing was over. The same is not to be said of the reception, however. It seems

Koan and Jo were married next, the marriage that was to take place at Wind
Rock was re-scheduled due to blizzard - 5 inches of snow made for a white wedding, as
Billy would say. The lucky duo had their service take place in the War Memorial
Chapel, there was a large turnout even with the snow. The reception for them was also
held at Red Lion after much haggling with the Manager and a quick call to the A.G.'s
office. This was for most of us a first glance at the rest of the Takamizawa family, they
flew in from Japan for the ceremonies. I hope we didn't frighten them too badly! As a
prelude to this particular wedding, a bachelor party was thrown for Mr. Takamizawa
that just couldn't be beat, according to some participants. Said Doug Perkins "I've
never been to a Cave Club party that could compare‚Äù. After much cigar smoking and
porno movie watching for the guys, the ladies decided to drop by and show off a little.
In actuality, they showed off quite a bit, when you consider the fact that they wore
almost nothing, only their lingerie, and proceeded to strip the guest of honor and all
those around him. Wildness abounded, that can be assured - as they say a picture's
worth a thousand words and I bet we've got enough words to write War and Peace.
Joanie also had a little get-together that was held at Bogens, much to the
embarrassment of their poor waiter. It seems that some of the ladies there got a little
