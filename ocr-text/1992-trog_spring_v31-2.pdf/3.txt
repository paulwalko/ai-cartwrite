President's Column
Since one of the purposes of the VPI Cave Club is to promote cave conservation,
let me summarize some of the projects we've undertaken in that area this spring.
• The bat count in Skydusky Hollow was done in February in an attempt to help
determine the number, variety and location of hibernating bats.
The club set up a "hand's on” exhibit in the natural history museum one Saturday
in April to demonstrate survey techniques and the use of carbide and other lamps,
and to display different kinds of vertical gear (the focus was on safety and
conservation.)
Dave C.'s dream to adopt a highway has come true and is being overseen by Jim
Pugh. Already there have been two cleanups of the road in front of Tawney's and
Link's and landowners along the road have expressed their appreciation.
The newest project is the removal of spray painted arrows from New River Cave.
Many of you may say "Why bother?" but when you see the results of just a few
hours work you will volunteer to help! (HINT, HINT) Let's aim on having most
arrows gone by Christmas.
And lastly there are the ongoing surveys in the many area caves. If you aren't
actively involved in a survey, find one!
What are some goals for the fall? Besides continuing the above projects I'd like
to see the club more involved in educating people about cave conservation. Perhaps
giving presentations (small scale!) in the elementary schools would be a good place to
start. I welcome any suggestions in this area. We will also focus on approving the
updated constitution early in the semester. That could be tedious so I'll be talking to
many of you over the summer to iron out any foreseeable problems and make for
smoother sailing in the fall.
Well, we're ending this semester on what I feel is a united note. Many dissensions
within the club have been resolved and we are well prepared for any external
confrontations that may come our way in the fall. One of my most memorable first
impressions of the club is of the closeness, supportiveness and protectiveness within its
ranks. It is truly a family working towards the common goal of safe, educational,
productive caving. As you all go your own way this summer, let your quality caving
show that you are the VPI Cave Club!
