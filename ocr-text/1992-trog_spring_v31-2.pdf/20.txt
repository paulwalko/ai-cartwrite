The Rules of Bedroom Golf
1.
Each player shall furnish his own equipment for play, normally one club and two
balls.
Play on a course must be approved by the owner of the hole.
Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole and keep the balls out.
3.
4.
For most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft. Course owners are
permitted to check shaft stiffness before play begins.
5.
Course owners reserve the right to restrict club length to avoid damages to the
hole.
The object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary until the course
owner is satisfied the play is complete. Failure to do so may result in being denied
permission to play the course again.
It is considered bad form to begin playing the hole immediately upon arrival at the
course. Experienced players will normally take time to admire the entire course,
paying special attention to well formed bunkers.
8.
Players are cautioned not to mention other courses they have played or are
currently playing to the owner of the course being played. Upset course owners
have been known to damage a player's equipment for this reason.
9.
Players are encouraged to have proper rain gear, just in case.
10. Players should assure their match has been properly scheduled, particularly when a
new course is being played for the first time. Previous players have been known to
become irate if they discover someone else is playing what they consider to be a
private course.
11. Players should not assume a course is in shape for play at all times. Some players
may be embarrassed if they find the course to be temporarily under repair. Players
are advised to be extremely tactful in this situation. More advanced players will
find alternate means of play when this is the case.
12. Players are advised to obtain the course owner's permission before attempting to
play the back side.
13. Slow play is encouraged; however, players should be prepared to proceed at a
quicker pace, at least temporarily, at the owner's request.

14. It is considered outstanding performance, time permitting, to play the same hole
several times in one match.
15. The course owner will be the sole judge of who is the best player.
*Players are advised to think twice before considering membership at a given course.
Additional assessments may be levied by course owners and rules are subject to change.
For this reason, many players prefer to continue playing several different courses.
