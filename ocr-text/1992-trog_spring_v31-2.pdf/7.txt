out of hand and decided to see just how red they could make their waiter. Very red,
according to eyewitnesses.
Also married were Hugh Beard and Karen Little and Craig and Helen Roberts.
Folks went down and frolicked with both the couples prior to their fateful days. I
understand that Mr. Beard's wedding was almost postponed due to lack of groom.
Hugh, it seems, was quite incapacitated from the previous evening's entertainment. As
for Craig, he had a large turn-out, and a continual party was kept at the Elvis Grotto's
room... Club 201. Beer was always available, the talk was lively, and if you got hungry
you could always brave the elements and run across the highway. Even Kat Teten did
the ceremony thing, she went and married herself a Hsing I student. Ben and Lesley
haven't got married yet but there is still hope, once again they are a couple.
In other news, a large group of VPIers went to TAG for spring break. Some of
them had brief encounters with the law enforcement agencies. Scotty Boy and Brigette
both got speeding tickets, much to their chagrin. After the five car, eleven person
contingent arrived in 'Bama they decided to get lost, or at least some of them did. The
Scotty Boy and Kirk vehicle and the Dave C. and Scott B. clunker made it to the
rendezvous site at Stephen's Gap Junkyard/Campground, at which point they looked
around and said "Where'd they go?" It wasn't until the following morning that the
other three cars caught up with them. By that time they'd also been met by Doug and
Pete Bruce, who awakened them with the sound of car against tree. Pits were bounced,
tyrolians were created, Hoss holed his gas tank again, and sunny skies prevailed. To a
point. After that point it thunderstormed, it hailed, it sleeted, and then, dammit, it
SNOWED! Jeez! Can't cavers ever go anywhere without that little black cloud
following them around? I guess not...
Elections were held, people were voted on, against, and finally in as the debate
reached into the evening shadows. Our new officers are: Patty Kitchin, President;
Adam Hungerford, VP; Chummer, Treasurer; and Admiral Kirk as the secretary at the
helm. Let's all try and give them as much hell as we've dished out in the past. The
Constitution has been revamped but not yet revealed, pending more revampings. The
Elvis Grotto still hasn't been caving ( so they say ), but everyone else sure has. Trips
still are going out like clockwork, and some damn fools are going at weird times of the
night.
Picnic was indeed held this year at Buddy's field, he was glad we all could come
out. A barn was torn down to create the fire that sustained us through the night, and
many people were seen as usual taking the two wheeled route. Koan and Jo were very
noticeable on their wedding gift, a tandem bike. Rumor has it they only fell over once.
