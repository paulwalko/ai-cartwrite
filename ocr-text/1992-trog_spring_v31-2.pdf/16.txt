Food For Thought
What is a good food to take underground? This is a question asked by most new
cavers when they go on a trip that is a couple of hours long. Usually they will go to
Radford Brothers before leaving Blacksburg and get some assorted foods, watching what
the members and more experienced trainees are buying to determine what they should
get. I have seen people get sandwiches, bagels, crackers and cheese, tootsie rolls,
chocolate, and hard candies. The candy gives you sugar boosts necessary for instant
energy, and the complex carbohydrates are required for long term energy consumption.
Now that we have some examples of food to bring underground, how do you take it
with you?
Well, you need a container that is going to fit in your pack and will hold the food.
I first used a cookie tin, but found it would leak on any wet trips. Now I use a quart
Tupperware® container which works well because its rectangular, it is water resistant,
and the food compacts in it well. An important thing to consider when buying food is
to think about what type of container you have, and always buy what will fit. My
sandwich always gets crushed, but the crackers and cheese fit perfectly; it is possible to
fit them two high and four across which takes up half your food supply. Then I put
Toosie Rolls® in because they stand up perfectly in the container and can fill all the
cracks and spaces too small for anything else.
Lets review what we've learned... Remember to get simple sugars for the quick
burst of energy, and complex carbohydrates to sustain yourself for the long trip. The
container you should use for your food should be of adequate size, and being water-
resistant is a big plus. And don't forget, Tootsie Rolls® fit anywhere!
