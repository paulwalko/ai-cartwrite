A Few Words On Landowner Relations
As Keith Goggin wrote in a recent Trog:
”Caving is a privilege - not a right as some seem to
think. It is essential to note that no matter where we
choose to cave, we are the visitors not the guests."

It is disturbing to think that some of us are taking landowner permission with a
grain of salt. This is wrong. Our responsibility is to heed the owners' rules and do all
we can to keep them happy. Always obtain permission to enter a cave. Most caves in
this area require landowner permission prior to entering. Yes, some caves do have
blanket permission (we can enter at any time with little or no previous contact with the
landowner). We all know which caves need landowner permission and which don't. I
was recently on a trip in which the landowner had requested that he be home for us to
enter the cave (Newcastle Murder Hole). The landowner was not home when we
arrived on a Saturday morning, and one member on the trip assumed that we could go
in anyway. This was just after a group meeting in which we as a club had discussed the
fact that we weren't to enter the cave if the owner didn't want us to. This member
wanted to - BAD MOVE.
We also had a problem at the same cave this past winter. A member of the
Cave Club put ruts in the field on a trip. I was unfortunately involved in the sticky
maneuvering that took place for the following six weeks. Many of you did not
understand the severe nature of the incident. Mike' was repeatedly told he was over-
reacting. I was with Mike when he went to talk with Mr. Sizer, and it was obvious he
was not over-reacting. What Mr. Sizer was most upset about and “will never forget” is
that whoever made the ruts did not come in person to apologize or amend the damage
immediately. Mr. Sizer did appreciate us coming by to see him and check for erosion.
(Well? Was he eroding? --Eds)
The moral of this story is if you do something wrong (no matter what) on a
landowner's property, always admit to, fix, or apologize (preferably all three) to what
you have done. If you don't it causes problems for everyone. One caver's actions can
