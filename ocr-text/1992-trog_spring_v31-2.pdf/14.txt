Cecile enjoys catching me eating when she empties her mouse traps. "Look,
Laine! Two in one trap. Snapped both their heads off together. Ever see anything like
it?" "Thanks, Cecile, I'll just finish this pizza later. Maybe.” Of course, she's not
limited to exhibits. "Hey, Laine, did you ever watch a mother dog eat her young? It's
great." I didn't want that TV dinner anyway.
I'm descended upon. ”Laine, Laine! You stole the sand worm! You stole the
sand worm! Why did you do it?" I'm clueless. I've never even heard of the sand
worm. Cecile often accuses me of lying as well as theft and sneakiness. (That's because
Laine lies, steals and is sneaky--Eds)
Another time, just up, I'm groping for that coffee cup. My forearm is seized.
”Laine, Laine! Which is colder?” My forearm is plunged into a cooler of ice water.
"Ce--" I croak. ”My coff--” My other arm is plunged into a different cooler of ice water.
Yikes! "Which is colder?" It is demanded of me. "This--” (Plunge) ”or this?”
(Plunge) ”Cecile-- my coffee first --” I stammer piteously. Wunderwear is testing
cooler covers, and let the passerby beware!
From my bedroom to that first morning cup of coffee is a gauntlet to be run,
between the dogs, the occasional customers, the UPS guy, Cecile's secretary's small
child, and the seamsters. Mainly, it's the seamsters. Bless their ubiquitous hearts.
They are prone to observations about the life I can't help living in front of them.
"You're always cooking something," observed one. (You're 10 feet from my kitchen all
day. Of course I'm going to cook a few things.)
"You're so funny the way you come out of your bedroom first thing in the
morning and head for the bathroom.” (If I had been in your hallway when you got up
this morning, where would you have been headed?)
One worker doesn't have a phone at his house. He arranges to receive calls while
he is working here, adding to the general confusion of a house with three separate phone
lines. He says it saves him money and besides, he finds a phone ringing at home
annoying! This particular worker (not a caver) says, "That sure smells good,” every
single time I fix something to eat. I have gone upstairs to cook, just to keep from
hearing him say, "That sure smells good.”
Before heaving myself over the Ronald Ann barrier into my kitchen/sewing
factory, I can usually tell who is working there. Country music--it's our cutter,
easygoing Hoss Cut-Right. Classical music...it's Eleanor. WUVT or rock and roll and
it's a good bet the Chum is generating kneepads. 1960's and '70's tapes that drag
