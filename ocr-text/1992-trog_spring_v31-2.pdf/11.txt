Yufus
Being Yufus isn't easy, and if Yufus thought it were, it probably wouldn't be. When
the adventure began, reality hit Yufus like a six foot duffel dropped down Drinas by a
stealth pelican.
In Tennessee, Moni told our mission. We were to travel deep into Mexico to find a
small village located on the border of a dense jungle sinkhole valley. Past the fifteenth gate,
where the muddy road ended, we would ask the natives to show us to the opening of a
Grande Sotano. If the hiking were grim, and the Sotano big enough, we would call it Sotano
del Moni. This could be a big find, since road travel was the main way for ridgewalkers to
find virgin Sotanos in Mexico, and this road was fresh - it was not around in 1977.
Yufus did not go seeking glory, he sought in desperation for answers to his questions.
The travel thrilled him, and the rappeling aroused him, but his presence and being revolved
around getting those answers only The Cave Mother could properly reveal. "Why is this
happening to me? What can I do to make it right? Tell me the answers, Cave Mother,"
persisted Yufus, "I have to know.”
The reply Yufus got after four days of begging puzzled him enough to stop asking for
a while. ”Just wait. That's all you can do now, Yufus.” So Yufus went away to mope.
Moping became as routine as asking "Why?”. Whenever moping and thinking caused to
much confusion, the others were questioned and the moping continued.
When, after two weeks Yufus was still lost, he discovered how lost he really was, or at
least he thought he had. "To be, I must ask why!” said Yufus to himself, but he was gone.
No answers surfaced and he denied being. He was to told to be, but Yufus couldn't ”just
be.” There had to be something more, something better, some amazing reality, but there
wasn't.
Even today, Yufus asks everyone he meets "Why?" but no one knows the answer.
Even if someone could explain everything to Yufus, he still wouldn't understand. If Yufus
ever were to think he was being, he probably wouldn't be and if he actually were being, he
wouldn't realize it until too much time passed for anything to matter.
