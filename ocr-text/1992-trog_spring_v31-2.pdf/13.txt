Life at the Signout,
or Help, Help, I'm Trapped in Your Bathroom
Have you ever wondered what it would be like to live at the Signout? Ah, that
place of refuge for homesick students, that site of many a party, that meeting place,
that rendezvous, that sewing factory, that home brewery.
Yes, the Signout has many faces. Like the ocean, it has tides and like an erratic
but faithful heart, it is arrhythmical and pumps. And man, it pumps. But the pulse of
people and noise comes to a dead stop for two hours every Friday evening at 7:00.
From the wind chimes next door to the sewing machines humming; from Suki's
”Rrrr rrrr”ing and sneezetalk to the sound of Cecile's near-constant hammering,
pounding, and circular-sawing, the Signout has its familiar music. In my basement
room, I am treated almost daily to Joel's marvelous discourses in the back yard as he
admonishes the dogs.
"Now, Ronald Ann, I don't want to have to talk to you about this again. You
know you are not supposed to get in the garbage can. We have talked about this
before. I don't know what I'm going to do about your behavior.” As Joel continues
with great seriousness, I know I am not listening to Joel, but to Joel's father, or his
father 's father, or a teacher, or someone from any of our distant pasts... Looking out
the window, I can see Joel with both arms extended in the universal gesture of
helplessness. Ronald Ann sits quietly, cocking her head and looking at Joel with
reciprocal seriousness.
Ronald Ann! Part child, part goat and part Terminator, compressed in the witty
body of a dalmatian! Ronald Ann, brimming with enthusiasm, wagging her whip-like
tail so hard her rear end threatens to fly off her bony body. Ronald Ann, eater and
destroyer of calculators, shoes, rollerblade protective gear, special pens from Japan,
watches, seam rippers, knee pads, cans of spray paint, and brassieres. Ronald Ann,
delighter in bathroom trash can strewing! Ronald Ann, now banned from many parts of
the house by means of barriers. According to Cecile, heaving ourselves over the Ronald
Ann barriers all the time increases our flexibility. We're darned lucky to have that
Ronald Ann.
And then there's Cecile. Living with her is easy, and refreshingly unpredictable.
It's kind of like being in the eye of a tornado. A good tornado eye, that gets a lot done.
An eye that rips me up with constant humor, sometimes subtle, often wry.
