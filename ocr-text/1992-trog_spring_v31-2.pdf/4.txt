President of Vice Speaks
Well, here it is... the official and supposedly new and improved views of the Vice
President. First of all I want to thank everyone who elected me to this office. It is a
position that I have really been looking forward to doing for a couple of years (usually
something came up to keep me from running). I am looking forward to a great year of
"trainees”. Congratulation also to all of the newly elected officers.
The VPI Cave Club recently spent Spring Break ’92 in Daytona? Yeah, Right.
We were in TAG. We had a great time and were able to test our vertical competence
on all the deep pits and bask in the sun.
Congratulations to newly elected members Chris Brown (no not Jake), Kevin
McElroy, and Bob Cosby (recently elected into membership at picnic weekend). Now I
have to fill in Mike's shoes and find more potential members out there. Oh well, at
least I have a year. Scott Rapier and I have begun to restock the club gear and by the
fall of 1992 the gear should be fully repaired, coded, and ready to go for all the trainee
trips. One request I make is that if you use the gear TAKE CARE OF IT. The money
you gave us for dues paid for it all. Maybe it's ok to trash your personal gear, but are
you willing to trash someone else's?
Using this gear will be the usual influx of new trainees and interested parties. As
I mentioned election night it will be my responsibility to introduce the people to the art
and science of caving. It is up to all of us as a club to then expose them to the full
array of caving (photography, surveying, long vertical trips, landowner relations, and
conservation). Remember the more Crazy, Arrogant, Versatile, Experienced (CAVE)
dwellers they see the more like us they become (wait! should we do that?)
Anyway, no more lecture. Thanks to everyone who has already pledged their
support for next year and (if possible) let's try to top this past year's amount of new
members. As final thoughts:
• Stress team work while underground (and parties). Communicate and enjoy.
• Active cavers need to participate. Between GCCS, landowner relations, conservation
work, surveying, practice rescue, bridge sessions, we all have a lot to do. Also, Mike
and I are currently working with Craig county landowners for the APCO power line.
• Cave hard, party excessively, politic, anarch, don't stress over school and enjoy. And
if it is nice out, bridge sessions will run from 1 pm to 5 pm-ish on Fridays.
Yours In Caving,
Adam Hungerford
