The weirdest part of the whole trip was when we climbed out. It was still
light outside. What a strange concept, a quick trip. Needless to say, Chris and I got
our climbing signed off and we were ready to take the test. I'll always remember that
trip though, the trip where I climbed through Slot 43 and felt like a real caver.
