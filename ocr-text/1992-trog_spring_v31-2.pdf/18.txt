Cecile was sewing. Then we found another...and another.... We didn't know what to
think. I mean some people wear some really strange caving attire. We started crawling
over the rocks looking for more evidence. While observing the strange flat soled boot
prints we found what we were looking for. Right over by a small block of breakdown it
glistened in the light of our carbide lamps. A rhinestone, still in its delicate brass
setting. If anyone knows the whereabouts of the scooper please contact S.O.C.s.
