A 5:00am Bedtime and a 7:00 am Wake-up
Well, now it's time for us to get creative, as if we haven't done enough creating
for the rest of youse guys already. As our eyes glaze over for the umpteenth time and
we just catch our heads from slamming down on the keyboard again a solitary thought
echoes through the brain: Yaâ€™ll really need to take some remedial English classes. I
mean it. Really. There we were, stuck reading what you called articles and trying to
make heads or tails of them. We finally did, using a marvelous method that is known
in the editorial trade as completely deleting what you wrote and writing what we
thought you meant. If you like it, great; if not then you'd better express yourselves
better next time. Getting the point across is what it's all about folks. Think about it.
Our idea for future Trogs is that Trainees should have their articles published prior to

Captain Ed's and the Nudist Ko Bash, The Ambush at Mint Junction during banquet,
and The Great Flood that turned The Sauna into something from The Muck Lagoon.
But more about that as the article unfolds. It has been a rollicking semester, so read on
McDuff, read on!
This Trog's story begins early in the year at Banquet. Mr. Chris Stine made an
appearance as our guest speaker, and up until the last minute it was anybody's guess as
to whether he was actually going to show up. Chris provided an entertaining speech for
us along with what I'm sure was only a small amount of the thousands of slides he must
have had from his recent caving trip to China. Meanwhile, a small group of renegades
in the back of the room kept those of us who couldn't hear him occupied with a barrage
of complimentary after dinner mints. Rob French got an award for most likely to stay
