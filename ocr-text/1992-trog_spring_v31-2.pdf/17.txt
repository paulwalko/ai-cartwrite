Evidence of Previous Exploration in a S.O.C.'s Cave
One of the most exciting facets of caving is surveying nice virgin cave. In fact, it
is probably the single largest reason we go caving. One of the most depressing
possibilities in caving is to find that someone has been in your virgin passage before
you. This is where that nasty word scoop comes in. Therefore, you can imagine our
surprise and dismay when we recently found evidence of human activity in what we had
previously thought to be virgin cave.
I know you're going to ask me "How do you know the cave was previously
unexplored?‚Äù Well, let me back up in my story. First, the only possible entrance to
the cave was dug open by ourselves. Second, a short overhung pit further in required us
to set bolts. Thirdly, a complicated route through a massive breakdown collapse must
be negotiated before reaching the main cave passages. All of this leads us to believe
that whoever entered the cave did so after we had commenced exploration.
We were happily surveying down a stream passage when we encountered two
slabs of breakdown. It was necessary to crawl between the slabs before continuing. The
lead tape set a station on the lower slab, we did the shot and moved on. As I sketched
the cross section at the slab crawl I noticed a small lock of hair stuck in a 'V' where the
slabs came together. I yelled, "Hey you buffoon, did you get your hair caught in the
crack?" Then I realized my lead tape had blond hair, this sample was black. We
discussed how it could have gotten down here, maybe a raccoon, or maybe it was cow
hair washed in from the surface. Someone as small as myself could easily fit through
the crack, but a larger person would have to position their head awkwardly up in the
crack. Upon further examination we noticed the hair seemed greasy, not just wet,
(which it was) but greasy - like Dippity Doo or something.
We got back to surveying down the stream passage and more or less forgot about
the hair. Several hundred feet further the stream flowed into a massive breakdown pile
on the right. As we went up the rock and mud slope on the left we noticed skid marks,
then footprints! Somebody had definitely been here before. We had been scooped! We
set two more stations up to where the breakdown met the ceiling. Not finding any way
further on we sat down for a snack and discussed our situation. While we took turns
proposing various tortures for our scooper someone said, "Look, a crystal!". I reached
over and picked up the shimmering white object from the dirt. It was plastic! There
was a small hole...it was a sequin! We made a joke about what kind of caving fashions
