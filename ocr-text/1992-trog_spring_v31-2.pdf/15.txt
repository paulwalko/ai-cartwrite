constantly--"Downnnnnn beeeooooooy the rihhhhhhhhveor, I shot my baoaoaoaoby..."
and it's the aforementioned non-caver from Moochland. Redheaded Judy just listens to
whatever is already on.
Late at night the sewing shop takes on a calmer character. WUVT or NPR and
nobody in sight means that Cecile is in and out. Now's a good time to bounce ideas
with her, or study at the kitchen table.
The Signout is a great place to live if you like to be up on the Cave Club
activities, and your constitution is flexible. I take it in stride now when I come home--
at 2:00 a.m.--and 8 people are baking 22 apple pies, or Cecile is tearing out a wall. I
wasn't surprised to wake up one morning after a big party to someone's pleading, "Help,
help, I'm trapped in your bathroom.‚Äù (The lock mechanism had deteriorated). I
remain unfazed at meeting interesting cavers from different parts of the world while
clad in my bathrobe with my hair doing the bed thing. Certain times of the year, most
notably before TAG and OTR, the upstairs living room resounds with hordes of folks
running rope. I like the commotion.
Often I find a pleasant scene: the wood stove going, a movie on and the living
room pit full of people sacked out relaxing. Ko and Scotty-Boy--well, that's a whole
other story. In the summer, there's usually a choice of sunny or shady decks, and all
the tomatos you care to eat. Cave trips coming and going provide excitement and
confusion. All things considered, the Signout is a lot of fun. And here's a secret.
About midsummer, if you pick the raspberries for Cecile, she will reward you with a
little pie. We're talking heaven. And you don't even have to live here.
