A Reason to Live in the Big City
When I arrived here at Virginia Tech, I wondered what I was going to get
involved in for recreation. I first heard from another student about a cave club, so I
had to check it out. I had no idea that this cave club actually caved. (No, we actually
just party.--Eds)
My only experience with caves were those glorious commercial cave tours.
Before the club I thought that they were the greatest thing on earth, well, under the
earth. I would go to every commercial cave I passed when on a trip. I thought they
were the only caves. Being from Southside Virginia where there's no limestone, I had
no idea of areas such as Giles county (swiss cheese). On the commercial tours, I was
really bored with the walkways and the railings. However, I was impressed with the
natural part of the caves. I really just liked being underground. I always wanted to
check out the hole that they wouldn't let you near, and the lead that you could see
disappearing into the shadows. At commercial caves, they always told the story of how
the caves were discovered and explored. I used to dream about cave exploration and
finding a cave. I had no idea that one day I might even consider calling myself a caver.
Now I think I will never go to another commercial cave, because it would be a
disappointment. Caving has become a big part of my life. It has changed the way I
look at things, especially the way I view the outer world. (How? How, dammit? --Eds)
The Trainee Program is very good for people who know nothing about caving. I
want to approach every trip as a learning experience. Â·Any cavers out there, if you see
me doing something stupid, yell and bitch at me, tell me what I am doing wrong; all
suggestions and advice will be appreciated. Thanks to all you members out there who
took me caving. I really enjoyed it!
I will return to the farm after school because I can not stand big cities like
Blacksburg. However, caving has given me a reason to live in this metropolitan area
and attend school.
