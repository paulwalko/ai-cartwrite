A Different Clover Hollow
On Saturday, February 29 I went on a trip to Clover Hollow Cave. The trip
consisted of Kirk Digby, Steve Wells, Chris (the cadet), Kevin McElroy, and myself.
After Steve, Kevin, and I pulled Kirk out of bed we signed out and headed for the cave.
I was the first one to change into my fashionable cave attire (obviously a trainee --Eds.)
so I decided that I would walk to the entrance and start rigging. As I walked to the pit
I noticed that the little trickle of water that usually runs down the wall had turned into
a decently sized stream, hence a nice sized waterfall. When everyone finally got their
act together we gathered around the entrance trying to decide if we really wanted to go.
We made drysuits from our garbage bags and headed into the pit praying that the rope
we brought would be long enough.
With everyone safely down we looked back for our last glimpse of sunlight and
saw a spectacular sight. The sunlight shining down the pit turned the falling water into
gems. It looked as though diamonds were falling all around us. I wished I had brought
my camera.
After taking in the sight for a while we lit up our lamps and headed into the
darkness of the cave. We strayed from the normal tourist route and followed the
stream at the bottom of the canyon drop. It was interesting, we saw things like a 4 foot
soda straw. We then went to the library and played a couple of rounds of hearts, a
newborn tradition on Kirk's Clover Hollow trips. By this time we had killed six or
seven hours in the cave so we decided to head towards the surface.
Descending through the waterfall proved to be more fun than climbing back up
it. By the time we reached the surface we were all freezing and soaked but despite that
it was a good trip. We all got to see a different Clover Hollow from the one that
usually presents itself.
