had lost its wet, sleazy lead and replaced it with several dry, breezy, going
leads. I headed back without exploring further.
Back at the 10-foot climb I was shocked to find that my principal handhold
was a large slab held up only by mysterious forces. It was difficult climbing
down without using it,
I was now back at the top of the dome and it was essential to find an an-
chor so that a line could be permanently rigged for safe descent and easy re-
turn.
The slope started causing problems. Everything that was tuched moved and
fell so that I was required to spend much of an hour stabilizing rocks as I
searched out an anchor. There was great danger of undermining the boulders up
the slope a ways. After much effort I thought I had the slope secure. Sudden-
ly, with a crash and a boom a sixty-pounder jumped down the pit missing the rig-
ging but scaring the hell out of those below.
: No matter how hard I looked I could not find a suitable anchor. It was
about sixteen or seventeen hours into the trip and everyone, including myself,
was exhausted. There was not time to set bolts in this sleazy rock.
To my growing horror I realized I was going to have to down climb the pole
and leave no permanent anchor. I was scared of the prospect of such a descent. .
From the top it looked ghastly.
I tied into the belay, stepped to the edge and stepped onto the ladder.
I started inching my way down, reminding myself not to look up into the cold
waterfall because of my carbide lamp.
I was about ten feet down. Suddenly, darkness! My lamp was out in the
water. I worked through my pack and took out my flashlight. Light again! I
descended further. Suddenly the flashlight slipped and briefly traced a spir-
aling arc before it was smashed in the depths of the shaft. I reached for my
third source of light which was a Tecna-light tied to my equipment sling. I
had checked it earlier; now the damn thing refused to work. My third source of
light had just failed and I was stuck in the darkness!
My strength was badly sapped and I realized that I could only last a few
minutes. I tried to climb back up and found to my horror that my belay was
tangled with the cable ladder. There was a length of parachute cord tied to
me which lead down into the belay alcove below. This cord was for passing
miscellaneous equipment during the climb. This cord was now badly tangled
with the belay and cable ladder.
My boots were equiped with speed lace eyelets that were now badly tangled
in the cable ladder wires.
Things were all wrong and growing worse by the second. I was stuck, con-
fused and extremely cold. Hypothermia and exhastion were taking over.
On top of it all I knew that there was absolutely no way my friends could
get to me to help.
"Get me light!... Fast!" I yelled into the darkness below.
Joe hurried through the crawl to join Chris in the belay alcove and they
worked feverishly to aid me as best they could.
A light appeared shining up through the falling water from below me. Joe
was extended way out into the slot and was just able to point his light such
that some of its beam reached me. If I were to fall now the thrashing belay
line would surely toss him into the pit.
The strength in my arms was almost gone now. I had locked my arms onto the
ladder rung to hold on and was worried about retaining my hold.
Although my glasses were coated with grime and water, Joe's light from be-
low was just enough to help. I could now see that the cable ladder had wrapped
itself around the middle of the pole that was holding me up and that I was pul-
