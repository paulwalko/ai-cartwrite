If They Say You Can't Buy...
OOO
We have been exploring several facets of "price" buying
in recent DTC columns, but what if the store simply won't
sell to you? Though our lawmakers are quite willing to forcibly
induct you into the armed forces and turn you loose with an
automatic weapon at age 18, they won't trust you with beer
until 19 or 21 for wine and hard liquor. For that matter, you
can strap on a .357 and walk down the street*, but you can't
open up and drink a beer on the same street with out obtaining
permits--at a price of course. It is patently obvious that laws
restricting alcohol availability to normal people over the age
of majority -- 18 in VA --are going to be ignored, at least
by everyone except the merchant who stands to lose, his beverage
license if he doesn't become an unwilling cop. Remember,
"unwilling" is the important term. What is important is that
he doesn't feel that selling to you will endanger his license.
The most obvious and proven way is to get an older friend
to buy for you. This is particularly true for state store
purchases, as the clerks there are less likely to be as sympa-
thetic as grocery store clerks. 'If you must buy for yourself,
then try to look older- grow a beard or moustache, or don't
shave that day (or week). Think positively! It is your moral
right to buy what others freely can when you have the same
legal responsibilities. The immoral ones are those in the
legislature trying to restrict your personal freedons! In
grocery stores, try to buy beer or wine with your normal groceries.
If you're carded, there is the chance that you may just leave
the clerk with a lot of re-stocking to do-which he would rather
avoid, if possible! It is also less
likely that a liquor agent will
check a bag groceries. If the clerk
does ask for an ID, show it to him.
He may sell to you anyway, but he
wants anyone who is watching to at
least think that he's checking.
If you must buy beer and/or wine
only, then buy in quantity and look
confident! There is a good chance
you'll go through. If not, there
are plenty of other stores and you
only need one success that night.
Once you get your booze, don't
get caught with it!! New legislation
gives the Virginia courts the power
to revoke your operators permit
if you are caught and convicted
of under age alcohol possesion or
consumption. In particular, watch
public consumption. It is
illegal unless you're in a licensed
establishment. And public is almost
anywhere outside of your place of
