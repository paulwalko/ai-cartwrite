crawlway in frigid water, so we decided once again to turn around.
While we were recarbiding, Garrie and Wayne caught up with us.........
and we explained our dilema. They continued forward, but we
swam back down stream. About half way back Jim dropped his
carbide lamp in the water, which was all muddy by this time,
and had trouble finding it. When he did find it, needless to say, .
it had gone out. To by pass the last crawl of the warm stream
there is a climb you can take which will bring you to the top
of the dressing room. I did not feel like doing that sharp
crawl in shorts so I decided to try the climb. Now it is not
a difficult climb at all but I suggest that if you are ever in
the cave DO NOT attempt it in shorts. It will be a painful
experience. Back in the dressing room we all put on what dry
clothes. we had. Since Jim had worn my dry shirt through the
wet part of the cave, I had to wear my wet T-shirt out. Thanks Jim.
In a half hour, our dynamic duo returned with a most
interesting story. The water continued to get colder and colder
in the crawlway and following passages but the air and the mud
got warmer and warmer. The mud slide was fun, but the stream
was icy. We all headed out of the cave only to find it was
only about 200 outside.
The rest of the weekend was uneventful, except for Mother
Nature dumping two inches of snow on us that night at Aqua
Campground. The cold water in the cave was due to a major snow
melt beginning three days before our trip. Beware of Warm River
in the Spring unless you like a cold trip.
