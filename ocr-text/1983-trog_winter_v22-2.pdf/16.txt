ately, we were not to be so lucky.
The bolt climb progressed smoothly though 4 more bolts. In constant spray
from the waterfall, I was soaked and coated with grime from mud and bolt splat-
ter. Fortunately I was still pretty warm because of a garbage bag undershirt
and the effort of the hard work required to set the bolts. From the top bolt
the top of the dome looked deceptively close. Deciding that the top two bolts
were placed high enough to anchor the bottom of the pole, I pulled up a cable
ladder, rigged it into the top bolts and climbed down into the alcove for a
breather.
Here we pulled the pole sections through the crawl and assembled the 18
foot pole. After a short rest I climbed back up the lad der to the top bolts .
and rigged a sling arrangement that would pull uniformly from the two top bolts
in a redundant fashion that would be secure if either of the 2 bolts failed.
From there it was a simple matter to lift the pole, hoist it into posi-
tion and clip the bottom end to the anchor.
In position, the top of the pole appeared to clear the lip of the lead by
a foot or so. The stage was now set.
The cable ladder was secured to the top of the bolt climb and hung in a "J"
shape with the top end looping back up to the top of the pole. The top of the
pole was about 10 feet over from the bottom. The belay lead from the top of the
bolt climb through each bolt to Chris, belaying in the alcove. The belay did
not lead to the top of the pole because of the questionable nature of that sup-
port and the additional friction it would have caused in the belay. A free-
fall from the top of the pole would mean 30 feet before rope tension. It was
time to do the climb.
I climbed down the ladder to the bottom of the "J" and slowly transferred
my weight to the other length of ladder. As I did this I swung to the other
side of the pit under the drench of the waterfall. The anchors holding the
bottom of the pole creaked as the pole took my full weight.
The rig seemed secure and I quickly ascended and was soon climbing over
the lip at the top.
My lamp flame was very dim and I could see poorly. A high canyon passage
came in at the top with a steep cobble slope floor over which the stream flow-
ed. I stepped up this slope a ways and untied my belay. This I carefully tied
off to a rock. I re-carbided and inspected my surroundings.
The top of the dome looked bad. Everytime I stepped about, rocks slid and
fell. These smo oth sandstone rocks and cobbles were holding up frightening
multi-ton boulders further up the slope. A falling rock could easily knock down
the pole and tear away my belay line leaving me stranded. Just as disturbing,
there was absolutely nothing to hardwire a line to. The walls here were 5 in-
ches of crumbly shale with no holes or projections to tie to. The sandstone
cobbles were out of the question as anchors. It was like this all the way up
the slope. Bolting here would be very tricky. With this in mind I went ex-.
ploring.
I followed the canyon about forty feet up the slope where it abruptly en-
ded in a wall of breakdown and cobbles with no leads and the stream coming out
of the bottom. It ended!
As I turned to head back down I glanced up and spotted a fine tube passage
coming into the top of the canyon. I climbed about ten feet up the wall into the
tube and found that it continued as a spacious crawlway about 2 to 3 feet high
and 6 to 10 feet wide with a breeze. This got better and better and after about
80 or 90 feet I was soon standing in a small junction room with 3 leads going
off. One of these was a walking lead heading roughly east in the direction of
the other caves. The dome lead had done the best thing it possibly could. It
