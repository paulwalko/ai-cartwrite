Diddly Does
The Undone Dome
We started surveying Paul Penley Cave in January, 1978, and have accumula-
ted slightly under 5 miles of passage in the 70 or so trips that have been made
since.
Only a few leads are left and only one of these has true potential. This
lead is at the top of the waterfall domepit at the eastern end of the cave
where it comes nearest to Buddy Penley Cave, Newberry Cave and the other Sky-
dusky Hollow caves. This dome still has not been named although several names
have been suggested including Diddly's Dome, the Undone Dome, the Formerly Undone
Dome, the Aerobatic Dome, and Death Dome.
We have attempted to scale this dome 4 times using bolting and scaling pole
techniques with partial success. On the third trip the top was gained by one
of us and partially explored revealing numerous going leads. However, this
success was short-lived because is was not possible at the time to hardwire the
climb so that easy return would be possible.
The dome was discovered in March, 1980, when Bill Koerschner and Ben Keller
finally squeezed through the incredibly tight Fender Bender and found several
hundred feet of crawl passages. The dome was found near the end of this at the
end of a short, tight crawl. This crawl intersected the domepit in its mid-
region such that a rigged descent would be necessary.
I came back to the dome with Joe Zokaites and Sue Heazel in April, 1980, to
descend it and hopefully discover miles of lower-level stream passages. What
we found instead was a drop of about 75 feet leading to a drain which was too
tight to enter but which blows much air. The waterfall makes the bottom cold
and wet and caused us great discomfort. The pit must be entered through a tight
chimney-slot which made the climb out difficult because of constrictions. We
found that the water fell out of an inaccessible dome that appeared to go at
least 20 feet above us although we could not see up into it well because of
the water and vertical exposure required to look up into it. We headed out and
I didn't expect to be back to this hypothermic place. .
In April, 1981, however, I was back with Joe and Carol Godla to try
bolting out into the dome and hopefully gain access to the top. All the other
leads in this part of the cave had been checked, including other scaling pole
leads, and they had all died. The top of the dome was the only thing left.
With Joe belaying from the tiny alcove overlooking the drop and Carol
assisting with equipment, I climbed out 4 bolts into the dome. The rock was
extremely shaly and muddy. Fingers of shale and mud completely hid the sur-
face in places such that bolting was tedious and difficult. The fifth bolt
shattered the rock as it was being set. The quarter-inch bolts we were using
appeared too small for the sleazy rock.
At that point, the top still looked at least 20 feet away although it
looked like there was a good canyon lead of sorts coming in at the top. How-
ver, it looked way beyond our capabilities so we quit the climb, derigged
everything and headed out. I didn't expect to return.
A year passed during which time I constructed several scaling poles
which I thought would be easy to use in the dome. They were very light,
