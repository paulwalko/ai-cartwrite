Banquet weekend was a hit with the blizzard of the century
and the club was forced to cancel the dinner. The party, of
course, went on as planned. Robin Koerschner came the farthest
distance this year (Texas) but many others arrived in spite of
the snow. Don Anderson received the A.I. Cartwright Award;
Steve "Hair Rappel" Lancaster won the Brainbucket award for his
hair-raising performance in Ellison's, John Lohner won the PW
award and Mark Honosky was Trainee of the Year, Guano clusters
went to Keith Smith and Ed Fortney for trainee-training, and
Garrie Rouse for Rouse-Holing. Kent Thompson was given a bottle
of Whiskey for his work in the Miller Campaign. Philip
Balister was given a bottle of cheap wine for his excess as a
flame-out. Ed Devine won a jet pack to replace his scaling
poles. Dave Shantz came to town and left everyone broke and
hungover by the next weekend. Richard and Pat Cobb arrived
for Banquet and we found they'll be moving back to Blacksburg
shortly. Dennis Vaders brought his new Toyota 4WD pickup and
outran a Willy's and a Bronco in two feet of snow on Brush .
Mountain.
We had a great biunch of new members this quarter: : Kent
Thompson, Susan Meade, Mark Honosky, Mike Gaydosh, Al Ostroski,
John McDowell, Karen Michaelson, Mark Whitis and Mike "ex-ROTC"
Fütrell.
The club had an intramural basketball team, dubbed the
Fat Heathens. They didn't win much, but played exciting tackle-
basketball.
Keith Smith has been student reaching in Richmond at
· Clover Hollow (?) High School. Ben Keller is at Western Kentucky
and caving regularly in Roppel, Hillary Minich has been co-oping
in Raleigh. John Mummery has moved to Boulder, Colorado.
Lee Little is selling T-shirts, so remember to order before :
midnight tonight. That was what this writer remembers in his
sober moments this quarter, and we're looking forward to float
trip and picnic this spring.
