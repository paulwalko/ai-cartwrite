How To Be a Trainee
Being a trainee is great because no one expects anything of
you. If you play your cards right, your time as a trainee should
be the best years of your life. While you are not expected to
know everything, there are a few things that you should learn
quickly if you want to last long.
Bummimg gear is an art. Since it is unlikely that you own
your own gear, try to mention what you don't have to the person
who is taking you caving. Preferably this should be done before
you reach the cave entrance, but if you forget just stay calm
and try to be suave: "Hey man, you mind giving me some water?...
What about some carbide?... A helmet and lamp?"
If you make it to the cave, you're doing good, but don't
blow it in there. Don't rush to keep up with others if it is
unsafe. If you are in a dangerous place and want a belay, demand
one. You may feel they resent you for slowing them down, but
they resent trainee scum anyway. What will get them more upset
is having to rescue you if you have an accident (not that kind
of accident). Once a year they have a rigging session which
stresses cave safety because once you see the rigging you won't
ever want to be rescued.
You should be sure to enjoy your caving trip not just
because you are a masochiste. Be sure to look around once in
a while and take in the sights and formations. It should be
a fun and exploring experience.
One final thing, don't let this happen to you: "A change
of clothes? Oh, I don't mind going home dirty... What did you
say about your trunk?"
If you make it home you're doing great.
