sturdy and easy to construct in tight places. The larger of these was a 30
foot pole weighing about 45 pounds and the smaller was an 18 foot pole weigh-
ing about 24 pounds.
In June, 1982, a trip consisting of Joe Zokaites, Dave Cins avich, Chris
Welch, Keith Smith, Jim Rodd, and myself dragged the 30 foot pole and its
accessory equipment back the dome to scale it. The plan was to build the
pole in the alcove, section by section, lowering it into the pit as we built
it. It would then be hoisted up the dome and the bottom hung off three of
the bolts that we had set on the previous trip. This would position a cable
ladder which could be climbed into the dome. The full 30 foot pole weighs
too much for one person to manipulate so we decided to use only 20 feet of
the pole. The idea was for one person to position himself at the bolts at
the end of the chimney and manipulate the pole while the other two guys
in the alcove hoisted the pole from its lower end using a 2:1 pulley ar-
rangement. Jim Rodd and I had tried this arrangement a week earlier on
a cliff on the surface and it had worked easily.
In the cave it proved difficult to build the pole and the hoist arrange-
ment worked poorly. We finally got the pole up but the bottom was positioned
so poorly and insecurely that nobody had the nerve to climb the thing. It also
looked like the top of the pole was still several feet below the lead at the
top. Discouraged, we derigged the dome, headed out and swore we'd not be back.
On the drive back to D.C., Chris Welch, Jim Rodd and I discussed the trip.
The 30 foot pole was definitely too heavy to use and the 18 foot pole was too
short. What if we climbed a few more bolts up into the dome so that the 18
foot pole would reach? It would be easy! With this in mind we quickly for-
got the horrors of the dome and decided to return.
In September we were back. The trip consisted of Joe Zokaites, Chris
Welch, Miles Drake, Suzanne Danielson and myself. We were prepared for a long,
grueling trip. We hauled back just about every piece of imaginable caving
gear except a wetsuit. In addition to the 18 foot scaling pole packed into
3-foot bundles, we had cable ladders, ropes, vertical rigs, 1/4- and 3/8-inch
bolt kits, and enough carabiners and slings to start a shop. The day before
the trip I picked up a 4-inch brick chisel to aid bolt placement. This turned
out to be the crucial piece of gear.
We made good time getting back to the Ante-room and were soon sorting gear.
With so much equipment to sort it took most of an hour before we were starting
the climb.
I gingerly climbed out on the first three bolts which had been placed 15
months before in the questionable rock. From here the plan was to climb to
the side and up to a point where the pole would reach the lead.
Leaning out to the side, I found that the rock just to the right of the
area where the previous bolts had been set was vastly better in quality. Here
the waterfall spray had cleaned the surface down to steely-hard, clean lime-
stone. Unfortunately, the surface was a maze of fins and ledges caused by the
shaly nature of the rock. In order to set bolts it was first necessary to chi-
sel off 2 inches of this material to prepare a smooth surface. A sharp brick
chisel is ideal for preparing such a surface with minimal fracturing of the
underlying rock. However, this meant a lot more time required for the bolting.
While I was working on the wall with Chris belaying in the alcove, Joe was
busy in the Ante-room assembling the pole into 3 pieces which could be passed
through the crawl for final assembly in the alcove.
Miles and Suzanne were busy checking possible leads about a hundred feet
back toward the entrance frome the Ante-Room. We half expected them to push
through one of these and yell down to us from the top of the dome. Unfortun-
