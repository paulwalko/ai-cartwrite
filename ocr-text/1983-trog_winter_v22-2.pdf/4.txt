The Editors Explain
Last quarter, your faithful editors attempted something
nearly unseen in the history of this austere publication... We
editorialized about something -gasp!- controversial. Loading
but one round in our poison pen, we took careful aim at the cave
gaters of Virginia, squeezed the trigger, and calmly awaited
response from the quarry. Posthaste, or rather, U.S. Postal
Service haste, we got a 'letter to the editor', another first!
Evelyn Bradshaw, of the Virginia Cave Commission, wrate :to_ask
if we felt that some caves had been gated unnecessarily and
were we being fair about cases such as I-81 cave and Sinnet.
We again want to stress that we believe some caves might need
to be gated due to endangered species, formations and historical
stuff. Permanant closure we leave to the option of the land
owners. It's their cave. In our opinion, however, any cave
closure, whether by gate or landowner enforcement, is
indicative of a gross failure in cave owner relations. We
wonder how many cave owners these gaters have personally met.
Lack of other caver courtesy may take some of the blame, but
we think that the last resort' of gating already may have
been employed prema turely. Effective landowner relations do
not include going to the door and saying, "We'll gate it if
we can have the key."
Â· As to the TROG... We think this is one of the finest issues
he have been privileged to put our names to. None of this would..
have been possible with out the wonderful contributions from
all of you. Nevertheless, we are keeping a black list of all
of you who haven't given us a TROG article in the last year.
P.s. In order to cover our collective ass, we must say that
the opinions expressed here are strictly ourssi.andidonot
necessarily reflect the opinion of the VPI Cave Club.
