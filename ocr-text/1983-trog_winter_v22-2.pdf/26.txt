residence, including your car! The car is a particularly bad
choice to drink in because of the recent push against drunk
drivers. Even if you're not drunk, you're likely to be given
a summons for public consumption. Lucky, most police are
rather tolerant of drinking as long as you're out of sight ana
off of the highway, which is as it should be if you are going
to get plastered.
Remember too, that some states are not only interested in
what you have and who has it, but also where it was bought.
The greedy bastards want a 17 the tax money for themselves!
Dry counties also still exist---So just be discreet where ever
you are. If you're not seen by the law, no one will be the wiser.
The one liquor law that the DTC recommends obeying concerns
drunk driving. Here we have an established :fect: you can't
drive properly if you're shit-faced---and we want you to be
around to party the next time.
Cheers!!!
