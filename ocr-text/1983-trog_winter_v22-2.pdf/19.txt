A FOOLPROOF PRUSIK
Have you ever had your helicals come undone on you while you
were climbing rope ? Ever have to retie your knots while hanging
in space? Ever wonder why this problem arises in the first place?
There are two reasons for... this phenomenon. The first reason
has to do with the handling properties of tens tron. The stuff is
so stiff and springy that it is hard to handle. The second
reason is that the bowline, even when it is backed off, tends
to untie itself with the constant motion of climbing. Ever
wonder why rock climbers don't like bowlines? Well now you
know.
One possible solution to this problem is incorporating the
use of the figure eight into the tying of this otherwise
functional knot.
The procedure for doing this is quite simple if you follow
these steps:
1. Tie a figure eight into your helical line
2. Wrap the line around the standing rope
3. Trace the remaining line through the figure eight :
Pull it tight and you have it.
There are other advantages to this method, other than the
fact that the figure 8 is less likely
to untie itself than the bowline:
1. It is a less confusing knot to tie
2. The wraps can be made tighter,
making the knot less likely to slip
3. The figure 8 gives you somewhat
of a handle to hold onto while sliding
the knot up the rope
The knot does have one disadvantage
though, it takes a little longer to
tie. This actually is not really a
disadvantage if you take into
consideration the fact that you will
not have to retie your knots.
