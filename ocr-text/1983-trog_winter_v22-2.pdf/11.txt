Spits & Sputters
For those of you who enjoy that occasional dip or chew
Â· while caving and are tired of using a baby bottle cuspidor, I
have the answer. Certain to rival the Sony Walkman in popularity,
its the Walkman Spitoon. Made from an oxygen mask, PVC tubing,
and an IV bag (all available at your neighborhood Rose's store),
it can be easily assembled and worn anywhere. Put on the mask,
stuff the IV bag in your shirt pocket, and go caving.
