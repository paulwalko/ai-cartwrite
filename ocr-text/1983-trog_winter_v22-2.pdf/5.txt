Once again the troglodytes of Southwest Virginia are to be
subjected to the most dreadful threat since Jesse Helms took
office, the worst disease since "combination skin" and the
biggest insult to intelligence since "That's Incredible". You're
right--you've guessed it--its the return of the....
Grot to Grapevine
Â· The winter season once again belched on Blacksburg and
hampered alot of cave trips including the practice rescue, but
there was still plenty of underground activity. Tech cavers
made trips to Warm River, Ellison's and Roppel over Christmas
break. During the quarter, Philip Balister, Steve Conner,
Keith Smith, Win Wright and others dia the Waterfall Pit in the
new section of Banes Spring and found a twisting passage with
more pits still to be attempted. After two mapping trips and
three digs, Jim Washington and Garrie Rouse finished the
Sam Hancock's System with 475 feet of passage. Janet Queisser
has started mapping and, surveying Arrett Mill Railroad Tunnel Cave
in which Walt Pirie found some surprising new passage.
In spite of a snowy weekend, the ridgewalk in Russell
County produced results: 2 definite and 3-4 possible caves.
"Surveying trips will return later. The rigging session at
Pighole had a great turn out. The practice rescue has been
rescheduled for April 9; hopefully we won't get another 6 inches ..
of snow. Frank Gibson has been seen experimenting with cave
flash photography "Phantom style" and suffering from dialated
pupils. Hugh Beard and Dave Cinsavich found that you can see
all of Link's Cave and get back for a 1:30 Redskin Kick-off.
Garrie has been "Rouse-holing" in Windy Mouth. Joe & Carol
Zokaites are still plugging away with the Newberry's survey.
Lawrence Britt has found two new passages in Starnes Cave: a
dig. that we caught Moose Dawson helping with, and the "bellyflop"
crawl : that leads to some promising trunk passage.
Stephen Lancaster, Maureen Handler, Jim Washington and
Al "Who" have been ratholing in two new caves in clover Hollow.
Ed Devine keeps insisting in perfecting his scaling poles.
He also keeps insisting on finishing the Paul Penley's survey,
and is now as far as Diddly's Undone Dome.
Between caving trips, the sewers in Blacksburg were flowing
full of vomit as usual from assorted Friday night parties and
other acts of over-indulgence. The flow of puke was diverted
to Rapidan over New Year's at the Richardson's annual orgy.
Finding no trainees in their midst, the members didn't have
to maintain their cool. At 5:30 in the morning, a puke line
formed in front of the bathroom. They also had one of the best
hayrides ever. The over flow from the toilet went right
outside. Upchuck and Splat Shorten definitely lived up to their
nicknames and puked 6 times between the two of them. Hugh
Beard had a Superbowl Party highlighted by a bluegrass
"Hail to the Redskins" with every score. A massive high-five was
had at the end of the game.
