Speleorata ****
Cave softly amid the pretties and nasties, and
remember what true: peace there may be in rappelling.
are truly masochistic. Carry first-aid. Encourage
membership in the NSS, and write for the publi-
cations even though cave politics be for turkeys.
If a person appears in doubt of who he is, he
may be a speleopolitician. Beware. Consider
that if two rights and a wrong go to a dead end,
a right and two lefts may not get you back to
where you remember. Whenever possible, use
Suuntos instruments. Be comforted in the face
of rising streams and sudden rockfalls, that
despite the fact that your wallet is all wet,
someone will come to get you out in four to six
hours. Strive not to eat cave creatures, dead
or alive. Remember Roppel, and keep it holy.
Exercise reasonable caution, especially in
virgin territory. Know not no knot, and know .
what knot to use when. Be assured that pushing
wet sumps by carbide light often will leave you
in the dark. Therefore, attempt not naked the
"Grim Crawlway of Death."
Surrender gracefully the things of youth:
solvency, sobriety, Moral Majority, and keep
not your gorp in plastic bags. For a good time,
remember to remove your carbide lights before
engaging in oral sex. Be heartened amid
impending starvation that the stuff at the
bottom of your pack is possibly edible, if you
scrape it first, and reflect that, however
miserable you may feel, it only would be worse
on a photo trip.

You, caver, frequently push the limits of your
endurance, but please call it guano when it
sticks to your overalls. You are privileged
to go to Hell, provided you embrace agreeable
politics and have landowner permissian. There-
fore, learn to abide grotto functions, pay
your dues, party, but not to excess, leave gates
as you found them, and remember to carry three
sources of light. Keep always in mind, never-
theless, that caving is an activity peculiar
to the living. Be safety conscious, and enjoy.
