"Stymie" Speaks:
Alas, (or at last) my term as president is drawing to a
close. Looking back, I'm very pleased with the accomplishments
of the club. The grotto is growing and passing on the knowledge
and the traditions to the record number of new members who
have joined our ranks! .
When Keith and I were elected to office, we set a few goals
that we thought were pertinent to maintaining the strength of
the VPI Cave Club. With the help of a lot of club members,
most of these goals have been achieved. These include the boost
in membership, the vertical sessions on the bridge, and the
rigging session at Pig Hole. The ridge walk which Win Wright,
Carol Trexler and Hillary Minich organized was quite a success.
We located several entrances and we will be returning to
Russell County this spring to start surveying our finds. The
practice rescue that was planned was snowed out, but it has
been rescheduled for April 9th at New River Cave,
Elections will be held in April, so it is time for all
you regular members to evaluate your own officer potential.
If you think you have the time and determination to fill a
position, go for it! If you know someone else who could do a
good job in office, encourage him or her to go for it! The club
is strong now, and with all of the eager new cavers we have
now, it can get even stronger if everyone approaches the elections
with the seriousness that they deserve.
I hope everyone is planning to have as good a spring
quarter as I am. I am cutting back on my school load so. I can
do maximum caving, climbing and partyingi After all, you can't
let your school work interfere with your education!
Keep on Cavin'!
