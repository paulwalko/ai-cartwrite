Real Cavers Dout Do Politics-
-Real Cavers Go Caving!!
In the past, it was easy to be a Real Caver. All you had
to do was find 2 others to go underground, talk to land owners,
drink yourself blind and party.
But today, Real Cavers are expected to cope with things
like cave gates, super racks, 1000+ people at Old Timers, and
cave closings.
So how, then, does a Real Caver survive in a society filled
with cave politicians and cave gaters? Read on:
