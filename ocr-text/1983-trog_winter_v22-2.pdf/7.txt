The Legend
of Air Rappel
Sunday, the day before exams
Up the road the cave they found.
"OK, check, you've got your cams?"
A perfect day for underground.
Don and Keith and Pete and Lee,
Our fabulous four of caving lore,
Rigged the rope to nearest tree,
The Clover Hollow Cave to see.
They knew what real caving meant;
A bust-ass trip they had in mind.
So, blithely down the rope they went,
Four men true punishment to find.
One last look at sky of blue,
The rope tied off to nearest rock,
And down the breakdown trunk they flew-
No stop to hesitate and talk.
Past the short tight, nasty crawl,
The stradale canyon's awkward climb,
They arm-rappelled the flowstone wall.
- The entrance part in record time.
Next in line, the twelve-foot climb.
Don stayed top to rig the drop.
Pete and Keith free-climbed the thing,
And Lee would wait 'til Don was done.
Then, down he climbed without belay,
His gloves he held between his teeth.
The cable ladder wouldn't sway,
And Keith was waiting underneath.
Two rungs down, and then he thought,
And one more rung, and he did see
Just what would pass if hands got caught?
How difficult to get them free!
Now Lee was bright; he knew the scene.
If hands can't move, neither can you.
No seconds lost, the ex-Marine
Freed both hands, and down he flew.
