Carts from PSC, Eric and I did a triple push on a

Crack", it is an overhanging, strenuous crack, with
"manky" chock placements. This crack led to another alcove,

sheer exposure, on the wall of the big pit itself.
We hope our aid project leads to more cave, maybe even a
connection to a cave nearby.
