WARM? RIVER
From the time I first joined the cave club, I heard rumors
of a cave with hot, spring-fed water, I heard fantastic tales
of cavers shedding all clothing but boots, helmets and packs
and swimming nearly nude through the tepid stream. It sounded
like an incredible amount of fun and being an adventurous sort,
I resolved some time to go to Warm River Cave.
On the Saturday before Christmas, my resolve became fact.
On that cold December morning, after several hours of the
obligatory delay, our party of nine headed out of Blacksburg in
five vehicles. Jim Washington and I rode the Mudmobile; Garrie
Rouse and Mark Honosky braved the Great White Whale. Jack Kehoe
soloed in his inimitable VW, and three friends of Wayne Burstein
brought him along on one of their two conveyances. After the
inevitable 'Ohh ahh' at the roadside falling springs waterfall
(whose water partially comes from Warm River Cave), we arrived
at the house of the landowner only to find a number of friendly
dogs and no landowner present. Wayne, who had been there before,
assured us that this was no problem, and after leaving an ..
appropriate note at the door, we headed up to the cave.
Leaving our own dry street clothes outside the entrance, we
climbed down and down. Contrary to what I had heard, this was
not a friendly cave. We were obliged to trust an ancient
tree someone had brought in as a scaling pole. Ugly, sharp
rocks presented themselves everywhere, but finally, Wayne
recognized the flat, tilted rock that was the floor of the
"Dressing Room."
A few of us 'brave' ones, stripped down to various stages
of undress in preparation for the warm water. Then we climbed
over some breakdown to begin wading. Wayne noticed that the
water was about a foot higher than he remembered. Jim and
Garrie swore that the stream was warmer than Old Mill, but I
did not believe that it was over 550. We headed upstream
about twenty feet to where the water was chest deep with about
four inches of air space. Garrie went through, then I tried,
but was too cold. We decided that it was pointless to try
to take the entire party upstream to find the warm water, so,
disappointed, we started out of the cave.
Just before we got back to the dressing room, we found a
small warm pool. It was wonderful after the cold water. Hot
tub, here we come! At the end of the pool was a near siphon.
This was the way to go. We were on our way to the 'Cool Pool'
earlier. What a mistake. Wayne stayed with the hypothermic
Rouse while the rest of us started upstream.
They would follow when Garrie was warmer.
We then negotiated two more near siphons as we floated and
crawled upstream. The water, which was at about 700 when we
started, did not get appreciably warmer as we had expected. At
the rimstone dam it indeed began to drop. Our next obstacle was a
