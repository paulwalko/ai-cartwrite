ling dangerously against it.
With the help of Joe's light I was able to free the ladder from the pole
with my feet and unhitch my boots from the ladder wires. However, the para-
chute cord was fast stuck. Fortunately, Joe was able to burn through the cord
with his carbide lamp and we were soon free of it.
I was now free to descend! Moments later I was near the bottom of the "J"
in the ladder.
Unexpectedly, without warning, my grip on the ladder failed and I was
swinging free! Because I was at the lowest part of the ladder, I just harm-
lessly swung a short ways toward the slot and grabbed the ladder again. I
later realized that if I had climbed back up the ladder earlier, as I had tried
to, this fall might have occured from the top of the ladder with catastrophic
results.
With great difficulty and a strong pull from Joe, I was able to wedge into
the slot and slide into the alcove where I collapsed to the floor exhausted,
numb and confused; shivering uncontrollably from hypothermia.
After kissing the floor for long moments, I struggled through the crawl and
into the Ante-Room where Miles and Suzanne were waiting, also cold and miser-
able. The leads they had been checking had stopped them 8 or 9 hours earier,
and they had been waiting in the Ante-Room since then. Their leads had con-
tinued but were apparently so tight that even Miles, well known as a super-
digger and lead pusher, could not get through. He planned to return with bet-
ter digging and prying equipment.
We were in such an exhausted, hypothermic state that we decided to abandon
the climb and leave all the equipment rigged, including the scaling pole on the
wall. The only things we took out were the small things that might be damaged
by prolonged exposure to damp air.
The trip out was very rough in the beginning because of our physical state.
However, most of the trip out is in dry crawlways so we recovered after sev-
eral hours. We exited the cave into the early morning. Valuable lessons were
learned and reinforced regarding waterfalls, good electric rigs, and over-ext-
ending abilities.
We knew we'd be back because of the mountain of gear we'd left. We also
thought it would be easy to do the climb again since it was all set up.
A crew consisting of Chris Welch, Miles Drake, Dave Cinsavich, Win Wright
Bruce Beard and myself returned a month later. In addition to attempting
the climb again and de-rigging the climb, we were prepared to push Miles' digs
with renewed vigor and better equipment. After thinking though the events of
the previous trip, a method of hardwiring the dome occured to me that would
require about sixty feet of rope. In the confusion of the previous trip I
had not seen it. It involves tying the rope off through a tight constriction
that exists at the top.
Although we thought this trip would be a breeze, technical complications oc-
curred and we failed to make it up the climb. Both Chris Welch and I attempted
it but neither of us made it more than half-way up the ladder. Exhaustion and
a tangled belay on the bottom of the pole stopped us just short of success.
However, the trip was pleasantly free of the frightening near-misses that the
previous trip had experienced.
Miles found that the dig leads were much too tight to get through.
We de-rigged and hauled everything out after a long and discouraging trip.
I said I'd never return but we're working on a new tactic that is just sure
to work.
