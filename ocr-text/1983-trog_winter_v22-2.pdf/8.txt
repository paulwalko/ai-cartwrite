Well, Lee's a real good guy and all,
But sad to say, a little dense,
To try to break the basic laws
Of Gravity and Common Sense.
In spite of this, and not to be
Outdone by Newton's apple,
He really did a super dive,
The famous Air Rappel.
And it's twelve feet down, another ninety below, .
If you lose your grip in Clover Hollow.
We can't lose that guy the girls all know,
Let's all go to Clover Hollow.
He did a back one-and-a-half, with a balf twist, landing in a
t√ºcked position on top of Keith, who, after all, was right there,
and who, fortunately for our free-falling friend, forced the
flying fool far enough from the floor fissure to refuse him the
fierce euphoria of falling further.
But it's twelve feet down, another ninety to go,
If you bounce just right in Clover Hollow.
We can't lose that guy the girls all know,
Let's all go to Clover Hollow.
