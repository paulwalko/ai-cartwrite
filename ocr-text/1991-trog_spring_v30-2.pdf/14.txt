OBSCENE EXCITEMENT 11; the sequel
He was breathing heavy when I reached down his hot, wet front and
groped for the belt that was tied in a square knot. Try as I might, I
couldn't get the knot out soon enough. It was too tight for me to get a good
grip. There wasn't enough room. He had to help me get the belt off. I
couln't help myself and I took over undressing him again.
I tried being aggressive by ripping off his field pants button, but it
slid through with a gentler touch. After his button was freed, he exploded
forth through the zipper. He came at me and placed his strong hand on my
thigh. He pushed... right past me in the tight passage. I know what you all
are thinking, and you are disgusting! Hoss, as usual, got stuck in a crawl in
Old Mill cave.
The 300 feet that we did see was very nice, but our journey was cut
short by the fact that it rained the entire month of February (What's new
in Blacksburg?). The six members of this motley crew were in wiast deep
water discussing how the other room should be only five feet ahead.
Sara's Anthropology Professor said that he wouldn't be joining us through
the submerged tunnel. I am glad I wasn't the only wuss who wasn't up for
underwater caving without a wetsuit and oxygen tank!
There were lots of pretties, but we took a wrong turn that led to
Hoss' situation. Honestly I tried to help, I told him which direction he
should move. Being a typical male, He said taht it wouldn't work until it
seemed like his idea. A woman's work is never done when they have to
straighten out the men.
Hoss hauled his naked butt through the last twenty feet of the cave so
fast I didn't even see his combat boots when I looked up. COLD, WET,
satisfied and hoping I never see Hoss' naked backside again!
