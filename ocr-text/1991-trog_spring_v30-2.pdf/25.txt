Caving
We have come from every background, every situation, we work or play at
diverse occupations. wee are very young and very old. Yet, there is a common bond
and every one knows why they are leaving this hillside under the wet green of spring to
clamber into a dark m moss bedecked crevice. Virtually all thoughts fo the world above
are abandoned as lamps are checked and loaded and packs are donned in quiet
preparation. As you descend into this "other' world, it is difficult to remain unmoved as
you observe the result of untold years in the spendor of the formations surrounding
you. The frozen liquid avalanches of flowstone, the delicate beauty of soda straws and
crystals. On many stalagtites the mechanism of their creation is still evident as the
droplets dangle from their tips and glow eerily in the carbide light. Even the strangely
twisted sometimes grotesque passages echo the anguish of their birth, Peaceful
waterfalls and clear streams forming rimrock pools meander out and back into the path
unexpectedly under translucent curtains of stone. The abundance of breakdown and
the immensity of God rocks inspire awe and a clear awareness of the tenuous nature of
our existance. And then the work begins, rigging and padding ropes, checking knots
and gear, finalizing plans, and the first caver is down and off rope. Each waits his turn
in order dictated by caving skill and experience rather than the convention of age, sex,
or status to achieve maximum saftey should problems arise. As you hook onto the
rope and leave the saftey of the ledge, you must comprimise the urge to fly down the
rope in order to get a good look at the scenery. Suddenly a stream opens out from the
wall to rain on you further down the drop and though soaked you are almost
dissapointed to see the ground approaching. Steam rises from your clothing as you
rest and wait for the last of the caves to descend to continue the trek over, under and
through. Wait a minute, nobody could get through that hole but one by one you do,
climbing, crawling adn squeezing through a natural jungle gym.
On the way back out, you wait in your carbide tent for your turn to climb. Each
step takes you further from the saftey of the cave floor and you concentrate on the
illuminated wall close by you as you labor up the rope. the muted voices of the cavers
above and below echo and become indistinct as you climb and it seems appropriate,
that we take care not to disturb the cave gods. The bats are skimming past now up the
through the opening above which is your goal- it must be close now. Tired but warm
from climbing, you coil the ropes and repack equipment- it's time to go. As you see
daylight oozing around the last bend and smell the sweet warmth of the aging day, you
feel elated for those who have made the journey emerge transformed and view a
world made less predictable, less complacent because of the knowledge of the world
below- another dimensin where bats glide through darkness as they have through the
milennia and watch their strange pale relatives grope through the muddy maze that is
their home.
