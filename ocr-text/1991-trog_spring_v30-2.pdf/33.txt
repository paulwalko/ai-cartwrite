.
- ace it, when you're on your way down some things just aren't good enough. For one thing,
cotton just doesn't do the trick. And then there's wool, which can absorb 6 to 8% of its
· weight in water. And what about those caving clothes made for paper dolls!
Ictire the old die-hards and use Wunderwear.
B&C's got everything from a cordura version of
your old “jean” jacket to fleece hoods, coveralls
to fleece sweaters, long johns and wooly suits to
bib-overalls. Whatever you need we probably
make it, and if we don't make it we will.
justoin orders are welcome.
Whether it be your own
design, or modifications to
ours.
