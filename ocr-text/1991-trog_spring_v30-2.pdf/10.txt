The limestones in the area are middle Ordovician in age. They lie
below the shales and sandstones and above the dolomite.

For the most part the valleys are dolomite and limestone with
sandstone holding the ridges high. Dolomite and limestone are almost
identical looking. They are usually grey and "smooth skinned" massively
bedded rock. Dolomite is less soluble than limestone and less conducive
for forming long caves. They can be distinguished by dropping a bit of
concentrated HCL on the rock. Limestone fizzes, dolomite won't.
Superimposed on all this is a series of faults resulting fromthe Allegheny
Orogeny (mountain building). This compression from the southeast occured
the last time Africa plowed into North America. The force was sufficient
to raise mountains and break frock formations along thrust faults. One of
these faults, the Saltville Fault, can be seen at the entrance to New River
Cave. New River Cave is built along this fault, the ceiling being made of
more resistant dolomite. As far as caves are concerned faults near the
surface are relatively benign, being inactive. This dosen't mean that Giles
dosent get shaken once in a while.
