The quake was felt over 300,000 square miles, ranging from TAG
to Pennslyvania. Houses were shaken, chimneys thrown down and people
ran into the streets. There were even rumors, (unfounded for the most
part) of Angels Rest being "rocked". This quake was the biggest in the area
and the second biggest in the southeast. It was follwed for several
months by aftershocks.
The next rumbles were on April 23, 1959, March 8, 1968, and
November 19, 1969. It's interesting to note that the people in 1897
describe the sound of the quake as "a train going by" while from 1959 on
it's "a plane breaking the sound barrier". These quakes were rated as
MMIV-VI and all were centered more or less on Pearisburg. The old story
we all hear is about Tawney's Cave being modified by the '59 quake.
Wheter true or not these quakes are strong enoug to do that type of
damage. According to Virginia Tech geophysicists the fault under Giles
most likely responsible is a 5-25Km deep Pre Cambrian fault formed in an
ocean before the Atlantic existed. It has now been stresssed by
subsequent continent bashing.
While Giles does have a respectable earthquake history these quakes
are not the Jacuzzi busters of California fame. Ours are felt over a much
larger area due to the east coast geology. It is somewhat disconcerting to
realize a cave is a temporary feature which by it's nature wants to fall
down and in Giles County caves what's underneath our feet wants to bring
down what's over our heads.
