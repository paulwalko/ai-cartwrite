A HIKER GOES CAVING
"Three points of contact!" JEEZ-LOU-WEEZ! I thought to myself, if she says that
one more time...
A while back, I finally convinced my spouse to be tht it was high time for me, a
dyed-in-the-wool backpacker who loves the flora, fauna fresh air and wide open
spaces associated with that means of recreation, to personally experience this thing
called spelunking, better known as "caving". After all, I reasoned, if I was going to be
socially involved with these people I may as well experience for myself what all the
hub-bub is about. Never really understood what in the world could be exciting about
crawling around way below the surface of the earth, through mud and slime
encounering only God/Allah knows what, come out tired, thirsty, hungry, dirty and sore,
only to plan to do it again and the sooner the better. So I got Cecile to agree to take
me on one of her trainee trips to find out first-hand.
Our group was small, numbering six: three trainees, Cecile, glen, and me. I
wasn't really a "trainee" per se. I was just along for the ride, you see, for the
aforementioned reasons. we met at Jim Washington's place and set off for Linksz As
we walked through the field, I kept trying to spot the entrance. Never did see it. glen
had to pint it out while I was pretty much standing on it. I was amazed at the size; it
looked like a rabbit's hole at first glance. We slithered in, it was easier than I thought.-
Nothing difficult about sliding down a slope on one's buit. It was pretty neat being
underground and the temperature felt good, too. Remember, said our faithful leader,
three pints of contact is needed to be safe. OK, that's easy to remember. Two feet and
a...KLUNK!... no, she says, your head is NOT considered a point of contact. Several
times she would catch us with only two points connecting...our feet, and we would be
called on it. The safest way is three points! OK, OK, OK! I've got enough to think about
without worrying about how many parts of me are actually touching the darn cave.
How important can it be, the backcountry walker thought. I was soon to find out. While
trying to negotiate a rather steep slope, I decided it was high time to just stand up,
assess the situation, and use some leg muscle. I slipped, of course, adn found myself
at the bottom, sitting with a stalgmite between my legs. Cecile was at the bottom and
glen and the treinees at the top, all were quiet to see if I was alright. Glen, ever the
gentleman and trying not to laugh his head off, was telling me to wipe the smile off my
face and Cecile was telling me that that particular part of my anatomy was not
considered something that could hold onto something else. (Wanna bet, Cecile?) On
well, the trinees got a good laugh out of it too.
We made our way through passages and tunnels, sometimes standing,
sometimes stooping and sometimes crawling along on our bellies. At one point, after
executing the latter positon for a while (this position being my favorite actually- lots of
points of contact!) we found ourselves in a small room where we could stand. A difficult
climb is there and if you are physically able to treach the top, they say, there is
