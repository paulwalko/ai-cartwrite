Llal Virginia Tech seismic network. Stations are identified by closed circles and a three-
or four-character code. Dashed line shows division of Plateau and Valley and Ridge provinces.
Giles County is shown by the shaded area. (b) Epicenter (closed circles with event numbers and
68 percent confidence-cllipsoid axes) map for microearthquakes located by data from the Giles
County subnetwork. JHD relocated epicenters 171 are shown by open circles with event letter
designators and 90 percent confidence-ellipsoid axes. Yetwork seismic stations are shown by
open triangles with three-letter codes. The locations of vertical profiles A-d' and B-B' are also
indicated. Insel map show's area of this figure (shaded portion) and locations of the Narrows
seismic Nation (NAV. open triangle symbol) and Richmond IR).
Accounts of earthquakes have been reported in Giles since the.
earliest settlers arrived. Shocks that can be felt are seldom, but when
they happen they are that much more noticeable. From the reports of Giles
area quakes most people describe them as "someone driving by in a heavy
truck or the furnace blowing up". The big momma of them all happened on
May 31, 1897. This quake, probably centered on Pearisburg, was measured
as a modified Mercalli VIII (a scale of earthquake intensity based on
observed effects. The San Francisco quake of 89 was a IX or X. The
Richter scale is determined mathematically from actual seismograph
traces).
