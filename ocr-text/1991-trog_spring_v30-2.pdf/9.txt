A Whole Lot of Shakin' Goin' On
by
Ed Fortney
Next time you're in some deep, dark and muddy hole in the ground,
somewhere in Giles County, you might want to stop and reflect on the fact
that this area is one of the most seismiclly active in the state.
Fortunately, while California is waiting for the big one, Virginia settles
for a lot of little ones.
Before we start talking about actual earthquakes let's discuss the
local geology. Giles County is situated in the folded and faulted Valley &
Ridge province of the Appalachians. It is boarded on the east by the
volcanic rocks of the Blue Ridge and Piedmont (no caves), and on the west
by the flat lying sedimentary rocks of West Virginia (lots of caves).

The Valley and Ridge province is so named because of the folds and
faults that geographically present themselves as our familiar mountains
and valleys. In an erosional phenomenon known as inversion of topography
the mountains are typically synclines (troughs) and the valleys are
anitclines (arches).
