Fern!
It is true that the whole thing was a group screw up caused by not thinking things
through enough and arguing with each other enough. This is my side of the story. On
my first day at TAG I was excited and nervous. I tried really hard to be safe and not
make any mistakes. I felt like it was inevitable that I, a voting trainee, did miss
something no matter how many times I tried to check myself out, I made an error of
some sort during each one of the pits we did during that first day. The mistakes.
made, however, were all minor and inconsequential to the issue of saftey.
My second day went well and I was getting into bopping these outdoor pits. We
decided to do Fern on the third day. I don't think any of us had switched our mindsets
from the vacation we were all on, to the serious cave that lay before us. We got a late
start that morning. I was eager to see what hiking up a steep hill with a fully loaded
(650' rope & other supplies) internal frame pack would be like. I found myself over
eager to set a quick pace up the hill and was taking brakes so as not to lose the rest of
our group. This was a hurried feeling that we all shared.
At the entrance, I gladly gave Bryce the pack to deal with in the cave. I dressed
for a cave but not for a really cold wet trip. After bopping pits in shorts and a tee shirt
this seemed like a lot. I had no part in the rigging. When I got to the rigging it looked
good to me. Cecile mentioned that she didn't think this was where they had rigged two
years ago. After thinking about Ko's description and the rope grooves in the stone we
went with it because it looked like an obvious place to rig. Sandy was the first to go
down; she had her ascending gear on.
i was going to check out the art gallery Cecile had mentioned but didn't when
confused signals came up from Sandy. We started to worry about what might be going
wrong but instead of making it a good long discussion we decided to send down the
most ready person. That happened to be me. Cecile would have been the second
person down before any of the confused signals came up. I told Dave that one whistle
meant nothing; two meant send someone down and three meant send no one down
and call in a rescue. He agreed to repeat my calls to confirm they had been heard.
This sounded like it was clear and simple. Cecile took a picture of one very nervous
caver, as I started to rappel. After about 15 feet I couldn't see anything but a few feet of
rope. After slowly and cautiously descending about 300' of rope I realized that the
rope was going into the waterfall. About when I realized this I was already being hit
with spray and wind. The (virgin) rope became very slick. I tried to call to Sandy but
there was no response. Since I could not establish any communication I went into the
waterfall. A second later I was having trouble breathing slowly and was
hyperventilating. I was worried about going too fast and hitting the bottom as Sandy
might have done. When I felt rock below my feet I was shaking so badly that I could
barely get my rack off the rope.
Sandy and I decided that neither of us would be able to climb through the
waterfall and that assistance would be needed. We gave the three signals and started
to prepare for hours of waiting. Dave was down a few minutes later. He had brought
more supplies which were ample for a 20 hour wait. We talked a lot and with a the
high morale among us the time flew by. We all were able to climb out on the rescuer's
rope and get out by dawn.
