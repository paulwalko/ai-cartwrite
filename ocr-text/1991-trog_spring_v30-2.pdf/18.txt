entrance, pushed my head into the hole and peered into darkness. It looked
vertical. I tossed a rock into the chasm and briefly hear it hit the ground.
Damn!
Lesley and Hoss was soon on the scene, and Lesley and I entered the
cave. From the small, but seeming stable entrance room there was one
narrow passage leading downward on the left which I pierced.
Remembering the rock that crushed my pack, I moved slowly. The tight
climbdown ended in a muddy stream room which was big enough for me to
stand up in. From here I could see the stream snaked between two rock
faces off to the right. Lesley decided to wait to travel further because she
didn't want to disturb the stream which may have supplied drinking water.
After thanking the landowner, we drove away that day with
experience exploring virgin caves. The entrances we discovered may lead
somewhere interesting, but we will never know the secrets of virgin holes
until we dare to go where no man has been.

Cave Winery
From the TARARA Winery brochure: We have built the winery in a
3000 square foot cave to provide a perfect temperature and humidity
controlled environment for barrell aging our premium wines. the cave has
a 7,000 gallon capacity and also houses the winery's laboratory. Our
spacious tasting room adjoins the cave, and there are private reception
and meeting facilities available. (Anybody for a mapping trip or want to
plan a VAR in the area?). TARARA winery is just north of Leesburg near
Lucketts, VA. The address is Tarara winery, Rt. 4 box 229, Leesburg, VA
22075 phone 703-771-7100.
