The President's Column
Well, I guess it would be prudent at this juncture to mention stuff in
the club and other things in the new world order. Elections were held and
there were some changes, if there weren't ! would be sleeping now,
instead of writing this for the trog. The new officers: Mike Horne-Vice
President, Rich Simpson-Treasurer, Maurya Fisher-Secretary, and some
guy named Dave as President.
To recap the semester- Banquet was a blast in Owens, 25th
anniversary celebration, good food and we even made money. Picnic-cool
deal. Though Saturday morning ther wee a few people who wnated to
moved the party to town and indoors, but yea the gods were pleased and
the sun did shine upon the cavers by 5pm that day.
People caved, except in Clover Hollow which is closed as you read this
very word. It is late, I am confused and there is yet another article to
write.
Dave Colatosti
President
Rappels w/out climbing
ps. Oh yea did I mention the fact that some people got sort of trapped in a
cave called Fern and some got stuck in Giant Caverns
Letter from the Editor
Good evening, and what can I tell you? Well, here it is. It's a big one.
Lots of new and interesting features for the Trog. Science, humor, and a
crossword puzzle. Thanks to Kay for her work on previous Trogs, and good
luck to Scott Rapier as the new Editor (unless there is unanimous call for
an editor-in-absentia). Relax, don't worry, have a homebrew!
