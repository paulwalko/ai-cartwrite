Exploring Virgin Caves
On Saturday, 2-1-91, Lesley Colby, Hoss Leiffer, and I traveled about
an hour from blacksburg to investgate a "hole" in someone's back yard. All
of us were excited to find out exactly what the hole looked like, and if it
was a cave to explore it's virginity. .
The landowner took us to a woody section of her land at the edge of a
field. There, stood a 20 by 20 foot sinkhole containing fallen trees, dead
leaves, construction debris and a small hole between two mossy rocks.
Peering inside, we realized that the cave entrance dropped at a steep slope
and that we should rappel in to penetrate.
Hoss entered the tight leaf-filled entrance first. Next, I rappeled
down the 15 foot entrance and filled my shirt with leaves and dirt. When
Lesley was in the entrance room, we checked several dead end side
passages. We then dispersed forward through a downward-sloping passage
lined with seveal formations. After about 35 feet the passage narrowed
and apparently continued past a point where a football sized rock was
wedged between the ceiling and the muddy floor. Hoss grabbed the rock,
set it to his side and stated scooping sexual chocolate out of the passage
with an old pan he found.
The mud-choked passage, throuhg which Hoss and I could not fit, slid
downward to a muddy foot wide stream. Lesley became useful at this time
for digging. Hoss and. I lowered her upside down by the feet into the tight
passage. She widened the hole slowly, bringing up rocks and mud, but after
five or six hauls, she got a headrush and our episode stopped. We dicided
to come back to this part of the cave later, when better tools were
available.
We returned to the entrance cavern. I set my pack down and crawled
down a small passage while Hoss and Lesley investigated the upper half of
the room. "Rock!" Hoss yelled. The massive rumble of a sliding boulder in
the main room made my heart leap. There was a silence, then everyone
called out that they were ok. a seemingly stable piece of ledge had given
way under under Hoss's weight. I backed slowly out of my position into the
entrance room to see Hoss hoisting a massive slab of rock off my pack.
Inspecting my supplies, there appeared to be no damage, but Lesley
suggested that I thoroughly test the vertical gear at the bridge before
relying on it.
Finding no further leads, we climbed out of the cave and investigated
another sinkhole in the nearby area. Lesley and Hoss enterd a small cave
passage and started moving rocks while I wandered in the woods to look
for other entrances. I found a series of five sinkholes, none of which had
entrances large enough for me tofint through. "With all of these sinkholes,
there has to be an entrance somewhere near!" | thought. In excitement, 1
circled back toward the others only to discover a modest limestone
