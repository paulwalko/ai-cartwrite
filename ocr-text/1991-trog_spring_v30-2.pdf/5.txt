Incident in Fern Cave in Alabama on March 11, 1991
On March 11, 1991 Bryce Bolton, Dave Colatosti, Mike Horne, Cecile James, Sandy
Knapp, Mac McElroy, and John Williams, a group of trained and vertically competent cavers,
decided to go to Suprize pit in Fern. The group had been pit bouncing on previous days and felt
prepared to do something bigger that day. It had not rained for at least 5 days but the ground was
still wet and water levels were still high. After talking to a cayer who had done the cave before they
recieved information about the rigging. They also were told that it would be somewhat misty and it
might be difficult to understand rope commands in the pit. In preparation they acquired some
whistles to aid in pit communications. The group had gotten a late start and the pace was quick on
the hike up to the cave. Dave had recieved the information about the rigging and was leading
After following the stream they came to a point where the stream dropped off into the pit. The
group also spotted a good natural backoff for rigging. Dave, Mike and Sandy went off to do the
rigging. After crawling out on the ledge they came to three man made anchors: two large eye bolts
and a piton. This seemed to be the right place although some of the information did not quite fit.
Dave had been told that he might need one or two Stubai carabiners to rig the off the oversized
bolts, but this was not so. The rigging.crew also noted that the anchors, while quite stable, were
somewhat rusty. However there were 1/4" to 1/2" grooves in the rock from rope wear, so this
seemed to be the right place. After rigging a self equalizing anchor on the three anchor points and
backing it off down the passage to the natural point and padding, the group was ready to go down.
The plan was to send four down, then two up and two down until all had bounced the pit and one
person did it twice. The first group came out on the ledge using the saftey line. Cecile who had
done the pit before, said she didn't remember the rigging looking like this. She also noted there had
been more room in the waiting area and recalled waiting further on ahead. After pointing out the
tricky ledge to negotiate if they did go further ahead to wait, the deep rope grooves in the rock the
group believed that they were in the right place. Dave suggested that either Sandy or Cecile be the
first ones down since they had both done long drops before. Sandy agreed to go down first.
Noting that the waterfall was nearby and may cause communication problems, the whistle
commands were worked out. Once Sandy was down she would either climb back up if the
situation was a no go or blow the whistle twice to signify "off rope, next person down".
Sandy went down with full up gean on in the event of an emergency. As she dropped she
could see the waterfall in the distance, but the haze grew heavier and she didn't know that she was
rappelling into the full force of the waterfall until she was in it. At that point she had no choice but
to continue down where she might be able to get out of the waterfall to rig to climb. After she got
to the bottom and rigged to climb, she was about to start when she realized that she might not be
able to make it up the climb in the water. It appeared that she would have to climb about 80 feet in
the full force of the waterfall before she would be clear. At that point she blew the whistle once,
and weighted the rope so no one would come down. Then she went to Grahms Grotto and took
off her wettest clothes and went back and blew the whistle repeatedly.
When the top heard the repeated whistles, we at first responded with multiple blasts to let her
know we heard. She could not hear our response due to the waterfall. After blowing her whistle
she went back in and took shelter under her trash bag and got out of the water and wind. At the
top, John was ready and it seemed that he would be a good person to send down next. At that
