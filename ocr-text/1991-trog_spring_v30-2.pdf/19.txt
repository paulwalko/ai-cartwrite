The Best Caving Trip I Ever Almost Went On
by Bill Hohenboken
On Saturday, the 20th of May of 1989, the Cave Exploration Group of East Africa
celebrated the 25th anniversary of the group's founding with a Silver Jubilee Dinner. I
was in Kenya that summer on Virginia Tech business and attempted to join them for
the big event.
My introduction to Kenya's subterrainian resources was from "The Underground
Atlas: A Gazetteer of the World's Cave Regions" by John Middleton and Tony
Waltham. The atlas identified two karst regions in the country and drew attention to the
existance of numerous lava tubes, many of them unexplored. It also described the
famous caves of Mount Elgon, on the Kenya/Uganda border, which are frequented by
elephants and other mammals in search of salt and other minerals.
Middleton and Waltham's book also contains a roster of national caving
organizations, of which the Cave Exploration Group of East Africa was one. I wrote Jim
Simons, a founding member of the group and their honrary chairman, fully expecting
no reply. Mr. Simons surprised me, however, with a cordial reply inviting me to join
them for a caving trip during my visit. He also asked that I bring as many 4.5v flat
batteries to him as my luggage would hold. They are hard to come by and expensive
in Kenya.
As luck would have it, my visit coincided with the aforementioned anniversary
bash. What better place to celebrate such an auspicious occasion than in a cave? To
be specific, the party was held in cave #14 on Mount Suswa, not too far from Nairobi in
the Great Rift Valley. To be even more specific, it was in the "ballroom.".
Revellers converged on Mount Suswa in a collection of four-wheel-drive safari
vehicles over less than perfectly maintained Kenyan roads. All the banquet gear, and
it was considerable, had to be roped down into the cave (and later, back out again).
Post-lunch preparations included pitching toilet tents, erecting banquet tables, laying
out a dance floor and sleeping quarters and cooking or warming the feast.
From 6:30 to 8:00, the program called for "prepraundial imbibing,"the colonial
British equivalent to Happy Hour. The banquet followed, featuring among other things,
potage de tomate, curry ya samaki, legumbre picante, oryza fervens, papadams,
sambals and chutney. Libations were generous in variety and quantity.
Singing, dancing to a boombox and generalized debauchery followed, until the
wee small hours of the morning. The party was recorded on video. A highlight had to
be the damsel in the skin-tight tiger-patterned pajamas who danced nonstop for at
least as long as the camera was in operation. For the minority that were up to it, the
evening's last event was a hike through the cave on a loop trail that brought
participants back to the ballroom, not too long before the sun began to rise.
It clearly was the best caving trip that I ever almost attended. Fate, however, or
perhaps it was carelessness, intervened. Thad come into Nairobi on Friday, to meet
some of the cavers for the Saturday morning ride to Mount Suswa. That evening, I saw
a bit of the city and ended up at an excellent Italian restaurant. En route back to my
hotel, I met three burly muggers, for whom I became the muggee. They relieved me of
everything of value on my person and gave me a sound thrashing as well.
Saturday, when I should have been furthering international peace and goodwill
deep in the bowels of Mount Suswa, I was in Nairobi licking my wounds, replacing
stolen eyeglasses, stopping payment on credit cards and feeling sorry for myself.
Such is life.
