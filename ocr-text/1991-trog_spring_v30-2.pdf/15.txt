New Mexico or Bust
This all began simply enough, Sandy told me of this wild idea about caving over Christmas break
with Ko and Joan. It was easy to hook me, I had nothing better to do. Finally Barbara and Beth
were added to finish the cast of characters in this epic saga. A tale of adventure rivaling those of
the Vikings or Conquistadors.
STEP 1: Planning.
Easy enough- we chose the spontaneous approach to our journey. The idea was to deal with
it as it happened.
STEP II: Assembly.
After my arrival at signout on the evening of December 20th, Ko, Barbara and I set out to
do the food shopping. Next we were supposed to have had my 4-Runner packed and ready to go
when Joan and Beth arrived from NOVA at approximately midnite. Well you know how things
go... there were several interruptions...AKA the Simpsons etc. When Joan arrived a full hour
early nothing was ready to go. Finally at 2am with my truck filled beyond reason we departed.
STEP III: Go west young man.
Someone once said getting there id half the fun. He's obviously never been on one of our
little expeditions. Driving Joan's Mazda 323 ko take the lead. He claims to know the shortcut
through C'burg. Well, an hour later somewhere on Mud Pike southwest of C'burg the call comes
over the CB. "Uuuuh, Rich....I think we missed a turn back there..." That's right folks, we got
lost in our own backyard- Montgomery County!!!
We fumbled and stumbled until we found our way onto 1-81. At last something was
happening. Into the night (early morning) we drove until daybreak, somewhere in eastern
(Tennessee. I want to know why the surveyors made that state so damn long. 1-40/1-81
streches a full 500 miles from Bristol to Memphis and it takes forever. Anyway it rained hard
and nasty from Nashville until we crossed the mighty Mississippi River. Then suddenly clear
skies. So we stopped for lunch at the Arkansas welcome Center. Then just as quickly as the oasis
appeared it vanished. We drove back into the rain. Rain's fine, but as the sun left for the dayand
the mercury began to fall, the rain was replaced by ice. I never thought I'd see the day when I
would have to scrape the ice from the inside of my windows. We slip-slidded our way to Ft.
Smith, Arkansas where we called it quits forthe night and drowned our sorrows at the Super-8
Motel (if you know what I mean).
That night's rest turned out to be a good thing for it gave the road crews a chance to scrape
and salt the road. Clear sailing the rest of the way. Next stop, Oklahoma City where we stopped
at my uncles's house for a free lunch and rest break. The chili tasted great. We were reminded
of that every once in a while all the way to Carlsbad. That's right, farts abounded.
We finally reached our destination at 11pm, December 22. That's when we arrived at the
door of Jim and Andrea Goodbar. He had some maps and permints for us to pick up. But mostly
thank them for allowing us to use their camper-trailer that night. After 48 hours we were
there.
STEP IV. I cave therefore I am.
After thanking the Goodbars, we left the next morning for Lincoln National Forest. We set
camp 7400 feet up in the Guadalupe mountains. Joan was amazingly brave with her Mazda
taking on rough gravel roads, steep hills, dry stream beds and various other obstacles. That
afternoon we visited Cottonwood Cave. It was a nice warm up for things to follow. We needed to
adjust to 7400 feet! But still it was a huge cave, large entrance, formations, etc, etc, etc. That
