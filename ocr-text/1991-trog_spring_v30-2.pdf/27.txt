A Day at the Zokaites'
or, the Story of Two Very Naive Cavers
It all started off very innocently. Word had gotten around that Jake and
I were thinking about going to TAG, and wanted a couple of chest rollers. Joe
20, nice guy that he is, mentioned that he had figured out a good way to set
up the Simmons roller on a chest harness. He offered to sell the parts to us
and even help us set them up. Being rather inexperienced with ropewalkers we
jumped at the chance for help.
To make a long story somewhat less long, we went over to the zo's, Carol
cooked a great dinner, and Joe made the roller setups for us. We did
eventually use them in TAG, and they worked great. Anyhow, wanting to return
the favor, we offered to babysit sometime.
BIG MISTAKE!!!
As it turned out, Carol took us up on the offer a few weeks later.
"Great, I think to myself. A chance to get caught up on my homework, and
maybe do a little sewing too. This should be a nice relaxing day.
WRONG!!!
We arrived at the 20's at around eightish the following morning. The
kids were pretending to be good as Carol served breakfast. When she, Joe, and
Jerry Redder left to go caving at Newberry's I was smug, thinking of myself
spending a leisurely day in a warm house instead of some wet crawlway.
Then the kids realized that they were in control. The first order of
business was to go downstars and scatter their Lincoln Logs all over the
basement. When one of the twins finished his log cabin the other decided to
knock it over, promptly causing the builder to cry.
"Rusty, what happened?" I asked, concerned.
"I'm NOT Rusty!" was the hateful reply. I could see I was endearing
myself to these kids. I decided to open up my biology book and do a little
reading.
I was interrupted by screams from upstairs. I entered, to stumble upon a
scene straight out of "Gulliver's Travels". Jake was tied up with some cheap
prusik cord and was getting beat up by three hellians. He beggeed for my
help, but I decided to leave him there until lunchtime. Lunch was a fruitful
event wherein each child decided that he no longer liked the lunchmeat that
Mom had been feeding him for the past several years. However, the next couple
of hours were relatively blissful, as we popped in a tape of Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles. This was the favorite of the kids, who had probably only seen
it about 1,236 times before. But hey, whatever works. The nerve wracking
part came when the kikds decided to do some acrobatics reminiscent of the
movie. I had visions of a broken leg, or worse, a cracked skull. "Uh, Carol,
there's been a slight accident..." Fortunately none of the above happened,
but Bobby did manage to play us some very pleasant melodies on a machine
bearing a striking resemblance to Jim's Annoyatron. Whatever possessed the
zo's to throw their hard earned cash in that direction, I'll never know.
After dinner, we proposed to the kids that they get ready for bed. Danny
announced that Mommy always lets him have a bubble bath before bed.
Skeptical, I promised that if he went to bed now, Mommy would give him two
bubble baths. tomorrow. What the hell, I thought. Let Carol deal with it.
One long bedtime story later, we had them in bed and semi quiet. I looked at
Jake. "Tomorrow should be a nice, relaxing day, Honey". We were going to
Murder Hole. All of a sudden, wet passage was looking pretty good.
