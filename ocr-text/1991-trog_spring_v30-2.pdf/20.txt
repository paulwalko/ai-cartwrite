I can, however, report that the Cave Exploration Group of East Africa is alive and
well, that it is a fun-loving, hard-charging crew that probably would feel right at home
with the Cave Club of VPI. Although it does lose something in the translation, one of
their songs will give you an idea of the seriousness with which they approach life. It is
to be sung to the tune of My Darling ClementinÄ—.
Chorus:
Oh me cavers, oh me cavers
Oh me cavers so sublime,
Out of caverns into taverns,
There to booze till closing time
Verses:
Up we went to Mount Suswa,
Down we went inot the pit,
What did we find when we got there,
Fifty feet of bat shit.
So we ventured to Mount Elgon,
Caving elephants there to see,
So we drew one on the bulletin,
Spele-elephant of CEG.
Into lavas at Kiboko,
Ithundu guano for to mine,
Mathaioi's now for tourists,
But both paid for chairman's time.
Ndarugu, out at Thika,
Crawling there can be a swine,
With your arse stuck out a passage,
Just watch out for porcupine.
Down to Tivia and Pagani,
Limestone labyrynths to explore,
CO2 at the bloody bottom,
But we know ther's routes galore.
At Kibwezi, in the Chyulu,
Leviathan is taking time,
Twelve kilometers of passages,
Not to finish will be a crime.
Twentyfive years of Kenya caving,
CEG had done much to pot,
But tonight in the ballroom,
All we'll do is drink a lot.
Thope I'll be there in the year 2016 to help them celebrate the 50th.
