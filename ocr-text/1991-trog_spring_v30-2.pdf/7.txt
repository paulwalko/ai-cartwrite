before they hit the water. That may have changed some things and some additional problem
solving could have been done.
4) Communications were very poor. Walkie talkies would have changed the situation greatly and
word could have gotten out that only an assist was needed. The group at the top could make no
assumptions about the condition of the people at the bottom. Whistle commands were inadequate
and not well thought out. Information on Sandy's and the group's condition could have been
relayed through whistle calls if the crew had thought about it for a while.
5) Questions on rigging should have not been taken lightly. Any doubts about the location or
rature of the rig shoul have been discussed fully and checked out. The group would have
discovered the proper rig point had this happened. .
6) Much of the group did not prepare well for caving. There was an open air pit mentality going
through the group. This is not to say they had not taken the proper gear, but rather that much of the
group thought it would be like a bop trip and did not prepare for a tough trip. A few cavers wore
only cotton and carried no clothing that would insulate when wet. When going underground, one
shold be prepared to stay there for a while.
Note: This report was not fully completed at the time of publication in this newsletter. I thought it
would be good to have something in the Trog related to this incident. The self analysis may not be
Â· complete as I have not had a chance to go over it with others in the group.
