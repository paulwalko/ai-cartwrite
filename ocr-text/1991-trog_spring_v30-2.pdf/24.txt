Price's Strike Cave
It was one of those lazy Sunday afternoons when we really didn't feel like doing
anything. The weather was nice, we cold have hung around Jim's house, sipped
beer, and continued tojust talk about caves. As you might suspect, when a couple of
hard core explorers (read wimps) are sitting around what they've done and what they
are going to do, it's not long before egos are inflated and the realization comes that
word may get out about them wasting the day. After all, old men from Tidewater were
surely surveying virgin passage at the very moment.
So it was the Jack Kehoe and I headed out to Wilburn (Oh No) valley to find one
of those things. As you know we've been systematically walking every inch of
limestone in the Wilburn-Sugar Run area. I still hadn't thoroughly checked Barry
Price's farm which contains the well known Starnes Cavern.
Now like I said we weren't feeling very energetic. After knocking on Mr. Price's
door and exchanging the usual greeting I jokingly asked, "So, you got any more
caves?". Mr. Price rubbed his chin for a moment, "Now that you mention it, right over
there about 500 feet past Starnes' is a big sinkhole. I believe you'll find one down in
there." Jack's and my mounts dropped open. Could this be?
Sure enough, standing on the upside of a 30' deep sink we watched a small
stream flowing into a black hole three feet in diameter at the bottom. To further ensure
that we would find a real cave we had brought only one mini mag light between us.
So, off we went crawling past enormus black fuzzy spiders, spilling pocket change and
getting our street clothes dirty. We belly crawled and squeezed through tortuous
canyon arriving at the first room in the cave. Further progress would require belly
crawling in the stream. Noting significant airflow and insufficient lighting we headed
out.
This cave finding business is hard work. Keep in mind that in the past 50 years
342,501 people have visited Starnes'. Many of them more than once. had any one of
them walked just a little further they would have practically fallen into a totally virgin
cave.
Unfortunately the survey wasn't nearly as easy. It was horror, horror, adn more
horror, wet, muddy and disgusting. This was, after all, wilburn Valley. The cave is
formed along the strike, is very fractured and contains a lot of breakdown. We mapped
the cave in 5 short trips. The "Reminder Crawl" is a crawl about 10 inches high at the
passable path and unuably wider. While lying in a cold stream feeling like a sponge,
Ko remarked "This reminds me of real caving".
Though the cave was quite unenjoyable it held the possiblity of connecting with
Starnes'. The air goes through, however, all leads end with loose, fractured,
dangerous breakdown that one would have to dig through the stream sumps and
reappears in Starnes' about 150 feet away at a place called Avalanche alley. Though
connection appears unlikely, another path from the Starnes' side should be attempted.
The finished map recieved a Merit Award at the 1990 NSS Convention. I would
like to thank Barry Price for graciously allowing us to explore caves on his property.
