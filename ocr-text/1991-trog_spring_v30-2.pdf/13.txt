The Impossible Adventures of Juan Pirate
When we last left Juan Pirate, he was in dire straits. In fact, the situation looked as if
there was no escape. It seems that Juan was stuck at the bottom of a 800 Ft. drop with no way
out! The rope used to rig the drop had not one, but two trainees on it, and they were both in
serious need of assistance.
"Hmmm," Juan thought to himself, "the situation looks drastic. Those trainees have been
on rope close to ten or eleven minutes now and they still are not up! Looks like there is only one
thing to do. I must free climb out of this pit and help those trainees. Everyone says that it is
impossible, but it must be done!"
So Juan set to his impossible task. First, he stripped down to just a pair of shorts. "This.
will keep me from over heating in the pit while I climb, allow free movement of my buttocks,
and prevent me from pulling my groin again," he decided. "And no shoes, while cutting up my
feet, will provide better purchase." Next, he put a large knife between his teeth, just in case he
needed it. Then he instantly began his ascent.
"Damn!" he mumbled around the knife. "If only I had not brought these trainees. I knew
they would not be able to keep up with me! Now they are stuck on rope and I can hear them
wimpering all the way down here."
All of a sudden, with impossible swiftness and fury, a tremendous cascade of frigid snow
melt pelted Juan in the face and ran down his manly bare chest. However, knowing that the
trainees were watching his every move, and realizing that he must be impressing the hell out of
them, Juan clung to the icy, slick limestone.
"When I get up there, I have got to remember to rescue the trainees," he said to no one in
particular. "As fun as this climb may be, there are lives at stake."
Because of his sheer speed and incredible climbing prowess, he quickly drew level with
the first trainee, about 100 feet from the top. Looking at her closely he seemed to recall that
her name began with an S. Susan, he thought. Yes, now he remembered her. She had been very
impressed with him at the meeting and the party. But she was a lively one, with plenty of self
control. She had to have tons of self discipline, the way she resisted his charm. No matter, he
was too busy talking to Dan, gaining his trust and respect, to bother with her. In fact, he might
not even have noticed her if she hadn't come to the party and meeting with Dan. Come to think of
it, weren't they going out or something? That would explain why Dan had been too busy for Juan
lately.
Anyway, on closer inspection, she was not stuck, merely climbing slowly. And peering up
the rope, Juan noticed that the other trainee, was it Billy?, was also just climbing slowly. God,
they climbed so slowly. Juan would have been out of this pit in no time flat on rope. So he
passed them and proceeded to the top of the pit. Scrambling over the lip, he met the astonished
gaze of the rest of the party. "God, Pirate free climbed out of the pit. Jesus, I would have
thought that impossible had I not seen it with my own eyes!" they all said. "Juan, you are
certainly the best caver to have joined this club in years, maybe even since it was formed! This
is simply amazing for someone who was a trainee himself just last fall. Where do you plan to go
from here? Club President? Club Vice-President? On, please do tell."
"Well," exclaimed Juan. "I am sorry, but I just could not be Vice President. You see, I
would run through a cave, and the trainees would just slow me up. Gosh, I might even forget
about them, they would be so far behind. Besides, I am unfulfilled here at VPI. Soon I will be
leaving you to seek my fortune out West. Maybe there I can find what I need to make my life
complete."
And with that, he strode out of the cave and into caver folklore forever. Today, you can
still hear the tales and adventures of Juan Pirate being passed on from caver to caver over
dinner in Dietrick. Wile nobody knows what really happened to him after that day, his legend
lives on.
