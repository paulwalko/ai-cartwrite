something hidden there that is beautiful to see. We all tried to get up there and all I can
say is that since suction cups are not a part of my integumentary system, there was no
way i.could get up there to view the said marvelous sight. Only one of our group
managed actually (the now famous Mark Eisenbies) and he wasn't saying what he
saw. Keeping this mystic place a secretfrom those who are not able to get to it is, I was
told later, a caving tradition, of which there are many.
That behind us, we started out, via another route, and learned how to chimney
and grasp on to holds that weren't there. I wondered aloud as to what would happen if
one of us should slip and fall and maybe get wedged below, or break something, or ·
just go SPLAT down there in the depths. Don't worry, the proficient ones assured us,
we would justgo out and get a RESCUE going for you! did I hear a lilt in their voices at
the prospect? I guess I really started to worry when I observed "Mr. Safety" Davis
making some singular leaps and bounds over these chasms that looked to me like they
would guide you to the proverbial center of the earth.
Along the way, we were introduced to sleeping bats (don't touch), some rather
large arachnids and beautiful formations. I wondered how our leaders remembered
the way out...all the passages look the same to me and there are no blazes down
there!
Once out, we were standing around the entrance/exit, quickly removing gear
against the heat. I removed my helmet and tucked it under my arm. While rubbing
sweat and mud off my face, my mind wandered as I wondered where the beer was
kept. Suddenly the acrid smell of smoke was all around and I looked to see I had
forgotten to extinguish my lamp and had managed to set the jacket on fire. It was
batted out without incident, but I was dismayed to see the hole left there. Oh well,
another caving memory, I thought. (It was Glen's jacket anyway!)
All in all, it wasn't a bad trip and to be fair, there was a bounty of beauty that one
can only view way down there where the sun doesn't shine. Mother Nature has quite a
cache of items on display for those who want to go and behold. Well, that is the end of
this yarn. (I told you it wasn't educational!) Have I been caving since? No. Why not?
To be honest, I really prefer the fauna, flora, wide open spaces and fresh air, dirt and
sweat associated with backpacking. That is not to say that one is better than the
· other...they are just different.
So... Happy Caving...and maybe we'll meet on the trail sometime...
