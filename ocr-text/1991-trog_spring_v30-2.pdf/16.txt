night was the worst of the trip. Cold temperatures and high winds make for more than frozen
water jugs in the morning
Christmas Eve: we had two caves planned for that day. Afterhiking 1.5 hours we arrived
at Black Cave only to discover that the key wouldn't open the locked gate. After a few choice
words we hiked another hour to Hidden Cave. The name is well earned since the cave is at the
bottom of a 60 foot narrow crevasse. Large passages and rooms, and all of ithighly decorated. A
day of sensory excitation, but just the beginning.
Christmas Day: the best day of the whole trip. After an early start we collapsed camp to
leave that night. After a paroramic drive down the rim road we departed for Deep Cave. In
fromnt of me was 2-3 miles of 'high clearance' road. It seemed forever to get there. 2 hours of
western-styled boulder hopping white nkuckle driving was well worth it. From here we hiked
another 2 hours to the cave. The payoff was immensely rewarding. The remoteness of the
location explains the nearly perfectly undisturbed condition of the cave. The entrance was
confusing to negotiate and we all weren't at the bottom until 5pm. Put simply, this cave is a two
stage 500 foot sloping entrance which requires tow ropes to navigate. At the bottom lies a room
of monstrous proportions filled with every imaginable variety of undisturbed formations and
decorations. Sensory overload only begins to describe the feelings I'm sure we all felt. This was
the pinnacle of the whole trip. We didn't get back to our camp until 3am. From there it took till
5am to leave the mountain. WHAT A DAY!!!
December 26: After that we all needed a day off. I woke up in my truck to find some bird
pecking the window, scratching the roof and playing with the antenna all in an attempt to drive
me off. Rather annoying but unsuccessful. Park Ranch Caves is a collection of about 15 gypsum
tubes. The perfect place for an afternoon of playing around. That night we chose to spend in the
local youth hostel. We all wanted a night in a bed and a hot shower. But of course the water
heater was only good for one or two uses. TRUST ME!!
December 27: Endless Cave and Mckitrick Cave were different but still quite fun. These
were more like Virginia caves, crawling and stooping through mazes of passages. But still there
were plenty of pretties to look at. That night we dined at Lucy's Mexican restaurant. Great food
and drink at reasonable prices, there's nothing wrong with that.
December 28: Carlsbad Caverns. We were there, it was there, need I say more. Yes, it's
a commercial cave, but well worth the $4. Besides, ther's nothing wrong with being tourons.
STEP V: Homeward bound.
After trekking through Carlsbad for 4 hours we had toleave. It was a far more pleasant
trip home. First stop, Amarillo, Texas. We at a true Texas dinner at The Big Texan Steak Ranch.
I'm pround to announce that everyone tried and apparently like the RATTLESNAKE. They also
offer a free 72 oz. steak dinner provided you eat it all in an hour. Next stop, Nashville, That's
where Ko and Joan left to do the family thing. Beth came over to my truck for the remainder of
the trip. All she could comment on for the first hour was how much more leg room I had.
Finally, we made it back tosignout. We arrived there about midnite on the 29th.
STEP VI: Conclusion.
Since we were the first real VPI trip to New Mexico that make us the guinea pigs. So
here's some fact that will be of interest. 3646 miles accumulated on my truck. Camping was
simple and free, plenty of public access land. The caves were dry, dusty and warm. Deep Cave is
highly recommended along with Hidden Cave. Always take more rope than suggested. It's not only
a safe practice, it's the only way to get down. The trails to the caves are sporadically marked
but not too difficult to follow. Finally, I personally spent $150. That include everything for
the 10 days of adventure from food and gas to souvenirs and unexpected expenses. Overall, New
Mexico is a fine alternative to venturing south of the border.
