point in time the top had no idea of Sandy's status. The top wasn't sure what exactly the situation
was, and at that point we didn't suspect any major problems and thought it was a simple
communication problem. So John went down in his full vertical rig. His instructions were that if
there were no signal from the bottom they were coming up, two blasts meant everything was ok
and the next person should come down and three blasts meant go get help. As John descended he
could see the waterfall. Further down he could see the water bouncing off a ledge and engulfing
the rope. John stopped and tried to yell down to Sandy but she could not hear him through the
waterfall. John then continued downward to see if Sandy was alright. When he got down he
found Sandy cold and shivering in her bag, he was also cold and shivering. Sandy was caving
electric and had no heat sources on her, so the two huddled in their bags and passed John's lamp.
After John warmed up a little he went out and blew the whistle three times. When the top heard
the whistles there was a problem. Dave said he would go down to verify the help call and possibly
administer first aid since he was an EMT and Sandy's condition was unknown. Dave got all the
extra food and plastic bags from the group and a wool cap and neck gator. It was planned that if no
whistles were heard the three at the bottom would be climbing back up. However, if Dave
whistled three times that meant go call a rescue. Cecile and Bryce were going to call for help while
Mac and Mike would wait at the top of the drop until help arrived. Dave put on his ascending gear
and a trashbag in case of water. Dave descended also noting the water engulfing the rope. Since he
had not heard about the waterfall in the rappell he figured he might be close to the bottom. When
he finally reached the bottom he called out and found John and Sandy shivering badly. He gave
them his carbide lamp and told them the scoop. The three discussed the possiblity of someone
climbing up to get word that they were ok but could not climb out. Dave went to see if the rope
could be pulled out of the waterfall. The spray was so great that he could not see and he hurried
back to the sheltered area before getting too wet. They dicsussed their options again and decided
that the safest option was to call for help. Daye then whistled three times from the bottom of the
drop and the three made preparations for a long wait. When the top heard the three whistles Cecile
and Bryce dumped all their extra gear with Mike and Mac. They headed out and a half an hour
later they reached a phone. Since they had no numbers of local cavers they called 911. About 7
hours after Dave made the whistle for help, a caver in a wetsuit came upon Sandy, Dave and John.
Although chilled, the three were in good spirits and were able to climb out on their own on a rope
rigged in the right place. The three were out of the cave by dawn.
Self Analysis:
1) The group was not well informed. There was too much reliance on Cecile, who had been
to the cave before, and on Dave, who recieved brief instructions on rigging. The whole situation
could have been avoided if the group had read the guidebook.
2) Since the group was rushed, the were not thinking enough. There should have been more
discussion when Cecile was unsure of the rig and the place where she recalled waiting should have
been.
Also when the crisis occured, the group should have stopped and problem solved a little
more. John was sent down the rope in unprepared fashion. He should have been given more food
and plastic bags. He should also have worn one down the drop.
3) On the rappel Sandy should have been more attentive and watched out for the falls. A
changeover could have avoided this rescue situation. Dave and John should have done a changover
