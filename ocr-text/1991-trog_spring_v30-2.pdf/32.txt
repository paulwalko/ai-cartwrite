Sadie's rescue
Here's Sadie, the 3-year-old coon dog that was trapped on a Giles County Cliff, at the
moment of her rescue over the weekend by Brian Cruikshank. Cruikshank is a member of
the Virginia Tech Caving Club. Sadie had been trapped on a ledge 200 feet high for eight
days. The dog's owner, Billy Joe Farley, thought Sadie was lost on a raccoon hunt Dec. 7,
but a few days later he heard her howl. It took three days for rescuers to reach her.
