The Pythagorean Pinch
Fear is not a bad thing. It can alert you to danger or your own limitations. Without it, I probably would
have carelessly injured myself many times.
One day near the end of the fall semester, Dave Colatosti invited me to help him with a dig on their
project cave, Crabtree's Groundhog Hole. Dave, Mike Horne, Todd Henderson and myself attempteed to
clear mud out of the passage. We were hopeful that it would open up to larger passage because it was
sucking lots of air. On a previous trip John Morada had gotten about five feet into it. We managed todig as
far back as twenty-four feet during this trip. Up to this point in the trip I had not gotten a chance to work on
it. I had been trying (with no success) to reclaim an Autolite that the Cave Gods had snatched from Mike.
When I first looked at the long crawlway it was a little intimidating. Thave a little fear of squeezing
through a short pinch. A short tight spot is not too difficult to get helped out of if I get stuck. This was a
long 30-60-90 triangle; hypotenuse pressing against my back and too thin at the 30 degree corner to
comfortably put anything but my hand in. Dave told me that it was possible to get to the end with my
helmet on. Thad never gone through a long crawl where I could not turn my head for twenty feet. I was
pretty nervous when I realized the length of the crawi.
I started like I usually do by not paying much attention to the information my eyes gave me but rather
by feeling my way through. I put my right arm ahead and pushed with my toes. The cave had already
loaded me down with mud, causing my clothes to stick to the sides of the passage. Five feet in and I had
come to the first pinch. The thought of having to feel my way through this point in reverse was unnerving.
I took a breath and paused. Then after shutting out a few unwanted thoughts, I pushed on. The second
squeeze didn't bother me as much as the first one. After pausing, taking a deep breath and shutting out
more nasty thoughts I made it to the end. There was a slightly larger space here where I could move
around. We referred to it as a room, which sounded more comforting to me even though I could not turn
around. This is where the real pinch was. The only way past this point was through a space in some rock
fall. The rushing air nearly blew out my carbide lamp. I tried toreassure myself that all of the rocks around
and above me were completely stable. I really didn't believe myself though. After calming myself down
again, I dug enough dirt to fill an empty pack that lay next to me. After filling the pack with mud I noticed that
my light was about to go out. I knew I couldn't light it with my muddy hands. This made me anxious about
waiting in the dark, in a place that I wasn't comfortable with yet. I tried to rationalize with myself. I told myself
that I couldn't see where I was going on the way out anyway, so it shouldn't matter if I had no light.
Mike was outside of the crawl, reaky to pull the webbing that was tied to the pack of mud. I worried
that the pack getting caught in a pinch. Having something blocking my exit, even for a short time, made me
nervous. I wanted to know I could get out when I wanted.
Twaited in the dark while the pack was pulled through. Once it was free I didn't hesitate a second.
Rapidly squirming in reverse my clothes were pulled up and my stomach slide against the cold, abrasive
mud. Ramming myself through the tight spots I was relieved to be out. The crawl seemed very short on
the way out. I made it out in about a fifth of the time it took to go in. .
I wasn't bothered by this crawl after this because it contiued to enlarge each time we went back to
dig more. I called the crawl "Remedial Geometry" because it looked like a right triangle and we had all
crawled it may times that day. Mike named the pinch at the end the Pythagorean Pinch because after
passing Remedial Geometry we could not get through the puzzle at the end.
