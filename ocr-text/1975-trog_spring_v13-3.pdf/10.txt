What We've Done
on Sinking Creek
In brief, we've been tracing a lot of water a long ways, but not finding
much in the way of a new cave. Sinking Creek itself has been traced to a rather
large spring on the New River, about three miles from where it sinks in dry wea-
ther. The creek sinks in no large holes thanks to an attempt in the thirties by
the WPA to plug these openings. However, we did pull a small log out of one hole
and then watched as a beer bottle floated down the stream, made a right angle
turn, and was sucked into the hole. At the other end, the water reappears at a
150 foot long spring downstream from Eggleston. Right now I don't know whether
a cave was at one time enterable from the spring, but present rubble from the
railroad tracks makes entrance impossible,. Whatever it is that we can't get
into has got to be huge. All of Sinking Creek geta su:ked up for about six
months out of the year and there is evidence that more water than just that from
sinking Creek is flowing down there. Two seperate dye traced from the sinking
stream near William's Gulf Station on the mountain Lake Road, made in high flow
conditions, have reappeared over five miles away at both the resurgence soring
for Sinking Creek and at a major spring a mile further downstream. This suggests
some kind of overflow route between the system feeding the two springs.
Farther upstream, the main stream in Clover Hollow Jave has been traceci four
miles to the southwest where it reappears in both Tawney's and Smokehole Caves.
When we found this out, we rushed into Smokehole to see if we could find the
place where the stream splits. Sure enough, we foun≈Ø a place where half of the
stream disappears into a low narrow crevice. Two dye traces from within Smoke-
hole verified that water disappearing into this slot reappeared as the main
stream in Tawney's. A small #tream at the wastorn end of the vidi ito! in Smoke-
hole was also traced to the lawney's stream,
Dye was also used to verify that water flows under the bend in which Link's
Cave is located, probably much as Link's Cave used to carry water through the
bend,
What remains to be done in the area is the survey of Smokehole. The old
map was done in the forties and there is no indication I can find of what qua-
lity survey it was. Since then, the '"impenetrable" breakdown upstream has been
penetrated by way of a belly-crawl in the rapids and the main stream can be fol-
lowed for several hundred feet to a place where the ceiling drops to within ten
inches of the floor, still with the main stream present. This is definitely
not pushable, une obscure side lead in the area goes some distance to a large
room with a deep lake. This appears to be the farthest Location from the en-
trance. None of this new stuff is mapped and Bob Page, who has remapped some
of the old section, estimates that the cave has at least double the 2000 feet
shown on the old map.
