Big Ed
To The Tune Of "Big John"
1125
Every night at the party you could see him arrive,
He stood six foot-two, weighed one ninety-five,
Broad at the shoulders, but broader at the hip,
And everyone knew you could always sip
with Bica.

Nobody seemed to know when Ed went home,
Tie always partied late and passed out all alone,
He didn't puke much; rarely even tried,
But when he saw a keg he'd try to drink į t dry
Bigud.
He came from the north, looking kind of lean,
Where he got in a fight over a can of beans,
And a crashine blow from a huge right hand
Sent a V.C. Caver to the Promised Land
Big Ed.
Then came the day at the V.A.R.,
When the keys from Richmond didn't go far,
And cavers were praying and hearts beat fast,
And everyone thought that they'd drunk their last
"Cept ul.
Through the dust and the smoke of that partying sell,
Walked a drunk of a man that the cavers knew well.,
Grabbed a cooler-chest and stood there alone,
And from a six-pack pulled a beer of his own
Bis ed.
And as he stood there, the pride of our club,
A caver called out, Theres a beer in his love,
And twenty men scrambled over to his side,
Swore iig ddie---We'll drink 'till we die!
Big Ed.
With mugs and vessels they started to drink down,
Then came a rumbling by the key on the ground,
And smoke and gas belched out of Ed's ass,
The fateful knew it was over at last
for się ud.
Well they never revived that worthles: sot,
But they pluced a marble key on the spot,
And these few words are written on that stand:
At the bottom of this key lieg a deac, drunk man...Diy Ed.
