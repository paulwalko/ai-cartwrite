Hauling
PART 2
The Davison System by itself (with the audition of one rope) provides all
the materials necessary to construct a pulley system with an ideal mechanical ac-
vantage of 4 to 1. With the addition of just one carabiner and 2 pulleys, an ac-
tual mechanical advantage closer to 4 can be achieved. If only a short piece of
rope, such as the excess at the end which is tied off, is available, a maximum
effort 2 to 1 can be constructed with the System and used until sufficient slack
has been recovered to allow a pulley arrangement of greater advantage to be con-
structed. In all cases, the use of the Davison system components allows the
available physical energy to be used when hauling, and at a high rate of return,
une use of the knee assembly, as a stop cam, was mentioned earlier, Outill
three cam components (shoulder strap, foot rig, anu knee assembly) are adaptable
to a variety of hauling uses, In most situations, the knee can assembly will be
used as the stop cam. The knee assembly (see Nylon sighwave 2) consists essen-
tially of a Gibbs Ascender with a fout loop of 1" tubular nylon webbing attached
to the cam jaw eye with several feet of " shock cord attached to the cam shell,
During a hauling session in which the pull is not directly towards the fixed
point, the flexibility of the shock cord cam tie will allow the cam to automat-
ically position itself, without putting a bend iri the rope, into the most urop-
ward position possible, as in figure 10. As tension in the hauling line is re-
leased, the stop cam will swing in an arc, as the load upon it increases, to
finally lie in direct line between the fixed point and the point where the rope
crosses the lip of the drop, as shown in figure 11, under maximum load. The top
cam, thus arranged, requires no attention but is always positive in its release
and locking modes insuring maximum recovery from each hauling session.
