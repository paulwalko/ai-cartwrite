The friction Fr, and fra, of each block is:
ir, = U x L x P2
and
'r2 = U x 12 x P2
respectively. Substituting equation 6 into equations 7 and 8 yields:
Frı = 0 x 1 = fra
The total friction of the B&T system, I'ra, is
Frrr - Fri + Fr2

The AE of a one block B&T system (IE = 2, only) in contrast is:
E = 7/10 + 0 = 0.5t

since in this case L2, P2, and Fr2 are all zero.
AE calculations for the 2 to 1 piggy back (20) series of pulley arrangements
involves a power series because each pulley which is added to the system comes
under the load experienced by the previous pulley. For example, in ticure 3
the load on pulley Cis of that on pulley which carries of the load exper-
ienced by pulley it. Thus for picty back systems:
