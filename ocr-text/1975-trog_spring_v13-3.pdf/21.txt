The shoulder strap and foot rig are, in essence, each a piece of 2" non-
tubular nylon webbing to which a cam jaw has been solidly attached (in a specific
manner to encourage shear as opposed to straight tension on the stitching) by
means of tubular nylon webbing passed through the jaw eye and sewn to the 2"
webbing. Both the shoulder strap and foot rig have a buckle sewn at one end of
the 2" webbing. A loop in the webbing is thus easily produced and either com-
ponent can be used in this manner to haul. The foot ris would generally be used
as the main line cam with the shoulder strap serving as the hauling cam, Ahaul-
ing cam is used by an individual to create a positive grip on the hauline line
when raising a load. After the cam on the shoulder strap is attached to the
hauling line, a rather long loop is buckled into the 2" webbing. By passing the
hand through the loop and grabbing the sides of the loop with the same hand, the
caver has created a configuration in which the majority of the force of haulina
is taken on the back of the wrist and hand, thus preserving the caver's yrip,
A strong grip is essential for handling anything is it comes over the lip (or
hangs thereupon), even if no further caving is uvrhe, The 2" webbing distributes
the load over a large surface area thus enabling the full force generated by all
parts of the body working in unison to be applied to the haul, often the second
hand will grip the hand in the loop. In this manner the force from both arms may
be used, in addition to that generated by the back and legs.
If one Davison System is the only available quipment at a hauling site, you
still have 2 harness rings (used together) and one sonatti carabiner to use as
pulleys in a 4 to 1 pulley system. The use of more equipment such as pulleys and
carabiners is obviously desirable but these are not always available,
NOW, suppose you only had 4 feet of rope available at the tie-in point with
the rest of the rope just sufficient to reach your friend on the bottom, 4 to i
· would be out of the question. itere, again, the system provides an answer, Rių
a 2 to i using your foot rig, with a tight loop in the 2" weubindt, as the main
line cam, Rig the knee 28sembly as the stop cam and glip the shoulder stra),
still attached to the harness, Off of your shoulder. The shoulder strap is
tightened and placed at the very end of the rope, as a hauling can. 1ou can now
haul while facing away from the drop. You can lean your body and drive with
your legs while pulling yourself along the rope towards the fixed point. with
this maximum effort configuration, one can produce large forces. The arms and
legs are working in the same direction and the load is distributed over a large
area about the hips. If sufficent trees, projections, or irregularities exist,
one might be able to continue past the fixed point, but at least 1 foot will be
gained in each hauling session, even under high loads. When sufficient slack has
been generated, a 4 or 8 to 1 can be rigsed,
The knee assembly may also be used as an automatic-return hauling cam. This
use is particularly appropriate if two Systems are avallable or if a non-igantic
tree is convenient to the edge of the drop. (in the latter case, the shoulder strap
extended with the foot rig with necessary, may be buckled snugly around the tree
to form a good stop cam, Hauling should then be done in a direct line defined by
the stop cam and the point where the rope crosses the edge of the drop.) The
shock cord is tied to a projection close to the vertical plane of the hauling line,
dropward of your hauling stance, A heavy pack can be used instead of a projection
or another caver can just hold or stand on the end of the shock cord. By repos-
itioning your body or retying the shock cord, the tension in the cord can be
easily adjusted so that, as each hauling session is ended, the cam automatically
rides forward, ready for another haul. When more than one knee assembly is useu
in this manner, the rythm and coordination produced often enable large loads to
be raised very rapidly with a straight line 1 to 1 pull and only a few haulers.
