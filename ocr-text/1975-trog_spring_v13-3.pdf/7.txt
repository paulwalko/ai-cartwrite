had their tickets and were cruising through town when they passed a set of funer-
al pylons placed out on the road. With much cunning and subtlety, they slammed
the car to a stop, leaped out, and shoved the pylons in. Less than a mile clown
the road, they were pulled over by a cop. "Holy Shades of BOD Barlow!", Perkins
exclaimed. At any rate, they were taken to the local up who caught them on a
charge of Disorderly Conduct and fined them 14. Unfortunately, the court costs
were $16 apiece so they just managed to make it with 3 to spare between them,

Elsewhere in the news a new grotto has been forigeri: in Rad ord, its name

A fair number of VPI members have shown interest in this rotto. von anderson
has become chairman with assistance from Ed Richardson and Carolyn Lewis from
VPI and Dave Engels and Dr. Reggie Scalero from Radford, This five an team
makes up the Executive Committee. We are hoping for much productive cooperation
between our two grottos.
Our grotto has been engaged in much conservation this past quarter. Unfor-
tunately, it was not underground, We were engaged in the miller Pick-in-up
campaign contest, This contest was between frats and clubs and sororities and
dorms. The object to drink Miller beer for points and clean up miller's trash.
well, the frats drank and we cleaned up. In the en:, we had a 7 tnousand point
lead (our final score was 38,000 points) on the closest frat. As a result of
this display of might, we shall win a fairly valuable prize, resell it for cash,
and increase our depleted treasury.
One last quick note: Fall VAR is doing to be sponsered by VPI this year so
keep your eyes, ears, and nose open for the news. And when the time comes, keeg
your mouth open for the beer. God bless all of you and don't pick your nose wit
any stalactites.
