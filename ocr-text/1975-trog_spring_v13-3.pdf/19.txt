The inspection of Table 1 reveals many intere.ting points. The advantages of
the piggy back system over the block and tackle Sjotent are clearly indicatea in
the Al and number of pulleys columns. Also the use of Carabiner systems wild in
greater than 2 is shown to be self defeating. The ne of the biner 2 to i cholila
be considered when one feels that he must use carried to change the directius
of a rope being used for hauling. The indications are that very large aus Will
be possible, even approaching Ius, if well made, inexpensive, sealed roller Deur-
ing pulleys become available. Therefore, now Ã¼leci in bic: tuture, remember trio
2 to 1 and the picey back systein.
