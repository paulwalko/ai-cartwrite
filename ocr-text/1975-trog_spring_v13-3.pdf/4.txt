THE TLCII TROULODYTE

I address this column to those people who are, have been, or will be, a
voting member of this grotto, What I wish to say has been on my mind for some
time; it concerns the responsibility we all have as active members of the V.2.1.
Grotto. At the end of last quarter, a major change in the Constitution was pend-
ing the approval of the membership. At the same time, we were beginning a search
for candidates for elected Grotto offices. To may dismay, I detected a reat deal
of apathy towards these two issues. We conduct business in the urutto with the
approval of the active membership, not an executive committee like some truttos
do. Our membership resides within a limited geographic area and theoretically
should be able to easily attend the meetings. Instead, it took over a month to
finally act upon the Constitutional amendments. One of the primary reasons for
the delay was that a number of times not enough people showed up at the meeting
to vote on the issue. I realize that notification of the membership concerning
the amendments was not carried out effectively the first time, but this doe: nor
excuse the fact that many members were failing their responsibility to the
Grotto by not showing up, whether important business Wais on the autre. or not.
The only difference between a member and a trainee is the right to vote asid hold
elected office. Certainly by attaining membership a trainee has proved him or
herself to be a competent caver, but a trainee may, at times, be a better caver
than many members,
When a trainee becomes a member this person is taking on a responsibility
to the Grotto not only in terms of what we stand for in cave safety and conser-
vation, but also in terms of the running and administrative functions of the
club. Not everyone needs to take an interest in holding a Grotto office, but
every member has to be ready at all times to use his or her vote in a knowledje-
able and responsible manner. The easiest way to do this is to attend the neeiing
and keep informed as to what is going on. The grapevine is very active, words
on different matters get around fairly easily, but many people have lost contact.
This same responsibility applies to the election of officers. I am sure that
no one ises their vote to elect a friend rather than a person who they realize
would do a better job. The election of officers usually receives a good deal of
attention and an intelligent vote. However, the same does not hold true for an
ordinary meeting when a simple motion over a matter of policy may be the most
important business. The point is, both batters are of equal importance and should
receive the same undivided attention of the membership. We all agree that can
mouting Bet boring with most of the business brought up, but il, only take a
few hours a week. I would like to see in my term as President an increasin.;
concern for the direction the club is heading on the part of a responsible meri-
bership,
Well, that's it for the heavy stuffs so go open another beer.
