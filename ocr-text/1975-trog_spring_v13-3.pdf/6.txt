going to sleep and by 6 o'clock the party was virtually over. About 2 o'clock
it started up again, Freezing people stood around the fire and waited. AS the
day warmed up, so did the adventurous spirit, sob page and ed Loud took their
vehicles and romped over the hillsides. Jim Denton finally recovered from the
previous night and got ivr, Penley's permission to tear up a sticker patcti, in
the process, he knocked:down a tree a got stuck on top of it, tixon's 10 Care

wild activities and the party ended. The field was cleaned, people were cleanesi,
and thousands of drunk drivers attempted to play hide-and-seek with the police.
TWO weeks later, these same drunks and others could be found on the new
River. The event: The VPL Annual Float Trip, more and more people took rafts

daughter (just how old is he, anyhow?) brought a 4 by 8 foot piece of styratoare

with a slow start, the party built up to a climax matched only by the total
eclipse of the moon, much punch was spilled, but more was guzzled down. minor
excitement was created when someone stole a jug of punch, but it was recovere
