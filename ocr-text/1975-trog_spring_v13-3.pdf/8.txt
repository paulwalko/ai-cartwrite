Report on the Accident at Dig Spring
In February of this year, trainee Bill Koerschner and I started ridgewalking
in the Brown's Ridge area of Mercer County, W. Va, near Dry Fork, our effor
were quickly rewarded with several finds, including two springs needing digging
out. One of them, named Dig Spring, was blowing air. This and the hopes of
making a connection, convinced us to begin excavation,
On May 11th, our fourth visit to the spring, we came armed with a winch and
cables to pull a large rock from the entrance. Our working area was an alcove
about ten feet long, eight feet wide, and six to eignt feet high. Two rather larse
blocks lay on the ground, damming the spring. These we wished to winch out as a
sledge hammer had proven worthless the week before.
In order to minimize the effect of mud suction, we started digging around
the rock's base, which would also give us a better hold with the chains. while
we were doing this, bill got carried away and started to dig away from the target
rock; at the base of the blocks forming the right wall. A few minutes after he
started digging there, he said, "I hope this thing doesn't fall on me". Ã€ min-
ute or two later I heard, and then saw from the corner of my eye, some crumbs of
dirt roll down from the side of the block. I looked up, expecting to see some-
one standing above us on the small cliff. What I saw instead was the right wall
of the alcove toppling toward me, In a split second i jumped for my life towaru
the outside of the alcove, yelling as I did, "It's falling, get out!" bill, who
was crouched at the very base of the wall when I yelled, had time to stand up
and make a brief move to his left before he was hit. The wall was composed of
two three to four ton blocks with a half ton of smaller stuff on top. With a
ripping noise, the whole stack toppled, the bottom block was stopped by the tar-
get rock, but the upper block slid off the lower one, hitting bill on the right
side of his body, knocking him dowri.
I got up, dismissing my minor scrapes, and looked over to bill. riig chirt
was in shreds, his shoulder was bent in a grotesque arigle, and a deep souge iri
his lower right arm showed the tendon or bone, tie saili something about going to
black out, so I left for aid, I got a local to call for an ambulance from
Princeton, 15 miles away. While the local waited for the ambulance at my car,
I returned to Bill with some clean clothes to cover the wounds with. I covered
him with the clothes to keep him warm and minimize shock, and kept talking to him
to keep him with us. About forty minutes after the accident, the ambulance crew
arrived. After securing the lower block with a cable, we dug his foot out froin
the rubble and put him in s stretcher. It took another 30 minutes to carry him
back to the road, and about two hours after the accident he was in the hospital..
rie underwent four or five hours of surgery. riis injuries were a broken jaw,
broken shoulder, broken lower right arm, and various nerves, muscles, ana blood
vessels ripped loose from the upper arm. The orthopedic Surgeon who worked on
bill described the injuries to the arm as as bad as he's seen for survivors of
mining accidents. There is considerable question now as to whether any use of
the right arm can be recovered, even with future surgery attempts to put the nerves
back in place.
Even considering the serious injuries sustained by bill, both he and I were
lucky. If I had not heard the crumbs of dirt rollis, neither of us would have
had any warning. I would have been struck frontally and bill woulo have been
pinned or crushed by the lower block. Bill was lucky that the rock hit him while
he was standing and that it didn't hit him more on his head. We were also lucky
that I could go for help.
What can we learn from this? Certainly not that digging should be stopped,
for part of the essence of caving is digging to new passage. It is rather that
entrances feature the more unstable walls and ceilings and cavers should resuect
potentially unstable rocks. Bill and I got too careless, ceased thinking about
collapses. We thought about part of the alcove collapsing after we removed the
target rock, but we didn't think it would happen as soon a3 it did. Perhaps
having only two people digging was unwise, We needed a third ur fourth Dorn.
