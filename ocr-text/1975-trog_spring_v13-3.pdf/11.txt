SPRIN
THE TECH TROGLODYTE

mapped the downstream section of the cave (4700
feet) between the spring and where the slope from the dry entrance encounters
the stream. In order to do so, we removed all loose rocks from the spring, and
all logs and debris from under the bridge nearby: lowering the water level from
3 to 4 inches. After hammering away chert nodules from the six inch near-
siphon at the spring end, we surveyed upstream in spacious passage with water
depths averaging 3 feet, The passage averages 12-15 feet in width and 10-15 feet
in height. It's really worth getting soaked to see. Just before we came to the
upstream near-siphon which seals this section off from the rest of the cave dur-
ing most of the year, we encountered deep water. Using an inner tube and the
tape to retrieve it, we set one station along the wall and crossed over the rest
of the deep area. A later party through this section of the cave punctured an
inner tube trying to get it through the downstream near-siphon.

In what may be a journalistic first, the Letcher County Community Press
(in Kentucky) is running a full page feature called "Cave of the wonin". The
feature is written by Gary Jessey, author of "Letcher County's Pine mountain
Caves", which was panned in the NSS book reviews and banned from the NSS book-
store. April's cave was the Whitesburg Garbage Dump Cave, a heavily decorated
