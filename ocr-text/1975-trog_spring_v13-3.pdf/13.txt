Battle of wounded Knee
Cave Club Crawling Contest
The idea for a crawling contest was first sugested to me by my brother
after hearing tales of the long distances some cavers crawl. It sounded better
when I mentioned this idea to Keith. urtiz; especially if we could crawl arounci
the Tech Drillfield. In order to sell the idea to the administration, we would
disguise the event as a fundraising drive along the same lines as the "flike for
Hunger". The proceeds would go to Muscular Dystriny and we nemed the contest,
in jest, the "Crawl for the Crippled". The Cave in agreed to sponsor this
insanity with the use of its name, people to help organize, and, of course, some
crawlers. Keith got an appointment with some camp!is committee and, much to our
surprise, was granted permission to use the drilli.eo.
A quick letter to the Guiness Book of World Kicords brought back the word
that the current record stood at 6.67 miles set in three hours, twenty minutes.
We were primarily interested in the distance, Duct we kept the time iri mica. He
were also informed that kneepads, gloves and a fivellinute rest per hour wars
allowable. We got under way. Forns were printed, bele was organized, adver-
tisements were placed in the student newspaper and on several radio stations.
Alan Armstrong supervised the layout of the 1000 foot long course, having ue-
cided that this would be easier to mark off and patrol than a course around the
drillfield,
Saturday, April 26th, dawned sunny and hot. At 9:45 the first of ten brave
crawlers got down on all fours and set off. rere was where the put-on ended and
the put-down began, The Crawl was no longer a joking scheme of the future, but a
real event where we had to put our knees where our mouth were, urupped out
first, after one hour and 6000 feet. I had cioco my kneepads after 5000
feet, but to no avail. my knees were killing me. Une look at my kavos convinced
me. Several square inches less skin on the knees: it would be seen often during
the long day.
Others crawled on, though. Reggie Neal, the disc jockey from Christiansbur,
was given all the beer he could drink every time he came in for his breaks. Sev-
eral crawlers had radios dangling from their chests to keep their attention froi
the featureless ground stretching before them and the pain creeping through theli.
Carol Godla had several other things dangling from her chest and it was the high-
light of each lap to pass Carol crawling in the opposite direction, dressed in a
halter top. There was a quiet guy in a red jersey and foam-rubber pads who,
along with Ed Richardson and Keith Urtiz, held up to the grueling one mile-per-
hour pace. Their forin soon developed into a cross between a inonkey walking on
his feet and fists and a very slowly plodding turtle. The disc jockey was still.
moving, but had less laps than the other three. His radio station kept broad-
casting his progress and wishing him luck. The crawlers who dropped out could
be found recuperating at the official's table alors with a sizeable crowd,
When Keith dropped out, it was down to our man, bu Richardson and wave
Smith, the red flash. Neither was close to the record, yet, but both looked
determined enough to break it. A great cry of dejection went up when Ed finally
conceded defeat arter crawling a little over four iniles, A look at his knees
showed little damage because he had kept them dustid with talcum powder. mis
arms had given out on him, however. The crowd of cavers had grown at the offi-
cial's table and all eyes were now fixed on the red I'lash, un his face was a
continious grimace, but he looked determined to go all the way. He had refused
water and was pushing for the last two miles to break the record,
As Dave's pace slowed even more, and he passed the official's table less
often, talk turned to other things. Suddenly a shout rant Out Dave was 32nd-
ing up in defeat and making his way to the table. There, he collapsed, nutter-
ing about sleep and making his statement to the Roanoke Times reporter hori,
mis distance, the best for the day, was 27600 feet, unly 5.2 miles, so toe
record stood. Second place was Ed Richardson with 22000 feet. Keith managed
third place with 16000 feet,
