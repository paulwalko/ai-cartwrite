A4 to 1 pulley System requires 2 pulleys and is shown in figure (in t'i :-
ures 4 to 8, the top cam and associated Items
clarity. The stop can must be used in an actual haul though). A second 2 to i
is pulling on the hauling line of our original 2 to i. If only one fixod point
is available, as in figure 5, it is easy to see how the system in figure ? misht
evolve in some people's minds. This is the configuration which is inuicated in
the article on "Pit Rescue", page 4 of Nylon Highw 2. But pulley C in figure
7 is completely unnecessaryi for when haulins, no movement takes place over pulley
C. It just sits there! (Try the arrangement to satisfy your own mind.) The dashed
line in figure 5 illustrates how the 4 to 1 could easily be rigsed with one roue,
The behavior of the 4 to 1 piggy back pulley system must be understood if it
is to be used efficiently. Initial rigging, immediately prior to a hauling ses-
sion, is shown in figure 5. The haul is over, figure 6, when pulley B collapses
into the fixed point. The system must be re-extended for any additional recovery.
Note that pulley A still remains about ž o.f its ir.itial distance from the fixed
point, This type of 4 to 1 can therefore only be used with the purchase methou
(as opposed to the suggestion in the previously citeci article).
Suppose that the purchase method was not used and the 4 to 1 in figure
was extended to the very bottom of the pit. The main line would be discarded
since pulleys A and B would be at the bottom. Uur victim would clin directly into
pulley A with a carabiner and the haul would begin. The victim would be halfway
up the drop when pulley B collapsed into the fixed point. There would be no
further progress. Even if the configuration in figure 7 were used, the victim
would be halfway up the drop when the system collapsed from a to i to a system
with a mechanical advantage close to or below 1! The purchase method must be issu
with all the pulley:'Systems we are discussing except the 2 to 1.
If each caver would carry 2 small rescue pulleys, he would be capable of
constructing the ideal 1 to 1 by himself, and absolutely sensational systeins are
possible with a group of caver's, For example, in the same play back liner
that the 4 to 1 was ¿enerateri, pulley Systems of 26 thouretical mechanical dviri-
tage may be constructed; where is the number of pulleys involved. Viln j juli-
eys, figure 8, an ideal mechanical advantage of 2133 could be obtained, or if it
pulleys were available, 2+=16, or,..
in the classic block and tackle configuration, that arransement used sost
frequently on a world-wide all occassion basis, the ideal efficiency of the pull-
ey systein is equal to the number of pulleys plus 1 or P+1. Block and tackle
systems can be developed on one axle or inultiple axles. Higure 9 illustrates
some block and tackle arrangements.
The energy lost as friction, G, as a pulley rotates on its axle or a rope
slides over a carabiner is:
ü = Uxb'
where U is the coefficient of friction and L' is the load perpendicular to the
moving surfaces. The actual mechanical advantage, or actual efficiency, mu, is:
AE = L/
(2)
where L is the load to be raised and is the force necessary to move the load
continuously (in this discussion, the energy of the rope deformation as it crosses
the pulley or carabiner is considered to be negligible). In clauic block and
tackle (B&T) type pulley systems, the load upon each pulley, l', is reduced as
more pulleys are incorporated to produce systems of creater theoretical or iucal
efficiency, IE. Thus friction and AE calculations become a bit more involved
than is generally realized. But we diverge! in the B&T method, each pulley
in a block is under an equal load and
Lį = 11/P1
(3)
where L, is the load on the 'entire block, bi is this load on each pulley ir block
1, and Bi is the number of pulleys in the block. similarly,
Lź = 12/12
