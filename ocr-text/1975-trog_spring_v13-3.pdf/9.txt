Rescue? Bullshit!

Few Grottos are directing efforts towards developing personnel competency
in cave rescue. Too often, practice rescues are only basic; involving passage
in no manner complex or difficult. Situations far underground and behind mul-
tiple ascents, descents, climbs, and crawls are briefly considered and then sí3-
missed. The logistics of a major multi-squad relief effort, demanding rapici nu
continuous activity over a period of 12-14 hours, are never considered. À 12
hour mock rescue would define the limits of individual human endurance in a real
manner and might actually humble with reality those forever stating their grotto's
rescue capabilities. But, they might have to piss dinner or tax their fladby
bodies.
to tackle a cave (with one 70' drop, climbs, and straddle pits) that re-
quires the use of a mile of rope to rescue a stretcher case only 800 feet
underground, Fail, but learn! Don't even tackle ine ti shtest crawl problem
that you know of in a popular cave, but rescue over the other difficult physical
obstacles you can find: tight drops, long distance crawls and sloping passage,
or straddle pits and chimneys. Don't throw in sub-freezing weather; snow, ice,
freezing rain, or flood. Make it easy!
Your rescue call comes in after you have already been caving all day. HOW
pick your body off the floor, move accurately and think straišht for the next six
strenous hours. Only four men can be gathered for a rescue effort. The team
inoves through difficult trunk, 3/4 of a mile under cround, and finds that the
initial evaluation of the situation is far too optimistic, low many members of
your grotto could competently 30lo to the entrance? Or would your leader, with
the situation demanding that he, with his medical abilities (how many members of
your grotto are trained at the level of Emergency medical Technician or above?)
and two others remain with the injured partie, be the only one capable of the
feat? Rescue? Bullshit!
This brings us to the purpose of this article: Good cavers are made, not
born! You can walk in Mammoth's trunk passage all your life and still get psyched
at a tight crawl. You might never know a single knot, or know how to belay
correctly, behave at the edge of a drop, use vertical year, chimney, climba
ladder, drive bolts, cave dive, or know about exposure, jumars fouling in mun,
or,.. For we learn by doing. You can't know what endurance is until you prezy
its mental limits. You cannot learn to think and climb until you accept the
challange and maybe take a few falls,
An individual who thinks that a "Super-Caver" is any guy who can cover 100'
of rope in under 10 minutes is pitifully naive, but too many cavers think that
they are great and can handle anything! Without knowing if 1 about hard caving
realities. This is where the accidents happen. Rescue is fine, but only by
striving to make yourself into an all-around experienced, competent, physically
fit, thinking caver can you reduce your chance of being an accident. That's the
key to the whole idea of rescue---Preventing the Accident!
There are idiots who try to do a 500' pit without lovey and have no idea
about which end of a rack goes where. Tell some people about exposure in a civen
cave and they act as if they are perpetual heat machines, uthers don't know.
that it is advisable to try to keep dry and that this may take some effort from
their flabby bodies. A "vertical caver" (read it on the back of his helmet)
rappels into a deep pit without checking the ledge; and a 4 pound rock is sit-
ting loose at the lip, just 6" from the rope. FOR GUL'S SARE Trilith!! delayers
belay and aren't sure if the rope they are holding soes directly to the climber
or into the pile of extra rope,
Never cave alone, Never jump in a cave. Ies, parrot the phrases. Never
think. Sit in your own little programed box and grow mentally fat and content.
Don't try rock climbing. Always be a follower. Yes, little Corporal, your
General will always be healthy and capable of continuing. You will always be
belayed. And il you have trouble on a thirty foot climb, while pushing a lead,
or while 100' down a rope, have faith, You are not alone, for an Angel of
Mercy will fly to you and wipe your nose and tie your shoes for you. WAKE UP,
cavers! It's your ass in the cave. You've been alone since you came out of
your mother's womb. It's you, your knowledge, and equipment against the envi-
ronment. Wise up before somebody kills you,
