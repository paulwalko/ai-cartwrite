SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1975
Listen, When the wind blows, turn to the source and perhaps you will hear it.
At first, it sounds like the sea in a seashell held to the ear, but it slowly
evolves; changing 'tone and intensity. Animals cringe when they hear it, babies
in their cradles cry with an unknown fear, old men clutch their hearts in terror
as they perceive it. It could be the anguish of a god crying out or the protest
of mother nature against man's insidious advance, No, it is merely the sound
of cavers in action. Thus, thens learn of our deeds, Learn, for this is
The Grotto Grapevine
Another scholastic year has swept inextricably past. School has taken its
toll on our motley crewMany sheep shall desert the fold, uthers, however, will
remain ensnared by unexplained forces. Randy wood and Kathy Cronau are graduating,
but both will return to graduate work in the fall. Wichael Richardson will pull
free of the school and no one (except maybe Stringfellow) really knows what he
plans to do. Twila Frieders has completed her masters work here. Both she and
her husband, though, have been incredibly silent recently. Former President
Doug Yeatts will escape this hole with nore than he had when he came---3oots is
expecting in the fall, Tom dalhoun is going to masters work at another school,
Thor Brecht will complete his masters work this summer and go nis way from there,
Bob Simonds will be leaving us, as will Jean McCarthy; together. Carolyn Lewis
will obtain her Bachelor's and her Master's this summer. Ed Loud, if he doesn't
flunk out this quarter, will graduate, sunch of smart-asses!
Our good friend, Eros still lingers around. Aside from the pending wedding
of Randy Wood and Kathy Cronau, mentioned in the previous Trog, one other wedding
and one more engagement have appeared. Bob Simonds and Jean McCarthy will be
sharing their caving gear in matrimonial harmony starting in early June. The
other, perhaps more startling news, is the announcement that mark Slusarski, the
Polish Dog, is now engaged to a girl he met at school in Tennessee (hmm, do I hear
someone whistling the refrain to "Tennessee Stud"?).
A,I. Cartwright, too, has been busy. He has spurred us to overthrow our old
regime and place a new puppet in charge, (Some people dare to call this turmoil
an election), Mike Wolf is now the president of the grotto. His number two in
charge of trainees, etc., is Bob Alderson, Supporting them is the treaurer,
Domie Carter. The actual person-behind-the-scene-who-runs-everything is the new
all-powerful secretary, Lor Marshall Zarth Nolan Windle (who by an amazing coin-
cidence and a powerful show of force is also the Tros cditor). To maintain the
power of the club, we have brought in more cave-fodder. New members are: Dou
Thompson, Ed Devine and Chuck Shorten, VPI numbers are now up to 188 for any
who would keep track. A. I. Cartwright, himself, was busy caving while these
events took place. He so abused the Library in Clover Hollow that it had to be
taken out before it completely collapsed. In a show of bravado and ignorance,
Mike Wolf led a trip to put new satiating material in the cave, In turn, olu
Art. granted us much pleasure with our own entertainment,
Yes, indeed; VPI craves entertainment, on the 10th of May we and all of our
friends charged madly into Mr. Penley's field armed with tents, sleeping bags,
and five beer kegs. The fiasco that followed, more commonly called the VPI Picnic,
was a typical success, By Sunday morning bodies were strewn from the entrance to
Newberry's down to the road, few people could recall all the events of that night.
It all started calmly enough people tearing up the road, getting stuck iri
the mud, being pushed out, while others played volleyball and fell in the mud, and
still others drank---and fell in the mud, As darkness fell, most poople watcheredi
around the fire and there talked until Don Davison whipped out his suitar and
started the singing. Skip Whitehurst amazed 'everyone by the utter vulgarity and
perversity of the words that spewed forth from his mouth. We heard some of the
most incredible lyrics to "Wild West Show" and "Rodriguez, the Mexican Pervert",
and all were impressed by the physical display of "Swing Low, Sweet Onariot".
In the mean while, Jim Denton decided to impress his friends so he took his viss
ugly Toyota, turned on the back-up lights, and got out of the Toy. The Toy,
though, decided to back up anyway. Doing so, it smashed people aside and ran
over two dining canapes before Don Davison (ever present as it were) leaped into
