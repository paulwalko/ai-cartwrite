Hauling
PART 1
Simple pulley systems of great mechanical advantage can easily be constructed
using the concept of the 2 to 1 pulley system, the most basic pulley configuration.
Pulley systems thus constructed have less energy loss through friction than any
other pulley arrangements of the same ideal mechanical advantare (because there
are fewer pulleys); therefore with these piggy back sys tems the actual mechanical
advantage is the maximum obtainable, we shall exline the 2 to 1 and develop a
4 to 1 system requiring the minimum equipment with which it is possible to con
struct the ideal 4 to 11 one fixed point, one rope, 2 pulleys, and 2 Gibbs AS-
cenders. An 8 to 1 requiring no additional equipment, save one pulley, is also
shown and therein the principles for constructing more powerful systems are il-
lustrated,
In principle, a 2 to 1 pulley system requires only one pulley, one rope, and
one fixed point, as is shown in figure 1. AS a result of the physical limitations
imposed by available rope lengths and a desire for simplicity and safety, pulley
systems used in actual deep pit hauls are modified to incorporate the purchase
method. Figure 2 illustrates the configuration of a 2 to 1 pulley system using
the purchase method, ready for a hauling session to begin, Figure 3, in contrast,
portrays the same system at the end of a hauling session, iet us follow a complete
hauling session starting with figure 2. iiere, the main line cam is close to the
stop cam, which is engaged and holds the load of the main line, AS the hauling
line is pulled, the stop can releases itself and wing into the line of pull.
When sufficient recovery has occured, pulley will collapse into the fixed point
and further progress cannot be gained, as shown in figure 3. is tension in the
hauling line is gradually released (to minimize shock loading), the stop cam sete
itself and swings into the line between the fixed uirit and the point at which
the main line crosses the lip of the drop. The slop cam now bears the main line
load and the main line cam is slid down near 'the stop cam (as in figure 2) and
another hauling session may be initiated,
The cam tie, in figures 2 and 3, serves to hold the stop cam in the most
dropward position possible. Thus, its use helps to minimize the inevitable shock
loading which occurs when tension in the hauling line is released i.e. each time
a hauling session ends or when the entire hauling crew slips!). if an inflexible
cam tie, such as avalanche cord, etc., is used, c. very sloppy and inefficient sys-
tem will result, especially if the hauling direction differs considerably from the
anchoring direction (for, if tight, the cam tie, being unable to stretch, will
cause a friction producing bend at the stop cam or if tied loosely, hauling must
be done in one specific direction to both eliminate the bend and maximize the re-
covery). With a shock cord cam tie, as found on the Davison System Knee assembly,
the stop cam always rides in the most dropward position possible so that recovery
is maximized and no bend is produced. The flexibility of the shock cord auto-
matically compensates for changes in hauling direction. The behavior of the shock
cord cam tie is illustrated in figures 2 and 3, but is idore drama lically shown in
figures 10 and 11. The cam tie may be secured to a heavy pack or a rock projec-
tion. If no cam tie is used at all, an extra caver must stand at the stop cala
and hold it in position manually. He must minimize :shock loading and assure that
the stop cam engages and releases at the appropriate times, iote that, in figures
2 and 3, the stop cam has been anchored to the only fixed point available. ien-
erally, a second fixed point closer to the drop can be used instead; but we are
trying to work with minimum requirementsboth equipment-wise and satural!
