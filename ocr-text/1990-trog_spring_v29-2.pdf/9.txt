how large a 700' drop was, and in the process realized just how much of a complete idiot I was for doing this.
Many people compare Guaguas with Neversink. They say, "It's like Neversink, only bigger." What they leave
out is the fact that it is about 328,765,983 times bigger that Neversink. Neversink freaked me out when I
bounced it, Guaguas freaked me out about 328,765,983 times worse. This happened as soon as I started
rappelling. You go over a lip, and then suddenly the wall your feet were on turns into a ceiling. This "ceiling"
runs almost perfectly horizontal, away from you, and meets a wall somewhere over the horizon. So within the
course of one vertical foot, you have gone from being on a wall, to being well over a hundred feet from any wall,
and you still have 700' left to do down. I instantly felt a tremendous surge of agoraphobia overcome me, as well
as the acrophobia I was already experiencing.
Luckily, since we rigged two ropes, I rappeled down with somebody--Bob. Bob had decided before he even got
on rope that he was going to be scared going down this thing--I wished I was as wise. I staarted talking to him,
once I semi-regained my wits, and eventually he told me, "Thanks. You're really making this easier for me." I
didn't have the nerve to tell him that the only reason I was talking to him was to keep myself from going
completely schizo on rappel. We both made our way slowly to the bottom, so as not to damage the rope. Just as
in Bourboillon, my legs were numb from my seat, which seemed more like a Nazi torture device to me, and my
arms were numb from straining as hard as I could to keep myself rappelling slow.
I finally reached the bottom of the drop, wondering if my legs and arms were still attached to me, to promptly
learn from Maureen that one can rappel quite fast down these things with no more damage to the rope than by
rappelling slowly. I wanted to shoot myself for not knowing this earlier, and for getting the idea that you have to
rappel extremely slowly down long drops in the first place, but could not since I could not find either of my arms
anymore.
The bottom of Guaguas is beautiful. It is covered with all sorts of lovely plant life and bird guano. There is a
huge steep slope here which leads into a psuedo-cave, through an entrance equivalent in size to Venezuela. This
slope is COVERED with loose rocks, only held in place by their weight and the bird guano which they are sitting
in. People going down the slope could not help but each knock down about 726,500 of these rocks. What made
this interesting was that the acoustics of the psuedo-cave make each little pebble fall sound like a earthquake of
magnitude 8 on the Richter scale. After two people went down there, I was starting to wonder if thermonuclear
war had finally occurred. ("Hello bottom? This is top. Did the weather forecast call for any mushroom clouds
today?")
I didn't go schizo on rappel. I made up for this by going schizo on the way back up. I climbed on a
ropewalker, and Dave whom I was climbing with used a sit-stand rig. What I did not realize is that those things
create a LARGE up and down bounce (no, not the fabric softener) in the rope.
This "bounce" feels like what would happen if Godzilla reached over the top of the drop and started shaking your
rope in an effort to get you off it, so he would not have to eat nylon when he consumed you.
I had a good view of the low side, which several Europeans had rigged with 8 mm rope. They were "frogging"
their way up the drop and were bounding comparatively more than I was, but this didn't make me feel any better.
"So what if they're on thinner rope, they're bouncing more, and it's not breaking!", I thought, "They're not me!"
I looked down with every few steps I took, and realized that I had an incredibly long way to fall. I started
praying for the first time in my life as I thought, "Heck, if I fall, I'll die of starvation before I hit bottom! I don't
wanna die like that! Waaaaaah!" As I almost started into a temper-tantrum reminiscent of a 4-year old, I made a
resolution to bring a gun with me on the next long drop I do. That way, if I fall, I can shoot myself quickly, and
won't have to wait to hit bottom. (Sound like a good idea?)
The biggest relief of my life came when I reached the lip. I got a firm grip on it with both hands, ready to hold
myself up in case the rope finally decided to break when I was so close to safety. (Never mind the fact that if it
did, I would also have to support the weight of the rope and the "human jumping bean" climbing below me,
which I was not humanly capable of!) At last I was safe!
As soon as I could, I made my way further upward, passing the first of two lips, and promptly getting stuck in
the second. After a few minutes of struggling to no avail, Cecile noticed me there, and said, "Do you want a
cowtail?"
DUH!! I FELT STUPID! This was my first time climbing top-tandem, and I had forgot completely that there
was a cowtail. This infuriated me! I was only two feet from where I could derig, but I could not get there because
I had forgot about the cowtail! After a few more minutes, and a lovely fiasco, I finally got over the lip. I
seriously pondered becoming deeply religious, as I thanked God when I put my feet down on solid ground.
Ch. 5 -- Rie Choy:
The last cave we did was Rio Choy. It was a nice, leisurely way to end out a great trip. The sky was clear, the
weather was beautiful, and I had Rush plying away in my walkman as we set off for a "little hikeâ€œ down some
railroad tracks to the cave. And we continued to hike. And we continued to hike, with still no sign of the cave in
