Grotto Grapevine
Here's the news from Lake Blacksburg: The year started off with billyuns and billyuns of
people going to Mexico on three trips with many of the usual people (Cecile, Jerry etc.) and
many first-timers. 'Nuff said here. Lots of heavy caving going on, notably Paul (Berta's
husband) Kirchman's Bone sheep-dip trip. Other frequented spots are Newberry's, Bane
Spring etc. Bill's Rappel is officially 160.7 ft. deep, but the depth of Triple Wells is still
being debated. 29 folks went to TAG this spring break, but it wasn't good enough to write
an article about. GCCS is still going on, but there hasn't been much progress. Bob & Jean
Simonds, and Walt Pirie went to Costa Rica again over spring break. You can read up on
these trips in the rest of the Trog.
About banquet: 144 people showed up for banquet in February at the Blacksburg Rec.
Center. Dr. Leffler talked on bats, and Dr. Mengak talked on rats. Both profess at Ferrum
College. Ed Fortney won the A.I. Cartwright award for his years of doing bridge sessions,
leading trainee trips, and other club activities. Krisen Posson was trainee-of-the-year. There
were many competitors for the "safe driver" award, but Joe Uknalis' and Mike Fiore's West
Virginia incident won them top honors and an LTD wheel. Is it just coincidence that they're
both from New Jersey? Dave "Chummer" Warren won the traditional flame out award, but
there were so many challengers that Maurya Fisher, Nat Serbu, Kristen Posson, Sara
Vieweg & Joe Uknalis won the group flames, flameout bucket. Mike Sziede won the PW
award, a pink collar so Sally can lead him around. The 1st annual Glen & Alice and Paul &
Berta award went to Maurya Fisher & Chris "Jake" Brown, who earned a crowbar for the
impressive face locking that they demonstrated for the crowd. Cecile won a guano cluster for
putting up with many caver parties. Our favorite landowner, Buddy Penley, received a photo
album covering years of Skydusky Hollow events, and caver events he's attended, plus a
Cave Board poster. Some of the guests that attended from out of town included Lawrence
Britt (who's getting out of the Navy in about a 1.5 years), Tim Kilby (who owns New River
cave), and Chip Clark (who's recovering from his back surgery just fine). John Holsinger
showed up at the after-banquet party. Nancy & Alan Knewstep received a shower gift at the
party--their baby girl, Lindsay, was born in February. The Devines brought their new baby,
Amanda, to the banquet.
Now for the gossip, and hearsay: Philip Balister became unemployed, moved in with Ed
Fortney, and is now employed by GE, Schenectady. He'll be world traveling. Doug Bruce
moved to Fredericksburg, VA for several months as part of his job with the Frames. Dave
Cinsavich is employed at Draper Aden here in Blacksburg after receiving DWI number 3. I
don't think those events are related. Mike Futrell is in Harrisonburg, and Viola Ritchie is in .
Warm Springs. Hmmm. Dougo just turned 21 and threw up on himself. Glad it wasn't
someone else. Will and Jenny Allender ne√© Ford are moving to Winchester, VA. Craig
Ferguson got his pilot's license. Kay Johnson got a promotion at the library. Jim Gamble is
job hunting. Barbara Graham is back in Lexington, KY doing caving stuff. Jean Hartman
should be returning from Turkey sometime. Bill Hohenboken went to New Zealand and
went caving. Pete Sauvigne was in China during the fall and did some caving. Gabi moved
to a new location in NOVA. Al Ostrowski (Al Who) joined the army; yes it's true! Chris
Swine went to Lechiguilla (the L-word) to be a photo sherpa, despite undisclosed injuries.
Mike Sziede will be going to NOVA to work on a career one can build on. Chuck & Pat
Shorten bought a new house, but we don't know where. Howard, Polly, & kids Dame
survived the big earthquake in October just fine. Ed, Liz & kids Morgan survived Hurricane
Hugo ok. Glen and Alice's wedding is scheduled for October 20th. Don Davison called up
the Zokaites' recently--he and Cheryl are alive and well. Hillary Minich has turned into a
lean mean caving machine, and has done a lot of caving in the L-word. Doug Dodd has
