Mexico -- From a Voting Trainee's Point of View
Ch. 1: Getting therei
The most exciting, cave club related thing I have done so far (besides throwing my guts up at the more wine
party at OTR) has to have been the trip to Mexico I went on this past Christmas.
Mexico, land of sunshine, beautiful mountains, and cheap beer. It is also the land of interstate highways that
are about as wide as the average person's driveway, water which you can't drink, toilets that don't flush, and the
Peso (the Mexican unit of currency) which exchanges at about 2.74 x 1026 Pesos to one U.S. dollar. Put these
things aside, however, and Mexico is a really neat place.
From the very start, the trip to Mexico was a completely new experience for me. For example, as soon as the
three of us, Cecile, her boyfriend Bob, and me, pulled out of the Sign-Out driveway, Cecile's "Batrnnr" had a
transmission problem (I had never been in a vehicle with a transmission problem before! What fun!). This did
not phase us, and we continued on our journey.
We stopped in Chatanooga, TN with our two Toyota Four-Runners to pick up three more people; Maureen--our
trip leader, Bill and Dave--a jerk, and about 13 tons more gear than either truck was rated to handle. We then
continued down to Louisiana, where we traveled on a 30-mile bridge over the wettest part of the Mississippi delta
swamp.
We then went on to the city of Lake Charles, LA, affectionately nicknamed "The Armpit of America". This
city exudes an odor similar to what would occur if 126 male elephants, in heat, from a distance of six inches,
waved their genitals in you face all at once.
To add to this, as is always the case in every VPI expedition, it was unseasonably cold. Likewise, it
rained--freezing rain.. This left us in a four hour traffic jam heading into Texas, with a bunch of southern drivers
who had never heard the words "32Â° F" before. UUGH!
The ice let up at Houston, and we continued on to San Antonio, the southernmost point in Texas where
non-Hispanics live. Unfortunately, now the Batrnnr's transmission sounded like my grandfather gurgling,
mouthwash. So we stopped in Laredo, at the Tex-Mex border, to have the Batrnnr looked at, and found out that
we had been driving all the way from Blacksburg with essentially no grease in the
transmission! What a trip!
We got the problem reduced (the tranny now sounded only like my grandmother gurgling mouthwash), and
continued on across the Mexican border, each of us collecting enough pesos on the way to pay off our national
debt several hundred times over if they were dollars. We then proceeded about two hundred yards to a line of about
4.52 x 1014 people, which we had to wait in to get our visas for Mexico. Several fortnights later, we emerged
with our visas, and continued on to San Luis Potosi.
One of the first things I noticed about Mexico was that the food was great! Sometimes I had no idea what I was
ordering (basically because I knew about three Mexican words--denero, cervesa, and tequila), but I did not care,
because I knew almost whatever I ordered would be good. As well as the food, the sodas were a neat experience.
In Mexico, aside from Coke, they have apple, apricot and pineapple flavored sodas, to name a few. I only drank
Coke once while in Mexico, and it was a real let down.
We spent Christmas eve in the city of San Luis Potosi. It was spectacular. In the market district, the streets
were covered with vendors selling everything from cheap American junk, to authentic Mexican treaures, to cheap
Mexican junk. It seemed that almost all the town was out combing the streets, doing last-minute Christmas .
shopping.
Also out, as always, were many poor, homeless beggars. Cecile gave some logs of gum (huge, round sticks) to
some children who were going around begging for money. Word quickly spread throughout the entire younger
population of Mexico, from Cancun to Baja, that Cecile was giving out freebies, and pretty soon Cecile found
herself surrounded by every child in Mexico who could walk. Surprisingly, she had brought enough gum to give
every child a log.
The night was not over yet. A Mexican caver, Carlos, took us to a party that another Mexican caver, Sylvia,
was throwing. The Mexican definition of 'party' is a bunch of people sitting around, having a good time,
introducing newcomers (us) to their nineteen children, and eating the equivalent of 23 meals in one sitting. This
was my first taste of Mexican hospitality, and I loved it! I was feeling great, except for the fact that I had eaten
more that night than the city of Los Angeles normally consumes in a week.
Ch.2--Cueva de Borboillon;
We met up with the last three people of our group (Bob, Mike, and April--three really cool people from N.Y.C),
and did our first cave, Cueva de Bourboillon, on Christmas day. What we did of it took us through a little amount
of sporting passage, and down a 718' drop at the end of it. This more than tripled the size of the largest drop I had
