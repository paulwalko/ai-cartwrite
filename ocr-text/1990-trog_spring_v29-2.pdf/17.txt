The First Time is Always the Sweetest?
My first caving trip as a prospective member came the morning after my first
Bargerfest experience. I was a bit uncomfortable caving when I could barely
remember my name, but Paul assured me it would be a fun, relatively easy trip. Hell,
why shouldn't I trust my life to this leather clad cave sprinter with the snake dangling
from his ear? Besides, having been a JMU caver until this semester, the name "spring
Hollow" conjured up images of spacious, well lit passages, perhaps some hand rails,
New Age music and a shop hawking cheese doodles and "I survived Spring Hollow"
tee shirts. To clue you in to exactly how wrong I was, the trip consisted of myself, Bill,
Paul Kirchman and the Zoes.
One of the first indications that maybe I should have stayed at Bargerfest was an
exciting tummy crawl... no, a tummy slithcer, through a low stream passage. In my
infinite wimpiness, I had been praying for a dry cave. The cave gods must have been
pissed at me for neglecting to sacrifice a virgin at the party (I swear, I tried! Do you
know how hard it is to find a virgin at a keg party?), because doing that particular
passage was akin to dancing the jitter bug in a trash compactor full of dirty diapers.
"How much longer, Papa Smurf?" "A lot longer than you think. Stop wimpering and
crawl, you little blue vermin". Thus inspired, I managed to escape with both breasts still
intact, only to come face to face with the BEAST.
Yes, it was everybody's good friend, Mr. Cable Ladder! Actually, going down was
pretty cool. Things began to look pretty UNcool as I contemplated how I was supposed
to get back up the damn thing. I'm convinced that the only thing worse than your first
time up a cable ladder is your first time up a cable ladder ina waterfall. "Use your legs!"
Simple enough. "Don't look up!" Oh, okay. "Don't look at the rope!" Got it. "Don't look
down!" Aaah! No kidding. At this point, I began to panic. quite frankly, if I'd been the
other cavers on the trip, I would have shot me down and ended my misery. Luckily,
nobody there had a gun. In fact, they were so nice and patient about the whole thing
began to think they passed out Valiums while I was rigging in.
Spring Hollow was not only a very challenging cave, (to me at least!) it was also
very beautiful. One of the most impressive things about the pretties was the great care
that people had taken topreserve their beauty. The respect shown for the delicacy of
the formations rally made them a thousand times more special to me. I kept waiting for
Queen Mab or Pan or one of those fairy dudes to show up and dance around. Maybe
toss a few rose petals, drink some nectar from the crystal clear soda straws.
When we got out of the cave, I discovered that being exhaused and cold and wet
has certain advantages. One, the beer that awaits you becomes a golden elixir the
washes down the firne particles of dirt and mud clinging to your tongue. Two, it saves.
the lives of people who look at thier watch and exclaim, "Gee, we were only in there for
six and a half hours. I was hoping to get in at least eight." Paul was lucky I couldn't
move my arm to swat him.
Finally, some advice tothose first time trainees who want to got to Spring Hollow:
1. Make sure you stop by to meet the landowner, Buddy Penley. This man is a real
man. Not only is he personable and funny but he's pretty cute for an older guy.
2. GO CAVING WITH CAROL ZO!!! She brought more food than I eat in a week.
Awesome food too. Cookies and sandwiches and cold beer and even smoked oysters.
Good stuff!
3. Never, never, never go to Bargerfestif you want to be alert and awake for caving the
next day. Never go to Bargerfest if you value your neurons. You may wake up a few IQ
points lower
