The Force
I was working late in Ithe lab. I was having problems debugging the system on my
home made Cray super computer. Perhaps it was a foolish thought but I thought that it
might be a problem with a funky looking electrical do-hicky in the back. Well as I sat
there contemplating the possibliity of fiddling with that electrical thing-a-ma-bob,
heard a low pitched rumblingsound coming from beneath me. As the rumbling grew
louder, I began to realize that something was amiss and proceeded to move away from
the area at a rather high velocity. No sooner had I leapt from my chair to the door,
when my chair and the whole computer began sinking inot the floor. Five years of
researchwere being swallowed up by the earth.
I turned away from the scene in horror. It seemed as though the gods were against
me. Would I ever leave Tech? But then I thought of how much money I had sunk into
this computer. I turned back to the disatrous scene and what to my suprose did I see,
but a hugh hole in the middle of my lab where my supercomputer and chair once
stood. The meaning of this all seemed clear, I wasn't meant to build a super computer
and revolutionize the world. I was a caver, the hardy type. When I wasn't working i
was caving. The gods were telling me something important, and I wasn't about to
ignore them.
I went over and peered in the hole. down in the bottom of this 60 some odd foot pit
was the sparkling mass that was once my supercomputer. The airflow was amazingly
strong. Thad never felt a breeze that strong before. Gathering some wires, diodes,
dixie cups and ice cube trays from the far corners of the lab, I jerry rigged a simple
airflow meter.
Hmmm? 50 mphwinds! Incredible. I dug up the only computer I could find in the
lab to do some complex calculations estimating length of passage and such.
Unfortunately it was a Timex Sinclair. After five minutes of programming and two hours
of run time the display indicated that there could be over a thousand miles of passage.
Well, Ineeded to check this out. I mean, could the world's largest cave be right under
my lab?
I was able to find several hundred feet of industrial strength extension cord, and a
portable spot light. Perfect, a rope that could double as alight source. I quickly
plugged in the extension cord and then proceeded to arm rappel down it.
The spot light worked amazingly well in lighting up the pit, but there was one small
problem, I could'nt see any walls to the pit. Is this possible? I thought. I reached the
bottom, wishing there had been more of a drop, my arms still had plenty of flesh on
them.
It seemed as though there were no walls in this place. All I could see was a shaft of
light from my lab. My spot light showed nothing but a floor that was dusty and dirty.
The floor went in all directions. It seemed as though I had infinite choices of which way
to go, but one direction seemed to call to me. It was a gut feeling. The kind you get
when something is wrong. But this feeling was a good feeling, and I was in a state of
mind to trust this feeling.
Thad planty of extension cord and a light as bright s the sun, so I figured, "what the
heck, lets try and find a wall". So in accordance with my gut feelingl headed taht way. I
had no idea where I was going but it just felt right. I suddenly felt an urge to move
quicker. Something was pulling me. It was an indescribable force. Thad to go.
I felt my pace ever increasing. Soon I found myself running. Still I saw no wall. |
was no longer in sight of my lab, but it did'nt matter. The passage was going, I was
going. It all seemed to be working.
