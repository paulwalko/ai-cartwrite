NOTES ON THE GENERAL DISASSOCIATION
OF HARD HATS, CHIN STRAPS, AND QUICK DEATH
Paul Kirchman
Yes, I can see you all asking yourselves what hard hats and chin straps have to do
with quick death. But then what does toe cheese have to do with cheetos? It's just another
example of the fundamental interconnectedness of things..
Anyway, this article is aimed at you cavers in the transition zone between "punk" and
"old fart". You've been caving for a while, you've got money and you're upgrading your
gear. Maybe you get a new helmet. You're tired of your old miners helmet with its limp,
elastic chin strap. Besides, the damn thing falls off when you look up; it falls off when you
look down; it flies off when you sneeze. So you buy yourself a more advanced (expensive)
helmet with a four point suspension made of solid webbing. "This sucker", you think to
yourself, "ain't never coming off". What you have probably forgotten here, is that there are
times when you need to have your helmet fall off.
The scenario goes like this: chimney along in something tall and narrow, slip down
an inch or so leaving your helmet stuck above you. There's no problem with an elastic chin
strap; it has happened to many of us. However, this type of incident with a solid helmet
suspension has claimed at least one life. A lesson with this high a price tag should never
be forgotten.
I never really worried about this much until I found myself the proud owner of one
of these fine helmets. The problem has been addressed. Some people use a breakaway
stitched section; others follow the example of the palace guards and don't put the strap
under the chin; others still, don't think about it. THINK ABOUT IT!!!
. Being on the whole, rather lazy, I naturally stumbled on an easy to implement
solution. The male component of a fastex buckle has two prongs which hook the sides of
the female (God I love it when I talk like that). If these hooks are filed so that they slope
in the opposite direction, the buckle itself becomes a reusable breakaway point. The
amount of slope determines the force required to pull the connection apart. Experiment,
change the slope until you can pull the helmet off with some difficulty, but without breaking
your neck. If you overdo it, a new buckle is cheap enough so file away with impunity.
