Sheep Dip, Sheep Shit, Dip Shit
I should have known better than to go caving with a man who actually leaves
signout by 8 AM, but I did'nt. Paul Kirchman, Tom Bank, Dave Colatosti, Natalie,
Chummer & I took a joyous trip into the Sheep's Dip section of Bone Cave a couple of
weeks ago.
As for leaving at 8 AM and entering the cave by 11:30 the piddle factor was low so
we were forced to sacrifice Hoss to appease the cave Gods (an entire bottle of Mescal-
the worm and all- will keep Hoss from caving the next day). The entrance to Bone was
amazing, so much booming passage but suddenly I had the same feeling that Alice
must have had in Wonderland - either I'm growing or this cave is shrinking. The
passage seemed to be getting smaller and smaller and then we entered S.O.B. alley.
Awaiting us at the other.end was the Devil's Pinch which we had been hearing horrid
stories about. Nat and I damaged our female appendages (Ed. note- they seemed OK
at the last sauna party) but were lucky to escape with them still attached. We weren't
too far from this long awaited siphon, Sheep's Dip and the anticipation was killing us-
ya right.
Paul was the first to go through. I thought his splashing sounds were pretty amusing
and we all assumed ourselves that he must be kidding. Dave C. went next and
informed us that Paul was not joking. As Nat splashed through, she cursed Paul's frist
born girl to be a sorority bimbo and the men seemed to be complaining of four tonsils
(what do you suppose that means?).
With the exception of our heads and one dry strip down the middle of our backs we
were soaked and decided to take a break. So, what's that quote from Speleorata?
"Cave food on the bottom of your pack is edible if you scrap it first."- I think describes
the condition our bagels were in but there's a difference between being edible and
actually palatable. We held off on the bagels in the hopes that they would dry out and
shrink to their original size. We continued on to do a loop with lots of pretties including
some fossilized coral tht will forever be imprinted on my hands. So, it was back
through the Sheep's Dip, the pinch, and S.O.B. alley where we took another break and
for the second time Paul offered us his cheese bread that Suki the dog had denied
before the trip. This time the candy bars were gone and only the bagel's were left, so
we devoured the cheese bread. Finally, when we got back to the booming passage
we practically ran out to the star filled night in hopes to find Hoss with beer & pizza- no
such luck.
The satisfaction of the whole trip came the next morning when Paul Kirchman
admitted to actually being sore- what an accomplishment.
