January 13, a very unlucky day
Well, I guess I have put it off long enough. Now it is time to write my article. fortunately for
me (unfortunately for those involved) Mike and Joe have provided me with an exciting story to
relate. It all started at the party the night before (dosen't everything?) at Fergie's place. Good thing
parties are there once a year, evil omen that it was. Rumor floated around that there was going to be
à Norman trip the next day. I figured "Wow, great way to jump back into caving after break".
After Ihad made the proper arrangements to meet the group out at the Farm, I inquired as to just
how large our group had grown to. When I heard the number ten, I thought "Tomorrow is going to
be long". Ha, a lọt I knew!
Well, we arrived at the Farm at 10 AM and suprisingly enough, found activity! The rest of the
group (those who did not live there). arrived promptly at noon. Seeing as no one had the foresight
to purchase a large bus the previous evening, we were forced to take numerous smaller vehicles.
So off set Mike, Maurya and myself in Mike's ailing green whisp.of iron oxide. Now I will take
this minute to point out that Mike did admit that he was reluctant to take his car, but did anyway,
against his better judgement. We were closely followed by Joe's Subaru and Mac's Pac Rat. The
ride to the cave was uneventful, at first. At an early stop along 460, Mac blissfully sailed past our
vehicles, only to be informed by his passengers that the others had stopped. This first time was just
practice, because he did turn around. Later, on 219, he breezed right by, unmindful of our
passionate attempts to flag him down. This particular turn of events left Mac & Co. clueless to the
tragic happenings we later experienced. This occured approximately ten minutes from the Norman
entrance.
Being in West Virginia, of course Norman is located on a twisty back road. While travel on this
sort of thorofare is tricky at best under ideal conditions, when there is snow pack on the road it
becomes a nightmarish test of both the driver and vechicle. Since we were in Mike's car, still
blazing tyhe trail up front, we noticed the problem first. This problem, the first of many, was a
large car stuck on the snow trying to go up hill. A large local car. If the people who lived here
could'nt make it we did'nt stand a chance. This was a bad sign. Luck prevailed however, and not
only did the local car finally make it, but some foreign cars too (namely us). Not minutes later, a
tremendous brown Cadillac zoomed by, heading the other way. We made it past this behemoth, but
Joe was not as fortuitous as we later found out.
A couple of miles and a few tricky hills later, we realized that Joe was no longer following us on
our quest for Norman and/or Mac. The milk of human kindness flowed forth from our hearts and
overcame our primal urge to cave, so we turned back to seek Joe. On our way back yet another.
large car (maybe a Chevy, don't they drive anything small in WV, or are those Chevettes just
waiting to grow up?) stopped to warn us about an accident up ahead. Well, at least now we knew
what hapened to Ūke. It was Mike's theory that Joe had backed into Mac but that wasn't the case.
What we discovered was the Joe had clipped the enormous Caddy that we had spotted earlier
barreling down te road. Joe & crew did not look particularly happy, and the locals he hit looked
downright dour. Having solved half of our puzzlement, we took off again toward the cave to find
the other missing part of our party. Much to our chagrin, whilst going around a corner, we ahem,
shall I say, encountered a pickup truck. the damage to Mike's Corolla looked remarkably similar to
that of Joe's Subaru. There was consolation in the fact that we weren't troubling the Sheriff too
much, seeing as he was already coming out to investigate Joe's mishap.
Well, to make a long story short, Mac & friends eventually showed up, as did the police who
measured, inspected, doublechecked, investigated, wrote down names, and did everything short of
taking 27 8x10 color glossy photos with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each
one... any way, and finally declared that the cavers were at fault. Thus persecuted adn denied our
inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of booming pasage we headed home with our tails
between our legs, or rather our fenders tucked up into our wheel wells. We made it with the help of
acidic BK coffee ( we replaced the fine coffee at this fast food restaruant with oil sludge and rusting
lug nuts), Neil Young, and lively discourse on any and every topic known to man. I think that next
time someone announces a Norman trip, I will propose that we fly there.
