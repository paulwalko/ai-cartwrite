sight! And then I saw something off in the distance that resembled St. Louis. And we continued to hike. And
then I noticed a sign that said "Welcome to Deluth". And then we had to cross a railroad bridge. A high bridge.
A very high Bridge! Which providedus with a very good view of the river that seemed to be several miles below
it, due to the fact that there was enough space between the railroad ties we were stepping over for a train to fall
through! Crossing this bridge was "interesting", just about as "interesting" as having gall stones and diarrhea at
the same time. And there, alas, was the cave. Actually we only hiked a few km down the track, and I enjoyed it,
but the Jewish blood in me makes me able to complain about everything.
The cave had a fairly well-blazed path to it--a concrete staircase. My superb deductive reasoning told me
someone might have been here before! My suspicions were further confirmed when we reached the cave mouth,
and found a religious shrine inside it. But the shrine did contain a little statue of what I believe was the virgin
Mary holding baby Jesus. Could that be considered "virgin" passage???
Rio Choy is similar to Steven's Gap. Add a little cave on top of Steven's Gap, take away the waterfall, and add
a river at the bottom and you have Rio Choy. Basically what this means is that you rappel into a river. We were
not sure of this fact, because you cannot see the bottom of the drop from the top, so we tossed a rock down it to
make sure we knew what were rappeling into. We heard "thump-thump-thump" as it rolled down a hill. And then
nothing
Wait a second! If there was water down there, we would have heard a "Splash!", right? What was going on
here?
We tossed a few more rocks down, producing the same effect as the first. By this time I was getting worried. I
prayed that there would be a river down the drop. I also decided that if the bottom was dry, the only logical thing
to do would be to KILL whoever told us about this cave, making us hike out here.
This cave, like the others we had done, was full of "firsts" for me. To start, preparing for the drop, I undressed
in a religious shrine for my first time is that a sin?). Than I caved barefoot for the first time, as I proceeded down
to the drop. I must have been a sight to see, wearing nothing but a pair of shorts, my seat, my helmet, and
holding a mini-mag in my mouth to see with as I clipped in my rack. A picture of me at this time, set next to
the picture of Paul Hess wielding a machet√© on-rope at last semester's Pembroke tyrolean, with a big red "X"
through both would probably make a poster that would win an award from any grotto's safety committee! Well, if
I was safe all the time, someone might actually accuse me of being smart! I couldn't risk that!
The first thing I noticed about barefoot rappelling was that it hurts! The rough rock face my feet were on felt
like it was covered with broken glass. The pain was worsened by the fact that I still was not sure what lay below
me. However, I was definately anxious to get down there to give my feet a rest.
I came down to a ledge, and went over its lip. Then, all of a sudden, I found myself in an immense room, with
a huge pool of crystal clear turquoise water at the bottom and light shining in from all directions. It seemed like
entering heaven. I was waiting to see Noah, sailing an ark into the pool. I had to stop a second and think, "Did I
die?". Then I remembered that if I had, I would have going in the other direction.
Having realized that I was alive, I promptly continued to descend, landing in a floating inner-tube, where I got
off-rope. This was the life! There I was, relaxing in an inner-tube, floating in the middle of an area that looked
exactly like paradise to me. I felt like I was in a summer time Bud-Lite commercial. All I needed now were the
lovely women that usually accompany Spuds MacKenzie, and some ice-cold brewskies!
I got out of the tube and went for a swim. The only problem was I had one more phallic device attached to me
than I normally have. Something much bigger and harder--my rack. This thing made swimming quite difficult,
and drowning quite easy. I now know how John Holmes must have felt every time he went for a dip--and I pity
him!
Aside from that, the water was great. It was thermally heated, and was a hell of a lot warmer than the air
outside. Leaving it took all of the little strength I could muster. I felt like jumping back into the water, when I
found myself going through "the walk of living hell", going back up a hill, back across the railroad tracks (which
included crossing an even longer, higher bridge than the first one we had done), and finally back up the concrete
staircase to the cave entrance. I was barefoot, and because of this, someone had taken great care to make sure that
the entire path I followed was littered with small, sharp rocks, and even broken glass in a few placed. The walk
felt like an unlucky experience crossing a minefield. Next time I go there, I'm bringing sandals!
With the conclusion of that day, and another spent at Mexpelio, we headed home. Before we left, I gave Raul, a
Mexican caver, the latest copy of the Trog, in an effort to be "diplomatic" and "spread the word" of VPI. I have
my mind set to return there someday, and leave him with another.
