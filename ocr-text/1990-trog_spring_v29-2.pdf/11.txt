Another Mexico Story
If you want to go to Mexico in 1990 with Ko and Brian this article is for you. If you have been this will not
be of much interest. (ed. note- not much fun to type either- Jerry writes in a version of cuneiform)
There is more to a Mexican cave trip than the rope work. It takes planning for both the individuals and the
rope. The individual should make real sure their vertical gear is in top shape. I recommend that if the
deepest drop you've climbed is in Virginia you go to TAG fall cave in. This will test your rig and endurance.
A frog works great for 100-200 feet, but remember that Golondrinas is over 1000 feet. Practice getting off
rope with someone below you-getting off rope after a tandem climb is tricky. Check your vertical rig. A
gibbs ascender with a worn cam or jaw should be replaced. Frayed webbing replaced. Add a fourth
ascender , preferably a petzl or jumar. This is for getting off rope and for spaftey at the top of a drop. A
gibbs will work but is not as flexible. A cow tail is nice for safety, especially at Golondrinas. A battery
powered light is best for this type of caving. A jug of water wouldnt hurt either.
In the clothing department pack lightly. There are many people going and you won't be able to change
clothes twice a day. If you go to Tananul take a bathing suit. The area of Mexico you are visiting is very
conservative. Skimpy clothing is nice but out of place in Tamapatz. The temperature in Mexico will be 70Â°
or better. It will rain. Take lightweight boots that can double as hiking and vertical boots. Some hikes to
caves are long and almost always uphill.
: Money- Paul Kirchman and I drove our vans 4120 miles each. Fuel cost $335/van. It's 15 hours to the
border, folks drive in 3-4 hour shifts. You can survive on $150 - this will buy misc food, trinkets and booze.
Our trip combined cost about $200/ea for gas, camping, hotels, group food and hidden expenses.
Planning and flexibility are essential to having a good trip. Several SOBER meetings should be called.
At these you will discuss destinations, activities, shopping, eating etc. Costs can vary greatly- Hotel
Victoria 170,000 pesos ($60) for all eight persons. Hotel Valles camping -2 vans 23,000 pesos ($8),
Tamapatz ($6 per room), Hotel Taminul $20 for 2 person-room. You could slip extra people in but don't
overdo it. Food there is expensive and bad. Advantages are hot spring pool, real toilets and hot water.
When camping simple meals are the easiest to make and clean up. We ate in groups of 4, which was our
van size. Bring snack food, if you are a coffee addict bring a separate stove to make your brew. Eating out
is fun but can be expensive. We had our most fun at El Ganolero east of Taninul. Worth the trip. The little
one room restruant in Tamapatz is also worth eating at, it takes 23 hours to process (sic).
Mexican shopping is challanging. Buy in pesos and be prepared to bargin & shop around. Decide as a
group when and how long to shop. Buying booze is cheap. Remember about the duty for bringing
alcohol back across the border. The Blanco is a big discount store woth a try.
Many articles have been written for caving in Mexico so I wont add anything to this. Golandrinas is 3
miles from Tamapatz and you need a 3/8" bolt. Tamapats is 30 miles from Hotel Valles. It's 11.5 miles up
the dirt road to Tamapatz.
Get the car insurance before you cross the border. It costs the same and they give you trip ideas. Carry
your title, or some form of permission to posess the car. Passports cost $35 and is easier at times at the
border. If you are a US citizen all you need is a birth certificate. For crossing back into the US have all of
you r Mexican purchaces accessable. Be polite and act cool. If you act nervous they suspect something.
Answer questions directly and do not elaborate. If they want to know something they will ask.
The last suggestion is to learn some Spanish. Even a small amount helps. You are in their country so be
cool. I hope this helps in preparing for a trip to Mexico.
