Our Glorious President's Column
Well the semester is finally coming to a close, and Joe and Kay tell me that I must
uphold the tradition of the President's column.
Elections were held in March, & the new officers are:
President: Me.
Vice President: Dave Colatosti
Treasurer: Adam Hungerford
Secretary: Mike3 Horne
during spring break, 28 people went to TAG and did a lot of vertical work. Our
membership is up to 322 people and although it is the end of the year we have had a
large turnout of new people at our meetings. Also being springtime, the club has been
taking a lot of scouts and community groups on Novice trips.
Picnic is in the planning. It will be at Buddy Penley's as usual, but due to the
success of 3 kegs fo Killians at last year's picnic we've opted for all 6 kegs to be
Killians. A lot of interest has been expressed by new members concerning possible
Mexico trips this Christmas. Unfortunately, the number interested far surpasses the
number of available positions so far. So if any of you are planning a Mexico trip for
Christmas and have some open spaces, I know of numerous people who would really
appreciate the trip.
As far as official business goes...the club has purchased some new file cabinets to
accomodate our growing piles of mail. Also, in an effort to pay some of our expenses,
we've been considering auctioning our extra older trogs at OTR.
O well, enough of my ramblings.
Enjoy.

President of Vice Column
Well, the deadline for this was about two hours ago, so I guess now is about the best time to
write it. Yup, I'm the new President of Vice. And actually, the job seems cool so far. I guess I
have secretly wanted to be vice presidentsince I became a member. I have a lot of respect for the
training programand I enjoy teaching people something that I really have fun doing. I suppose that
is my reasoning for wanting the job.
Kudos to Scott "Hoss" Leiffer (#320), Kristen Posson (#321) and Sara Vieweg (#322) for
earning their membership. the testing went OK, thanks to the help of our former VP Brian
Cruickshank.
So what does this up coming year have instore in the way of VP stuff?? Well lots 'o trainee
trips. If trainees want to cave, I'll cave. Hopefully I will have some sort of agenda to follow for
bridge sessions next year, so people that already know the ups and downs canexperiment and learn
other neat and important vertical things. Bridge sessions? Lets just say the worse the weather the
more fun you can have at the bridge. (IE. I will be there every Friday and more if need be, no
matter what the weather is!!
In closing (since my buzz is wearing off) I want to encourage trainees to learn a lot, cave hard,
and party hard (remember it takes practice to earn the flame out award). And hey, I hope to learn as
much as I can over the next year too.
David Colatosti
President of Vice
