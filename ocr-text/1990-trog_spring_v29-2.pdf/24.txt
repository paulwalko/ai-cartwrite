What Makes Gorp Good
and
What Makes Good Gorp
Caving in it's own right is completely illogical. A group of people travelling through a dark, damp and
dangerous domain sounds downright discouraging. If you're not on your toes you'll find yourself on your
end. One thing you don't need is a complaining stomach.
Cave trips can easily last 10 hours. Since McDonalds has yet to laocate inside a cave (imagine that), the
food must come along for the ride. Don't worry, due to the fact that a good large and strong breakfast is
strongly recommended/required, a charcoal grill IS NOT NEEDED on the average cave trip. All you need is
gorp.
But just what is gorp? Does it increase the shelf life of a twinkie? No. Does it cause cancer in laboratory
animals? No. Does it make slimy, hungry cavers happy? Yes, yes, YES!!
Gorp is an art. It evoled from California granola, to trail mix, to what it is now. It's durable, inexpensive and
easy to make. Everyone has their own personal formula for their favorite snack food. While formulating
your own recipie, remember that the final product will spend it's life in a plastic bottle. It had better not spoil
when taken in the caving under world. Gorp is also the fuel your body needs for that 'kick in the pants' to
get you up that last climb. Sugars and carbohydrates work best. Pretzels and potato chips are good for a
couple of days, then they turn to stale crumbs, Hard candy works well also, but a couple of trips to a damp
cave will turn the gumdrops and butterscotches into a brick of sugar. Other varieties of mixed nuts,
chocolates or dried fruits work well. My personal suggestion is to constantly mix and rotate the food to
constantly refine your own unique brand of gorp. Not having a nagging stomach enhances the enjoyment
of a cave trip.

Freud Meets Dr. Seuss in a Cave
As the date for my official membership draws near
and I find myself looking back on the year
I ponder caves and bridges gone by
I drink a beer and ask myself "why?"
Why do I climb and crawl underground
When I could be snuggled in bed safe and sound?.
I could be home sleeping off the ache in my head
But I'm here in this cave dodging batshit instead
It must be the clothing-army is in!
I also get off on black and blue shins
And I groove on mud & guano & pain
And I live for changing my clothes in the rain
I cave for stalagmites, symbolic and sleek
The sight of the gypsum flowers just makes me weep
I thrive on cold & fear & sweat
The equipment I need has put me in debt
It's masochistic! It's twisted! Yet I know in my heart
I'll cave for these reasons till I'm an old fart
