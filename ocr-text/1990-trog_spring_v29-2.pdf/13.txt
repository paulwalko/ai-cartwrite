VPI CAVERS PARTICIPATE IN
CRE '90
idea was to eliminate many of the long and
hot hikes to and from caves that had been
such a part of CRE '89.

During the evening hours of March 17th,
I was laying in a hammock reading a well
thumbed issue of Analog by the light of my
REI headlamp when an object glanced off the
page in front of me and fell to the ground. I
leaned over to take a look at four-inch flying
cockroach sitting there admonishing me with
his antennae before he turned and clattered
off over the dried bamboo leaves. It was our
fourth night at Remote Camp outside Cuidad
Neily, Costa Rica. It was very dark and very
quiet and a chill ran up my spine. I decided
it was time to quit reading and head for the
safety of the mosquito netting of the tent. On
the way, my light caught the reflections of a
pair of eyes about fifty feet beyond the tent.
Was it the pig that had inspected our garbage
pit an hour or so before, or was it something
else? I'll never know.
After a day in Base Camp to get oriented
and to acclimate ourselves to the heat, Walt
and Jean and I headed up to Remote Camp.
The hike up was grueling. What weight we
saved in our packs by eliminating winter
backpacking gear was more than made up for
by the extra caving gear we carried. Back-
ups for everything from boots to lights were
brought along; it was a long way back to the
club store. As we climbed, we noticed
limestone rocks which gave evidence to the
karst nature of the terrain that was hidden by
the jungle. We trod on plants that would cost
in a greenhouse back home while stately
mahogany trees dominated overhead. The
trail opened to a view across a wide valley to
mountains off in the distance. The Rio
Corredor could be heard rumbling in a
canyon below. As we watched, a raptor
climbed out of the canyon, soared up past
us, and disappeared into the blue without so
much as fláº¡pping a wing. We continued
along an easier path through a banana
plantation, past a small farm and finally to
Remote Camp.
Only a week previously, Walt Pirie, Jean
and myself had left the comforts of
Blacksburg to take part in the second NSS
Costa Rica Expedition, CRE '90. Three
days and three airline flights later, we were
standing alone at the end of a gravel landing
strip in the jungle in southeastern Costa Rica.
Our only connection to civilization was a
promise from from a taxi driver named
Carlos that he would come back for us in a
half-hour. Twenty minutes later we were
bouncing along in his diesel Land Cruiser on
the way to Base Camp where we met up with
about thirty other cavers who had already
been there for a week. Some we had known
from the first Costa Rica trip last year, CRE
'89, but most were new to us.
Remote Camp consisted of a small house
that the expedition rented for the project and
usually hosted 8 to 10 cavers at a time. We
stored our gear on the dirt floor inside,
cooked and ate on what passed for a front
porch, and slept in our tents around the
outside. Water ran continuously from a
plastic pipe coming from a spring about a
quarter mile away. From a basin in the
kitchen, the water continued on out of the
house into a shower stall made caver-style
from black plastic and duct tape. It was not
considered polite to wash dishes while
someone was in the shower. Remote Camp
cuisine consisted of canned and dried food
from back home together with fresh fruit and
vegetables from the local area.
Unlike last year's project which had only
one camp, CRE '90 had two camps: a Base
Camp on the outskirts of Ciudad Neily near
where CRE '89 had been located, and a
Remote Camp located about 3 kilometers up
steep jungle trails. Base Camp was quite
civilized and took care of the bulk of the
scientific work. It was equiped with a hydro
lab, a biological lab, an advanced first aid
station, and even a computer for reducing
survey data. Remote Camp was quite a bit
more primitive but it was close to many of
the caves that needed to be surveyed. The
The next day, Walt and Jean and I started
on a project that would dominate our
participation in CRE '90: the mapping of
Caverna La Bruja. "La bruja" translates to
"the witch." Walt played the role of sketch
while Jean was lead tape and I did my best to
read instruments. For instruments, I
prefered to use a tripod mounted Brunton for
azimuth and a Sisteko for clino. The cave
