How to be considerate to your Fellow Cavers
1. Do not eat chili or refried bean's for breakfast the morning of a caving trip. Enough
said?
2. If caving with spouse/better half/someone you picked up at the Ton and are trying to
scare off, please consider other caver's hormonal needs. If you can't control the urge
to smooch or cop a feel, it is polite to at least offer to share with those not involved in
the relationship.
3. It is physically dangerous as well as psycologically damaging to taunt and tease
those members who spent the evening worshipping the porcelean god. If you still feel
the need to engage in such cruel behavior, it is advisable to always go down rope after
the tauntee in case they decide to show you exactly how much you are tormenting
them.
4. Try to refrain from such graphic commentary as "be careful here, this is where
what's his name fell and splatted like a rotten watermelon off a skyscraper. Boy, was
he a mess, his brains were oozing and, hey! there's the stalagmite where he speared
his balls!". Seriously folks, this is especially discouraging for trainees who spent the
night like the poor soul in guideline #3.
5. Leave your load behind. In other words, the cave is not the place to dwell aloud on
your daily trials and tribulatioons. Most people find it difficult to enjoy the trip if
somebody else insists on moaning about their boss, hemmoroids, dovorce, childhood
traumas, etc. Also in poor taste is transferrance of your anger onto other cavers. The
following is a dramatic example of the potential consequences of such behaivor.
Caver#1 tension!
Caver#2 What the hell do you mean by that? I suppose you've been
talking to Betty Sue about my little problem. Well let me
tell you buster, if you think I'm gonna belay a busybody like
you you're dead wrong. Besides, you still owe me five bucks.
Caver#1 AAAAAAAAH!! Splat.
6. When exiting in sub-zero weather, it is extremely uncool tokeep announcing exactly
how cold out it is. Such insightful observations as
"Damn, I bet it's below zero out here! Boy, are we gonna freeze tonight!" are rather
redundant when a snow drift covers the entrance and your cave pants are standing on
their own.
Learning proper cave ettiquite is like learning to rappel, climb, or tie knots. Indeed, it is
a skill that takes lots of thought and practice to master. While most of the time none of
us really gives a flying *!$# who does what, you never know when a little conscientious
behaviour modification (or behavior repression as the case may be) might saye your
life.
