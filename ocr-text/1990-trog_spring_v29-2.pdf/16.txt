Fresh, Young and Tight
In those wonderful days before I joined the cave club, I heard the phrase "fresh.
young and tight". You all know eactly the context in which it was used. Well, after an
interesting experience in Starnes cave I realized that this phrase is often used
incorrectly. The phrase tht is all too often used in feference to a you thful, virgin female
is much more true underground than above.
You see, I had this interesting little experience in Starnes that began at a stream
crawl in the lower section. We were following our fearless leader, Dave Colatosti,
through the very meaning of cold. It was a small stream running down the middle of a
fairly nice crawlway. Just before we headed into the crawl Dave made the statement
that I would go last so that I could help from behind if necessary. Thad no problem with
this, I mean, what man in his right mind would not want to crawl behind Loretta, Natlalie
and 'Rapunzel"? What I failed to realize was that Dave had other things in mind.
We slipped down through the crawl with no problems to the end where a very cruel
rock jutted down from the ceiling. The ceiling was only 18 or 20 inches high with a 2
inch deep stream. This mean little rock decided to take up residence right over a rise
in the floor where the stream formed a small fall. The hole that was left between rock
and floor was about 8 or 10 inches high. No problem. Plenty of room. Wrong!! When
it came to be my turn to slide through this hole I found that there was no place to put my
legs. They were off at a funny angle to the rest of my body. I decided to live with it and
slithered through the hole into the room on the other side. At least most of me did. Of
course it had to happen. Yeah, that's right. I got my ass stuck under the rock. So here
I was with my ass stuck under a rock and a lake building up in front of my chest from
the stream that couldn'nt get past me. After struggling for about 10 minutes, I looked up
the passage to see our fearless leader coming back to rescue me. Or so I thought. He
had to make a few rude, crude, and obnoxious comments concerning the part of my
anatomy that was stuck. Finally he decided to give me a hand. A simple push into a
different angle did the trick.
I will never forget the primise I made after I heaved my bulk into that room. Dave,
you better not either. If you ever get stuck or something even remotely similar, I will act
on it. I'll admit one thing though, the stream was fresh, I was young, and the passage
was tight.
