entrance to Base Camp with ice-cold
Imperiales,
had a 95-foot pit entrance and a walk-in
entrance at the end of a large sink. The
several hundred foot connecting passage was
rather nasty, particularly near the pit. Costa
Rican bats are rather robust critters,
especially when compared to their gringo
cousins. Add to that the fact that they feed
12 months a year, and the result is that the
guano is always fresh and slimy.
Fortuneately, that bats seemed to prefer the
area near the pit entrance leaving the rest of
the cave relatively clean. From the walk-in
entrance, the cave descended along about a
40 to 45-degree fault to the top of a drop.
· The drop was typically rigged with a rope
and rappelled dowm to a stream: Then to
climb out, the rope was used as a safety.
Although the climb gave the illusion of being
much steeper, The survey revealed that it
followed the same 40 to 45-degree slope as
the rest of the cave. The illusion could have
been caused by the fact that it "stairstepped"
between levels and pitches of about 15 or 20
feet.
We were going to take it easy the
following day but then Bananal disease hit.
Bananal was a going virgin cave on the other
side of the Rio Corredor from La Bruja that
promissed the be "the" cave of CRE '90.
Naturally, Walt and Jean and I didn't want to
miss out. The next morning, we and five
other survey teams headed in. We should
have known what we were in for when the
last thing Jeff Uhl, the survey coordinator,
said as he ducked into the entrance was,
"Just remember, I didn't force you to come
into this cave." Well, he sure didn't have to
force us to leave, either. Four nasty hours
and several wrong turns later we finally
figured out where we were supposed to start
mapping. We then proceeded to map six
stations in two hours before we decided to
quit. We decided that we didn't go to Costa
Rica to suffer so we headed out of the cave.
Upon exiting the cave, the first stop was the
Rio Corredor where we jumped in, clothes,
cave packs and all, in an attempt to get rid of
all the mud we had collected. A more
thorough cleaning would have to wait until
the next day.
At the bottom of the drop a rather large
river flowed over some nice rapids.
Upstream and downstream it sumped in large
pools so that stream passage only extended
about 50 feet in either direction. The pools
supported large populations of catfish
measuring up to about 8 inches in length and
pigmented. They didn't seem to be too
bothered by our presence and we could even
reach down and pet them without difficulty.
There were also quite a few little animals that
looked like crayfish to me although the
English translation of their local name was
"shrimp."
By this time, CRE '90 was winding
down. Jean and Walt went to a well
decorated, although dead, cave called La
Grand Galeria, while I lazed around camp
praticing my Spanish with the Ticos. The
next day we packed up and rode a
government bus back to San José.
And two days after that we were once
again in the comforts of Blacksburg: 40
degrees and raining.
It took us five trips to survey La Bruja
including one day to tie the two entrances to
each other and to an overland survey.
Meanwhile, other cavers surveyed
neighboring caves to see how everything
lined up. We believe that La Bruja is in the
same fault as several other caves and that all
the caves share a common underground
river. As we got ready to leave Costa Rica,
the hydrologists set traps and released die.
So far, I have not heard the results.
Five days at Remote Camp was enough,
however. We were ready to head down to
Base Camp and COLD BEER. And the
camp cook obliged us by meeting at us to the
