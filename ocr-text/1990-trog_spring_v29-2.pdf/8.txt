The moment I started clipping in my rack to go down this drop, a sudden paranoia overtook me (affectionately
called Altitude Sickness and Stupidity--ASS). I started thinking, "Holy shit! It's a long way down there! If you
rappel too fast, you'll melt the rope and die! If you fall, You'll die! If you die, you'll be dead! (0.k...so I'm not
the smartest person) Why can't I be doing something safe now--like getting laid!
As I descended into the black abyss, my seat felt like a wire saw trying to cut through my legs. I could see
people below me--actually tiny pinpoints of light that appeared to be several light years away. So I continued to
rappel. After what felt like several minutes, I looked down again, only to see that the pinpoints of light at the
bottom did not look like they were getting any closer. By this time my legs were getting numb from my seat,
and every muscle in my arms was getting strained from trying to rappel slowly so my rack would not get too hot
and melt the rope.
After what seemed an hour, I reached the bottom of the drop, with absolutely no feeling left in my arms and
legs. I got off rope, and stumbled around like a quadraplegic having muscle spasms. When I got some blood flow
back through my body and brain, I noticed I was in a large room. LARGE! Like what seemed to be about the
size of a small country, with a ceiling as high as the sky. I was impressed.
After several hours, I got to climb out of the drop. On long drops such as this, you usually climb tandem.
This beats solo climbing, because you always have someone to talk to, and exchange questions like, "You do this
often?", "How much more do you think we have to go?", "Are you giong to throw up?", and "Are we dead yet?"
We finally reached the top of the drop, exhausted, with our clothes completely soaked from sweat (you generate
a lot of sweat going up 700'). However, we still had to wait for two more people to come up, because then we.
were going to be joined by the rest of our party (who had climbed up earlier and were now at camp) and haul out
our 800 rope.
My climbing partner, Maureen, decided to use this time wisely, and fell asleep as soon as she got off rope. I
tried this too, but found out that the firmness and support provided by a rock "mattress" is much too hard for me.
I was glad that I could not fall asleep when Maureen woke up about a half hour later, with a body temp. of about
54' from the now cold--sweat soaked clothes she was wearing.
Unfortunately, the last two climbers were not even close to the top, and the fascists of our party, who were
already above ground (and dry and warm!), had not come back, as they should have done an hour ago. So, since
Maureen felt like she was going to die if she stayed underground another minute, she decided we should
immediately get out, and haul the rope up tomorrow. This greatly relieved me, for I did not feel much better than
Maureen (my body temp. was only about 55').
As we left the cave, I looked back at its entrance, which now looked about as enticing to walk into as the mouth
of one of the creatures in the movie "Aliens". I then looked up, saw a sky full of stars, and smiled to see that
there was no ceiling above me. "When it feels so good to get out of a cave, why the hell do I go into them in the
first place?", I thought. The reason was obvious: stupidity--a certain studity which I'm proud of.
Ch. 3 -- Mexpelio and Mecos:
The next day, after Cecile clothed the entire village next to Bourboillon (she should get the cave club
philanthropic award), we headed on to Mexpelio, an international caving convention going on near the town of
Valles. Mexpelio was staged in an old "resort" that was probably in slightly worse condition than Alcatraz.
However, it had all the modern conveniences--unpotable running water, showers with no hot water, and toilets that
did not flush (whose contents actually moaned back to you in anger when you tried to relieve yourself.) What
more could you ask for!
After we were all settled in at Mexpelio, we headed off for a leisurely day at Mecos, a state park with "dozens" of
beautiful waterfalls. Unfortunately, Mecos also contains a couple of electric power stations, aqueducts, and, I can
only assume, a dam. I figured this out as soon as I noticed I was walking on a large, recently dry stream bed.
This because especially evident when Maureen pointed to a semi-cliff face and told us, "See that? That was a huge
waterfall the last time I was here!!" Somehow, I found it hard to appreciate her description of swimming in a
place that was now nothing but mud covered rocks. Even though at least three of the largest waterfalls were
"turned off", the still immense pools of crystal clear, turquoise water, along with the several smaller waterfalls
downstream (and the cervesa stand) was still enough to make Mecos an impressive sight. It was even more
impressive to me when I dove into the water, and found it to be about 1/8Â° above freezing, sending me into near
hypothermic shock, and almost claiming my balls.
Ch. 4 -- Guaguas:
The day after Mecos, we went to Guaguas, a pit up near Golandrinas. Guaguas has two sides to rig from--490'.
on the low side, and 700' on the high side. We rigged the high side, of course, since we were manly! It was quite
interesting to do this after doing the in-cave 700' drop in Bourboillon two days earlier. Now I got to see exactly
