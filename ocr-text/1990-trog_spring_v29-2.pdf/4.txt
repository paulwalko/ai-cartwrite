Editor's Column
Well, another year draws to a close. And the officers are late in getting their
articles in as usual. It's an unusual situation being an editor, we really can't
take the credit for the quality, except in cases where people hand you 3 pages
of chickenscratch and say "it's rough, edit it". Thanks to everyone who kept an
ear out for qoutable quotes. Hope everyone has a fun summer. chow! UKE
Once again the Trog has been hurriedly typed in time to get it to the printer
so it will be out next Friday. It's all part of the process of putting out a newsletter
for a student grotto. We use borrowed equipment, low funds, and switch editors
at least every couple years. Our purpose is to inform and entertain anyone
who's interested about the VPI Grotto. The Trog has always tried to reflect the
personality of its authors, so we accept some pretty tasteless material. I feel the
editor is more of a proof-reader than an actual editor, but we do chop material
sometimes. Many thanks to those who've contributed anything to the Trog! |
hope the summer will generate some good articles for next fall's Trog. Kay
