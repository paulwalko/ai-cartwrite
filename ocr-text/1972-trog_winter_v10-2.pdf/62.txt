PROUD MARY
Left a good job in the city,
Working for the man ev'ry night and day,
And I never lost one ininute of sleepin'
Worrying about the way things might have been.
BIG WHEEL KEEP ON TURNIN'
Em
PROUD MARY KEEP ON BURNIN'
G
ROLLIN', ROLLIN'
ROLLIN' ON THE RIVER.
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis,
Pumped a lot of pain in New Orleans,
But i never saw the good side of the city
Until I hitched a ride on a river boat queen.
REFRA√çN
If you come down to the river,
Bet you gonna find some people who live,
You don't have to worry 'cause you have no money,
People on the river are happy to give.
REFRAIN
Rollin', rollin'
Rollin' on the river.
