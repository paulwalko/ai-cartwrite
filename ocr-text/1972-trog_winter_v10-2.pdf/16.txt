I went into a tavern one evening near Luray,

A forty year old waitress to me these words did say.

I see you are a caver, not just a common bum
For no, one. but a caver,r p√∫tg carbide in his 'rum,
I had a caver lover, his equal I never saw,
If you poured cave mud in it, he'd crawl right thru a straw.
He never washed the cave mud, from off his horny hide,
He said it improved the friction, when down the rope he'd slide,
My lover came to see me, before a descent one day,
He held me in a fond embrace, that broke three vertebrae.
He kissed me when we parted, so hard it broke my jaw,
I could not speak to tell him, his rope had thirteen flaws.
I peered into the entrance, and saw my lover go,
Sliding gaily downward, five hundred feet below.
The cave it tried to kill him, it tried it's level best,
But pits and chimneys were for him, a game and not a test,
The crawlway squeezed to nothing and breakdown covered the floor,
But when the whole earth split in two, my lover caved no more.
They tried in vain to pull him out, his bones were all they saved,
They made him into pitons, to conquer virgin caves. .
And so I lost my lover, and to this tawern I've come,
Here I wait til someone, puts carbide in his rum.
