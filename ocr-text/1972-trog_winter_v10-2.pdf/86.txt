And then the ship Bahama Star comes steamin' through the night
and sees the Castle burnin', it is a terrible sight
"Jum? down, jump down," her captain cries, "7e'll save you if
we can."
And the paint on his funnels is n-fryin'.'
God hel: the ones who sleep below, and cannot find the way, ij
Thank God for those we rescued, upon this awful day..,
The heroes they are many: but the times a-growin' slim, i
Hor now from Å tern to bow she's a blazin',
HO
The Yarmouth Castle's moanin', she's crying like a child,
You can hear it if you listen above the roar so wild.
Is she cryin' for the ones who lie within her molten sides, ;?
Or cryin' for herself, I'm a-wonderin',
But the living soon were rescued, the ones who live to tell,
And from the "Star" they watched her as she died there in the
swells,
Like a toy shin on a millpond, she burned all through the night,
And slipped 'neath the waves in the morning..
