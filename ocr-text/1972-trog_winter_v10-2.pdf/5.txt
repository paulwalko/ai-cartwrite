"A songbook, why for a songbook?"
Well, for years people have associated with the VPI
Grotto (among other things) the institution of the
"party on the mountain", the "speleo-seminar" the
"orgy" or what ever you want to call it. As we all
know, these get togethers, whether they be large or
small, in the rain or under clear skies, wouldn't
be complete without the guitars and banjos appearing
and the singing beginning. This special issue of the
Tech Troglodyte puts down on paper those songs that
one would most likely hear at a VPI songfest. Knowing
full well that there have been some left out and that
new songs will become popular, we hope to set the
precedence of every year or so, the Trog staff coming
out with a supplement to this issue as part of the
regular issues. So the next time you're in Blacksburg
bring your songbook and join in with some of the best
caving fellowship around.,
I'd especially like to thank Jean Mccarthy for her
work as "Illusical editor" and all the other people who
contributed words, chords and their time and patience.
