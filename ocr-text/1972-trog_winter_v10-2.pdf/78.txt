THEY AIN'T GONNA CAVE NO MORE
Iů a dark and dreary cavern on a cold winter's day,
He made the great mistake that t&ok his life away,
He should have been more careful but instead he chose to play,
And he aPhi't gonna cáve no more.
GÔRY, GORY, WHAT A HELL OF A WAY TO DIE,
GØRY, GORY, WHAT A HẾLL OF A WAY TO DIE,
GORY, GORY, WHAT A HELL OF A WAY TO DIE,
AND HE AIN'T GONNA CAVE NO MORE.
"Can you make it to the high ledge?" called the belayer from below.
Our hero feebly answered"Yes" and upward inched on slow.
He w.as trying to drive a bolt in when his hold began to go,
And he ain"t gonna cave no more.
He shot right down the chimney and he quickly gathered speed;
He shot past his belayer who'd forgot the climber's creed;
An anchor to rock would have been all he'd ever need,
And he ain't gonna cave no more.
The belayer felt the rope pull taut, and tried to let it run;
But it jerked him from position, and he knew that he was done.
He left the ledge behind him and he couldn't help it none,
And they ain't gonna cave no more.
They sped on down the chimney that was so very tall,
The pit it was so fearful deep it made a glorious fall;
They slithered over a friction pitch and sped on down the wall,
And they ain't gonna cave no more..
The days they'd lived and loved and laughed kept running thru their min
They thought about the girls back home, the ones they'd left behind;
They thought about their comrades, too, and wondered what they'd find,
And they ain't gonna cave no more..
One had the rope about his neck, formations through his spleen;
The other had no hard hat, so of course he split his bean;
The trails of red marked their descent as they make the final scene;
And they ain't gonna cave no more,
They hit the floor, the sound was splat, the blood went spurting high;
Their comrades they were heard to say, "What a colorful way to die?"
And as they lay there one was heard to make his final sigh,
And they ain't gonna cave no more.
There was blood upon the cave packs, athere were brains upon the rope;
Intestines were entwined across the rough and rocky slope;
We coured them in a Gurnee can while coiling up the rope,
And we ain't gonna cave no more!
