There was a time in this fajr land when the railroad did not run
When the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun
Löng before the white inan and long before the wheel
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real.
But time has no beginnings and history has no bounds
As to this verdant country they came from all around
They sailed upon her waterways, and walked her forests tall
Built the inines, the mills, and the factories for the good of us al:
And when a young man's fancy was turning to the spring
The railroad men grew restless for to hear the hammers ring
Their minds were overflowing with the yisions of their day
And many a fortune lost and won, and many a debt to pay.

For they looked to the future and what did they see
They sav en iron road running froin the sea to the sea
Bringing the goods to a young growing land
All up from the seaports and into their hands
Look away said they across this mighty land
From the eastern shore to the western strand.

Bring in the workers and bring up the rails
We gotta lay down the tracks and tear up the trails
oßen your hearts and let the lifeblood flow
We gotta get on our way cause were moving too slow
Repeat 1-4
Get on our way cause we're moving too slow.
Behind the Blue Rockies the sun is decling
The stars they come stelling at the close of the dây
Across the wide prairies our loved ones lie sleeping
Beyond the dark ocean in a place. far away..
