Frankie and Johnny were lovers,
Oh Lordy, how they could love,
C
Their love 'was true as the moon and stars
That shined in the heavens above,
A7 D7
Cause she loved his wingding and his doodlydo,
Frankie went down to the barroom,
She ordered a gallon of beer.
She asked the fat bartender,
"Has my. lovin' Johnny been here?".
Cause she loved his wingding and his doodlydo.
The bartender told her no story,
The bartender told her no lie.
He said Johnny was in the backroom
A fingerin' Lilly Bly,
Cause she loved his wingding and his doodlydo.
Frankie then reached into her purse
And pulled out an old 44,
She aimed it straight at the ceiling
And blew the bartender's ass on the floor,
Cause she loved his wingding and his doodlydo,
Frankie busted in on Johnny,
And took him by alarm.
He wasn't using his finger,
He was using his whole damn arm,
Cause she loved his wingding and his doodlydo.
The first shot got him in the shoulder,
The second shot got him as he fell,
The third shot, ladies and gentlement,
Tore his left ball all to hell,
Cause she loved his wingding and what was left of his doodlydo.
So the moral of this story
I'll tell right now to you,
If you've got a jealous girlfriend,
Be careful what you do,
Or she'11 shoot off your wingding and most of your doodlydo.
