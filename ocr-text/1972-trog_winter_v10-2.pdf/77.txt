Along about-éighteen and twenty-five
Am
I left Tennessee very much alive
с
I never would have gotten through the Arkansas mud,
7
If I hadn't been riding on a Tennessee. Stud.
I had some trouble with my sweetheart's pa,
And one of her brothers was a bad outlaw,
I sent her a letter by my Uncle Bud,
And I rode away on the Tennessee Stud.

TENNESSEE STUD WAS LONG AND LEAN

THE COLOR OF THE SUN AND HIS EYES WERE GREEN,

HE HAD THE NERVE AND HE HAD THE BLOOD,

AND THERE NEVER WAS A HORSE LIKE THE TENNESSEE STUD.

We rode on down into no-man's land,
We crossed that river called the Rio Grande,
I raced my stallion with a Spaniard's fold,
Til I got me a skin full of silver and gold.

Me and the gambler, we couldn't agree,
We got in a fight over Tennessee
We jerked our guns, and he fell with a thud,
And I got away on a Tennessee Stud.
REFRAIN
Well I got just as lonesome as a man can be,
A dreamin' of my girl back in Tennessee.
Tennessee Stud's green eyes turned blue,
Cause he was thinkin' 'bout his Sweetheart, too.
EO
We loped right back across Arkansas,
I whipped her brother and I whipped her pa,
I found that girl with the golden hair,
And she was riding on a Tennessee Mare.
REFRAIN
Stirrup to stirrup and side by side,
We crossed the mountains and the valleys wide.
We came to. Big Muddy and we forded the flood,
On the Tennessee Mare and the Tennessee Stud,
Pretty little baby on the cabin floor,
Little horse colt playing 'round the door.
I love that girl with the golden hair,
And the Tennessee Stud loves the Tennessee Mare,
REFRAIN
