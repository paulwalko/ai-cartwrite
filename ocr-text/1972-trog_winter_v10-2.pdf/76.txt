TE A CH: YOUR CHILDREN
Y&u, who are on the road, must have a code
That you can live by
And so, become yourself, because the past
Is just a goodbye,
Teach your children well, their father's hell
Vill slowly go by
And feed, them on your dreams, the one they picks
The one you'll know by.
DON'T YOU EVER ASK THELI WHY
IF THEY TOLD YOU, YOU WOULD CRY
JUST LOOK AT THEM AND SIGH
AND KNOW THEY LOVE YOU.
And you, of the tender years, can't know the fears
That your elders grew by:
And so, help them with your youth, they seek the truth
Before they can die,
Teach your parents viell, their childrens hell
Will slowly go: by !.. ..:
And feed; them on your 'dreams, the one they picks
The one you'll know by.
