Build your fire with hickory,
Hickory, ash or oak,
Don't use no green or rotten wood,
Or they'll catch you by the „smoke.
My daddy he made whiskey,
My grand daddy, did too.
And we ain't paid no whiskey tax,
Since seventeen-ninety-two.
Get you a copper quarter,
Get you a copper dime,
Just like the man who made them,
They'll be gone by sixty-nine.
