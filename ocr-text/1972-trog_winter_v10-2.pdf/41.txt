When I was just a little baby
My mama said " Hey, son,
Travel where you will and grow to be a man,
And sing what must be sung, oh yeah
Sing what must be sung"

Now that I'm a grown man
I've traveled here and there
I've learned that a bottle of brandy and a song
Are the only ones who ever care, Oh yeah
The only ones who ever care.
