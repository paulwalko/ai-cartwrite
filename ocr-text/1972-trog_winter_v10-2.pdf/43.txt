There is a house in this old town,
And that's where my true love lays arolina,
And he takes other women down of his knee,
And he tells them that he never will tell me.
OH, IT'S HARD, AND IT'S HARD, AIN'T IT HÅRD,
TO LÕVE ONE THAT NEVER DID LOVE YOU,
IT'S HARD,. AND IT'S_HARD, AIN'T IT_FÅRD, GREAT GOD,
TO LOVE. ONE THAT NEVER COULD BE TRUE.
First time I saw my true love,
He was walkin' by ny door,
Last time I seen his false-hearted smile,
He was dead on the barroom floor.

Who's goin' to kiss your ruby lips,
And who's goin! to hold you to their breast,
And who's goin' to talk your future over,
While I am ramblin' in the West?"
Don't go to drinkin' and gamblin',
Don't go there your sorrows to drown,
That hard-liquor place is a' low-down disgrace,
It's the meanest damn place in this town.
