BANKS OF THE OHIO
A
SA
I asked my love to take a wall,
To take a walk, just a little mali.
Dom beside where the waters flow,
Down by the banks of the Ohio,
AND ONLY SAY, THAT YOU"LL BE TINE,
3) I:10 03:25 AS 1913
DOYN BESIDE THIRD THE ZATERS FLOW,
DOWN BY 173 BANKS OF THE OHIO. :
I held a linife against her 'breast,
As into my arms she presseca
She cried, "Oh 7illie, don't murder me,
I'm not prepared for eternity."
I started liome' 'tween twelve, and one, ;
I cried, "ily God, that have I done?
Killed the only toman I loved,. .
Because she would not be my bride."
