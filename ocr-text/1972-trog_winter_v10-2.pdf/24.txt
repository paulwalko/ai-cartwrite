CROOK â˜º HANK'S C i V E
I hear that river flowin',
It's flowin' round the bend,
And I ain't seen the sunshine,
: 67
Since I don't know when.
Well I'm stuck in Crookshank's Cave,
And time keeps draggin' on,...
D
And that river keeps a flowin', ...
. GCG
On down to Charlston.
Well, when I was just a baby,
My daddy said one day,
"Don't go climb on mountains
Or mess around in caves."
Well' I was cavin' down in Blacksburg
To pass the time away..
How much longer must I stay here,
Maybe one more day.
Well I bet thery're back in Blacksburg,
Drivin' round in cars,
Eatin' in the messhall,
And smokin' big cigars,
Well I know I had it comin',
I know I can't be free,
And that river keeps arisin',
And that's what tortures me,
Well if I get out of here,
And I see that old sunshine,
You bet I'd move it on
A little farther down the line,
Far from Crookshank's Cave,
That's where I want to stay,
And I'd let that Greenbriar River
Wash all my blues away.
