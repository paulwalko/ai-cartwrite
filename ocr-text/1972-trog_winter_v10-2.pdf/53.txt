I took my harpoon out of my dirty rod bendang...
And was blovin' sad while Bobby sang the blues
With those windshield, wipers slappin' time and Bobby
clappin' hands 77

Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing ain't worth notking, but it's free
Feelin' good was easy Iord, when Bobby sang the blues
Foolin' good was good enough for the ..
good enough for ine and my Bobby Magee.
From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun

Bobby shared the secrets of_my." soúi"
Standing right boside me Löra, through everything I've done
Every night she kept me from the cold.
But somewhere near Salidas Lord, I lot her slip away
Searching for the home I'd heard she'd bought
And I'd give all my tomorrows for 2 single yesterdny
IIoldin' Bobby's body close to mine.
