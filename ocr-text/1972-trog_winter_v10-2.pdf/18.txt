Whilo sitting one day on the school yard gato,
Tho crossbar wont over the upright went in,
And evor since Charlotto's boon living in sin.

SHE'S CHARLOTTE, THE HARLOT, THE GIRL I ADORE,
D7
THE PRIDE OF THE PRAIRE THE COWPUNCHER'S WHORE.
She'll suck you, she'll fuck you, sho'll grow on your nuts,
Sho'll wrap hor logs round you and squeeze out your guts,
She squeeze you so hard that you'll wish you could die,
But I'd rathor oat Charlotto thon blueberry pio.
She's dirty, sho's vulgar, she spits in the street,
Whon over you moet hor sho's always in hoat.
Sho'll lay for a dollar, take loss or take moro,
The pride of tho prairie, : tho.cowpuncher's whore.
Way down on tho prairio whero cowshit is thick,
Whoro womon aro women and conboys come quick.
Thoro livos a young maidon, the girl I adore,
Tho pride of tho prairio, the cowpunchers whoro.
Ono day on the canyon, no pants on her skin,
A rattlosnako saw her and throw himsolf in.
Now Charlotto tho harlot givos cowboys a fright,
With the only vagina that rattles and bitos.
One day on tho prairio while riding along,
My feet in tho stirrups, my hands on my dong.
When who should I moot but the girl I adoro,
Tho pride of tho prairio, the cowpunchor's whoro.
Well I jumped from my saddlo and reached for her crack,
But tho damn thing was rattling and frightenod me back.
So I drow out my pistol and aimod for it's head,
But I missed tho damn rattlor and shot her instead.
Tho funeral procossion was forty milos long,
With a chorus of cowboys a-singing this song.
Horo lies a young maidon who novor kopt score,
She's a hot fucking, cock sucking, Moxican whoro,
Now Charlotto doar Charlotte lios doad in her tomb,
And maggots crawl out of hor decomposed womb.
But still on hor face is a brief cry for more,
Sho's a hot fucking, cock sucking, Moxican whoro,
