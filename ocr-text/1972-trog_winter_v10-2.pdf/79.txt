AND THERE WAS MOONSHINE, MOONSHINE, TO QUENCH THE DEVIL'S THTRST,
THE LAW THEY SWORE THEY'D GET HIM BUT THE DEVIL GOT HIM FIRST.

Somotimos into Ashvillo, somotimos Momphis town
Tho rovonuors chasod him, but thoy couldn't run him down
Each timo thoy thought they had him, his engino would explode
And he'd go by like they woro standing still on Thunder Road.
On tho first of April, nintoon fifty-four
A fodoral man sont word, ho'd bottor nako his run no moro
Ho said two hundred agonts wero covoring the state
Whichovor road ho tried to take, they'd got him suro as fate.
Son, his Daddy told hin, make this run your last
Your tank is fillod with hundred proof, you're all tunod up and gassod
Don't tako any chances if you can't got through
I'd rathor have you back again than all that mountain dow.
Roaring out of Harlan, roving up his mill
Ho shot the gap at Cumberland and scroamed past Maynardsvillo
With G-mon on his tail, high roadblocks up ahoad
Tho mountain boy took roads that ovon angols foar to troad.
Thoy played him right thru Knoxvillo, out to Kingston Piko
And right outside of Boarden, whoro they mako tho fatal strike
Ho loft tho road at ninoty, that's all there is to say
Tho dovíl got the moonshino, and the mountain boy that day,
