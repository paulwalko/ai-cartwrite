I shall tell of a hunter, whose life was undone.
By the cruel hand of evil at the setting of the sun
His arrow was loosed and it flew through the dark ,
And his true love was slain as the shaft found it's mark.

He ran up beside her and found it was she
He turned away his head for he could not bear to see
He lifted her up and found she was dead
A fountain of tears for his true love he shed,
He bore her away to his home by the sea
Cried father, oh father I've murdered poor Polly
I've killed ay poor love in the flower of her life
I'd always intended that she be my wife.
IIe roamed near the place where his true love was slain
And he vept bitter tears but his cries were all in vain
As he looked on the lake aswan glided by
And the sun slovly sank in the grey oỉ the night.
