CRAW D A D SONG
A7
Y:'u get a line and I'll get a pole, honey;
You get a line and I'll get ia, polÄ™, babe,
You get a line and I'll get a pole,
we'll go down to the crawdad hole,
Honey, sugar bady, mine.
Yonder is a man with a pack on his back,
Packin' all the crawdads he can pack
Get up old woman, you slept too late,
The crawdad man done passed your gate.
Get up old man, you: slept too late
There ain't no crawdads on your plate.
A-settin' on the ice till my feet got hot,
A-watchin' that crawdad rock and trot,
Crawdad, crawdad, you'd better go to hole,
If I don't catch you, damn my soul..
Whatcha gonna do when the lake runs dry?
Sit on the bank and watch the crawdads die,
Whatcha gonna do when your man goes away? .
Get me a better one very next day.
