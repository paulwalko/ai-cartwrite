Back with my wife in Tennessee, and one day she said to me,
"Virgil, quick come see, there goes Robert E. Lee."
Now I don't mind them chopping wood, and I don't care if the
money's no good,
Just take what you need and leave the rest,
But they should never have taken the very best,
REFRAIN
Like my father before me, I'm a working man,
And like my brother before me, I took a Rebel stand.
Well he was just 18, proud and brave, but a Yankee laid him in
his grave.
I swear by the blood below my feet
You can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeat.
REFRAIN
