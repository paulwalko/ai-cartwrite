Ribbon of darkness over me
Where once the world was young as spring
Where flowers did bloom and birds did sing
Ribbon of darkness over me
WHISTLE THE VERSE :
Here in this cold room lyin'
Don't want to see no one but you
Lord, I wish I could be dyin'
To forget you.
Oh, how I wish your heart could see
How mine just aches and breaks all day
Come on home and take away
This ribbon of darkness over me.
Come on home and take away
This ribbon of darkness over me .
