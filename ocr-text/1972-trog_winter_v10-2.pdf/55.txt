Yesterday's a memory, today is just a friend

All is well, as I swing up to the border bent for heil
And the service station man agreed I didn't look .too well
But the mountains and Maryann are calling out to me
And I got my bed roll on my back and everything that I could pack
To see me on my way::
All is well, I've made my peace and mån, I'm feelin' fine
And the losers that I left behind I'll think about some other time
For the border men were all my friends, they couldn't find a dime
And the prairie towns go säilin' by, saskachuwan there's müd in

I'm leavin' you behind..
There'll be hot-blooded mountain love to satisfy my soul
And the red pines_will bow their heads, the rivers and the water-
sheds will carry us along :
For the mountains and Maryann will greet me there as only she can
