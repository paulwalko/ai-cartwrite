HI
I H E HO USE OF THE R I S I N G SUN
Th&18 2 hoúsg in New Orleans
Thoy chll the Rising sün
Ana it's been the rúin of many a poor girı
And 48, I know I'm che
My mother sho's ataylor
She sews those now blue jeans
lly father was a gambling man
Down in New Orleans,
If I had listened to what inang said
I'd be at home today
But being young and foolish, poor girl
Lot a gamblor load no astray.
The only thing drunkard needs
Is a suitcase and = trunk
And the only time that he is .satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk.
Helll fill his glasses to the brim
He passes them around
And the only pleasure he gets out of life
Is bumming from town to town.
Go toll my baby sister
Not to do what I have done
TO shun that house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun.
It's one foot on the platform
And the other on the train
I'm going back to New Orleans
TO woar that ball and chain.
I'in going back to Nov Orloans
Tiy race is almost run
I'm going back to spend my lifo
Beneath that Rising Sun.
