Em
nii my bags are packed, I'm ready to go
I'm standing here, outside your door
I hâte to wake you thing to say goodbye.
But the dawn is broaking it's carly morn
The, taxi's waiting, he's blowing his horn
Already I'm so lonësono I could dic.
so KİSS IC AND SHILE FOR ME .
TELL ME THAT YOU'LL WAIT FOR ME
HØLD ME LIKE YOU'LL NEVER LIT LIE GO.
CAUSE I'M LEAVING, ON A JET PLANE:
DON'T KNOW WHEN I'LL BE BACK AGAIN.
OH, BABE, I HATE TO GO.
Em
There's so many times I've let you down
So many timos I've played around
I tell you now that they don't incan a thing.
Every place I go I'll think of you
Every song I sing I'll sing for you
When I come back I'll vicar your wedding ring.
Now the time has come to leavo you
One more time let me kiss you
Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way.
Dream about the days to como
When I won't have to leave alone
About the times I won't have to say.
