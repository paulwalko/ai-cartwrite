Well, it's four o'clock in the afternoon, the anchors have
been weighed,
From Miañi to Našsau, she's bound across the waves.
She's headin' south thru Biscayne bay itito the open sea,
Yarmouth Castle she's edýin' and don't know it.
Am
Now the many years she's been to see, she's seen the better
times,
She gives her groan of protest as they cast away the lines,
Now the rumble:of her engines and the rust along lier spine,
Tell the Castle sho's too old to be sailing..
But the sounds run out rithin hör ihoärt; a tiny spark glows
red,
It smolders through the evening there's laughter overhead,
The dinners' served, the cards are delt, and the drinks are
passed around,
And deep within the fire starts a-burnin'.
Now it's midnight on the open sea, the moon is shining bright,
Some people join the party and others say goodnight.
There's any who are sleeping now, it's been a busy day,
And a tiny wis? of smoke is a-risin'.
Oh Lord" she groans, "I'in burning, let someone understand."
But her silent plea is wasted in the playing of the band.
Everybody's dancing on the deck and having such a time;
And a voice says "Shut up and deal, I'm losing."
ogins to end grows burns
Deep within the Yarmouth Castle, the fire begins to glow,
It leaps into the hallways and climbs and twists and grows.
The paint she wore to keep her young, Oh Lord how well it burns,
And soon that old fire is a-ragin'.
Beneath the bridge it's climbing fast, the captain stands aloft,
He calls up to the bosin, says "Bosin we are lost."
For the ragged hoses in the racks no pressure do they hold,
And the people down below will soon be dyin'.
Amidships oh she's blazin' now it's spreadin' fore and aft,
And the people are 2-scramblin' as the fire blocks their path..!
The evil smoke surrounds them now, and they're falling in their
tracks,
And the captain in his lifeboat, is a-leavin'.
