BOSS II A N
Boss man, boss man, what do you say,
I gotta get you alone in a mine someday.
Boss man, boss man, turn it around,
I f you don't look away how can I sit down.'
HH
Look at this load upon my back,
Gonna get this wheel back on the track.
I can't hold on but I can't let go,
I can't say yes, I can't say no.
Holes in my pockets and holes in my shoes,
If you're ready for ac, I'm ready for you.
The company plan tales all my pay,
Got a child in July and another last May.
Boss man, boss man, what do you say,
Gotta get you alone in a mine someday.
Push your face coven in the coal,
'Cause you got no heart, you sot no soul.
Country life's the life for me,
In ten more years I'll a pensioner be.
The young lad knows when the girls are out,
You might say he's & rural sprout.
Boss an, boss man, what do you say,
Gotta get you alone in the mize Someday.
Boss man, boss man, clear the track,
You're gonna toar the skin right off my back,
Boss man, boss man, what do you say,
If you can't lend a hand, then get out of my way.
It'll be murder in the first degree,
If you ever lay your hands on me.
Boss man, boss mozi, pay my rent,
'Cause a dollar. I've earned is Ã¤ dollar I've spent.
The company plan takes all my check,
For brcaliing ry bacle and breaking my neck.
Boss, man, boss man, what do you say,
Gotta get you alone in the mind someday.
I can't hold on, but I can't let go,
I can't say yes, I can't say no,
SHA
