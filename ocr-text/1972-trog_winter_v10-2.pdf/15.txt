We are the navvies who work upon the railroad
Swinging our hammers in the bright blazing sun
Living on stew, and drinking, bad whiſkey
Bending our backs til the long days are done.
Repeat 1&2
Laying down track and buiſaing un briãges
Bending our bačks til the railroad is done.:

So it's over the mountains and over the plains
Into the luskee and into the rain
Up the St, Lawrence all the way to Gaspee
Swinging our hammers and drawing our pay.

Them
Laying, 'em in and thing 'em down
Then off to the bunlchouse and into the town
A dollar a day and a place for my head
A drink to the living a toast to the dead.

on the song of the future has been súng
All the battles have been wron
On the mountain tops westend
All the world at our command:
We have onened up the soil
With our teardrops; and our tớil.
on there was a time in this fair land when the railroad did notrun
When the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun
Long before the white man and long before the wheel
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real.
When the green dark forost was too silent to be real,
And many are the coad men -------- too silent to be real.
