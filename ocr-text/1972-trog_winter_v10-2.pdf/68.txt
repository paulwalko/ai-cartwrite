Another old lady was Annabelle Draper
She left a trail of wet toilet pa per
In hope that some one would follow and rape her
And nobody knew she was there.
Another old lady was Elizabeth Brewster
She sat and she sat and she sat like a rooster
Till Father Neptune came up and goosed her
And nobody knew she was there.
Another old lady was Elizabeth Bickle
She vaulted the door for want of a nickle
One foot in the bowl, it sure was a pickle
And nobody knew she was there.
Annther old lady was Hilda Guardercrandle
She sat and she sat and she pulled on the handle
And all that was left was a water-soaked sandle
And nobody knew she was there.
