DRAF I DODGE R R Ã€ G

Well, I'm just a typical American boy from a typical American town,
D7
I believe in God and Sen. Dodd and keeping old Castro down,
G
:
And when it came my serve I knew better dead than Red.
But when I got to my old draft board, buddy, this is what I said.
G.
SARGE, I'M ONLY 18, GOT A RUPTURED SPLEEN, AND I ALWAYS CARRY A PURSE,
I GOT EYES LIKE A BAT, MY FEET ARE FLAT, MY ASTHMA 'S GETTING WORSE.
THINK OF MY CAREER, MY SWEETHEART DEAR, MY POOR OLD INVALID AUNT,
BESIDES I AIN'T NO FOOL I'M AGOIN' TO SCHOOL AND I'M WORKIN'IN A
DEFENSE PLANT.
I got a dislocated disk and a racked up back I'm allergic to flowers
and bugs,
When the bombshell hits I get epileptic fits and I'm addicted to a
thousand drugs,
I got weakness woes can't touch my toes. I can hardly reach my knees,
And when the enemy gets close to me I'll probably start to sneeze.
Well, Chou Enlai, I hope he dies, there's one thing you got to see,
That some one's got to go over there, but that some one isn't me.
So I wish you well, Sarge, give 'em hell, kill me a thousand or so,
And if you ever get a war wihtout blood and gore, I'll be the first
to go.
