THIS IS THE WORST TRIP I'VE EVER BEEN ON.
The first mate he got árunk;
Broke up the people's trunks,
Constable had to come
Take him away.
Sheriff John Strom,
Why don't you let me alone,
Well I feel so breakup
I wanna go home.

Well the poor cook he got the. fits,
Threw away all the grits,
Then he took and ate up
All of my corn.
Let me go home ,
I wanna go home,
This is the worst trip
Since I've been born.
