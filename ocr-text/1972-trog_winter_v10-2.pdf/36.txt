FOI SOM P R IS ON
G7
Well I hear the train a'comin',
It's rollin' round the bend,
An' I ain't seen the sunshine,
Since I don't know when.
I'm stuck in Tolsom Prison,
And time keeps draggin' on,
But that train it. keeps a'rollin',
On down to San Antone.

When I was just a baby,
My mother told me, "Son,
Always be a good boy,
Don't ever play with guns."
Well I shot a man in Reno,
Just to watch hin die,
An' when I hear that lonesome whistle,
I hang my head and cry.
I bet there's rich folks eatin',
On a fancy dinin' car,
They're probly drinkin' coffee,
And smokin' big cigars.
Well I linov I had it comin',
I know I can't be free,
But that train lees a-movin',
And that's what tortures ne.
Well if I get out of here,
And that railroad train was mine,
You bet I'd nove it on,
A little farther down the line.
Oh, far from Folsom Prison,
That's where I want to stay,
And I'd let that lonesome whistle,
Blow all my blues away.
