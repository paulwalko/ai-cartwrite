We were standin' on tihe bank ong cula frustymraning i
Just watchin' the steam from holow
It was comin' from the stack of the oỉd 97
The pride of the oía soulihorn Road.
Well they gave him his orders in Monroe, Virginia
Sayin' Steve you're way behind time
This is not 38 but its old 97
antta put herinto Spencer on time.
Well he turned around and said to his black greasy fireman
Gotta shovel on a little more coal
And when we reach tzat White Oali Mountain
You'll see old 97 roll. :
But it's a long hard road from Lynchburg to Danville
And it's all on a three mile grade
It was on this grado that he lost his airbrakes
You should see what a jump he mado.
He was goin' down the track doin' 90 miles an inour
When his whistle broke into a scream
He was found in the wreckage with his hand on the throttle
He'd been scalded to death by the steam.
A telegram came into Vashington Station
And this is the way it read
"The brave engineer of the old 97,
Is lying in Danville dead."
Now all you ladies take heed and take warnin'
From this day on and on
Never speak harsh words to your true lovin' husband
He may leave you and never return.
