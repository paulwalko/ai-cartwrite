Come air you young fellows so bold and so fine
And seek not your fortune way down in the mine
It'li form like a habit, seep in your soul
'Til the stream of your blood is as black as the coal.
- 37 --
DARK AS! IE DUNGEON AND DAMP AS THE DEW
WHERE THE DANGER IS DOUBLED AND THE PLEASURES ARE FEW
WHERE THE RAIN NEVER FALLS, THE SUN NEVER SHINES
IT'S DARK AS THE DUNGEON WAY DOWN IN THE MINE.
Oh it's many a man I've seen in my day:
Who lived just to labor his whole life away
Like a fiend with his dope, or a drunk with his wine
A man nust have lust for the lure of the mines.
I hope when I'm gone, the ages do roll
riy body may blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home
And pity that miner a digging my bones. ..
Way down in the mines,
