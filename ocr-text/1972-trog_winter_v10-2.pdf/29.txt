It ain't no use to eat and wonder wan Babe,
It don't matter anyhow.
on it ain't no uso to sit and wonder why Babe,
If you don't know by novio
ven the rooster crows at the freak of dam,
Igolo out your window and I'll be gone,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Don't think twice, it's alright.
It ain't no use in turning on your light Babe,
That light I never knowed.
Oh it ain't no use in turning on your light Babe,
I'm on the dark side oỉ the road.
Still I wish there was something you could do or say,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
We never did too much talking anyway,
So don't think twice, it's alright.
I'm walking, con this long and lonesome road Babe,
Where I'm bound. I can't tell,
But goodbye is too good 2 ford gal,
So I'll just say fare thee well.
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
You could have done better, but I don't mind,
You just kind oÏ wasted my precious time,
Don't think twice, it's alright,

It ain't no use in calling out iny naino gal,
Like you never did before,
It ain't no use in calling out my name gal,
I can't hear you anymore.
I'm 2-thinking and a-wondering all the way down the roac,
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told,
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul,
But don't think twice, it's alright.
