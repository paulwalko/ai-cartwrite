'Twas early in the morning 'twix the hours of six and seven
The guards were standing round me in numbers odd and even
I reached for my pistols but alas I was mistaken
My pistols would not fire and prisoner I was taken.
They put me in the jail without judge or writin'
For robbin' Colonel Pepper up on Gillgara Mountain
But they didn't take my fists so I knocked the sentry down
And bid a glad farewell to that jail in Sligo town,
My brother Farrell, he's the one who's in the army
But I don't know where he's at, be it Cork or in Killarny
Together we'll go roamin' O'er the mountains of Kil Kenny
I swear he'll treat me fairer than my darlin', sportin' Jenny.
Twas early in the mornin' at the barracks of Killarny
My brother took his leave but he didn't tell the army
Our horses they were speedy, 'twas all over save the shoutin'
Now we wait for Pepper up on Gillgara Mountain.
Some people take delight in the fishin' and the bowlin'
Others take delight in the carriage atrollin!
But I take delight in the fruits of the Bady "
And courtin' pretty ladies in the morning so early!
