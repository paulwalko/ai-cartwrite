There's snow on the mountains, the pitons are rusting,

The ropes are all coiled and hung on the wall,
We're all going back to the grime of the city,
To save up our money and go climb again.
SO GOOD BYE TO MY HANDHOLD, FAREWELL TO MY FOOTHOLD,
ADIOS TO THE CLIFF FACE, QUE COME THE PITONS .

YOU WONT 'T BE ALIVE WHEN YOU REACH THE BIG GLACIER,

YOU'LL NEVER BE RESCUED, YOU NEVER SIGNED OUT.
My father's own father climbed mountains with Whymper,
My father still hangs on the Eiger's north wall.
My brothers and sister, they climb in your mountains,
They climb up your cliffs til they peel off and fall,

Is this the best way we can climb in the Tetons,
Is this the best way we can make our ascent,
To fall and to rot like dry leaves on your glaciers
And never be rescued by no climber's card?
REFRAIN
Some of us are dirty and some are unshaven,
Our thirty days are up and we have to move out,
The ranger is waiting to catch us for speeding,
And exhibit our bodies in the Ranger Museum.
REFRAIN
