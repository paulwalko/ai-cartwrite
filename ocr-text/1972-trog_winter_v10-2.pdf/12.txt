SEARCHING FOR HIS MASTER WHO IS LONG, LONG, GONE.
In the days of the old covered wagons,
When they camped on the flats for the night,
With the stars growing dim,
on that old highboard rim,
They would watch for those brown mountain lights.
Long years ago a southern planter,
Came hunting in these wild lands alone,
And it's here, so they say,
The hunter lost his way,
And he never returned to his home.
A trusty old slave brought a lantern,
And he searched but in vain, day and night,
The old slave is gone,
But his spirit wanders on,
And the old lantern still casts its light.
