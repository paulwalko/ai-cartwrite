And then she floppod upon her knoos and started in to pray,
Ploaso Lord, she said, it's thirty yoars I'vo waitod for this day,
Still I wont about the frigging town to hoal tho frigging lamo,
But evory time I raisod thon ipz thoy got knocked down again,
Now tho good lord sonds his blessings down in a frigging curious way,
But when he's marked a won for loro, that lovo is hero to stay,
But the way you'vo got to use thai lovo is a frigging quoor affair,
There ain't no uso in raising stiffa, choro ain't no use in prayor,
And this I know bocauso I'vo got an ovor flowing sign,
For evory time I wash my hoad tho wator turns to wino,
And I givo it froe to working folks to brighton thoir poor lives,
So they won't kick no dogs around, or boat up on thoir wivos.
For thoro ain't no point to miraclos liko walking on tho sea,
Thoy crucifiod tho con e: God, but thoy don't mess with mo.
For I 1718.70 the fricairs blind aler:og and the dying and the doad,
But CTCITI day at ! 300K, Iw3ch my frigging hoad,
