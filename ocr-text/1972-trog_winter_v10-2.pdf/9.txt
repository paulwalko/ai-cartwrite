B L I YDED BY TURDS
PT
. G7
There was an old lady who lived on my street,
G7
Whose passage was blocked from too much to eat.
She took stomach pills without reading the box,
And before she could strip, turds .were flying like rocks,
TOO-RA-LAH, TOO-RA-LAY
A ROLLINGSTONE GATHERS NO LOSS, SO THEY SAY
SING ALONG WITH THE BIRDS
G7 .
IT'S A WONDERFUL SONG, BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT TURDS,

She ran to the window and stuck out her ass,
And just at that moment a caver walked past.
He heard a strange noise and he gazed up on high,
And a bloody big turd hit him right in the eye.
REFRAIN
He ran to the east and he ran to the west,
When a further consignment arrived on his chest.
He fled to the north and he fled to the south
And a mighty big turd hit him right in the mouth,
REFRAIN
The next time you pass over New River Bridge,
Look out for the caver, asleep on the ridge.
His chest bears a placard, which on are these words:
"Be kind to the caver who's blinded by turds!".
REFRAIN
