LONG BLACK V E IL

Ten years ago on a cold dark night,
Soineone was killed 'neath the Town Hall light
2?:cre ere for at the scene, but they all acreed
That the sleyor who ran looked al√≤t like me.
She walls those hifis in a long black veil,
Visits my grave when the night winds wail,
Nobody Imoys, nobody sees,
Nobody knovs but ne.
The judge said, "Son, what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die."
I spolc not a word, though it reant my life,
For I'd been in the arms of ny best friends wife.
She walks those hills in a long black veil,
Visits my cravo when the night winds vail,
ITobody knows, nobody sees,
Nobody knows but me.
The scaffold is high, eternity near,
She stands in the crowd, she sheds not a tear.
But sometimes at night, when the cold winds moan,
In a long black veil she cries over my bones.
She walls these hills ...
