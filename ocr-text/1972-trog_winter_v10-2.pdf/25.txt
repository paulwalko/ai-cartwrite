When first I did appear upon this native soil
Am7
Dm
All up and down this country' at labor I did toil.
Am7
I slumbered in the moonlight and I rose with the sun.
Am7
Dm
I rambled through the canyons where the cold rivers run.
Dm
When first I did come down where the land meets the sea
The people said, "Who are you and what would your name be?"
I aaid, "I have no home and I am no man's son.
'T'was inland I was born and from inland that I come.

IN THE GOOD LAND I WAS YOUNG AND I WAS STRONG.

NO ONE DARED TO CALL ME "SON"

HAPPY JUST TO SEE MY DAYS WORK DONE,
Am7
Dm
SEE MY DAYS WORK DONE
So I swung an axe as a timberjack and I worked the Quebec mines
And on the golden prairie I rode the big combines.
I sailed the maritime water of many a seaport town,
Took the highways and the byways to the western salmon ground.
I've gazed upon the good times and I've seen the bad times too,
Felt many a cold and bitter wind and many a morning dew.
I've watched the country growin' like a fair and mighty thing
And in the still of a summer night I've heard the mountains ring
REFRAIN
But now the seeds are planted and the gates are open wide.
The old ways are forgotten, there's no place left to hide,
And the legacy I'm leavin' you's not very hard to find,
You'll see it all around you at the crossroads of time.
Am7
Dm
In the sweet soil it's a-growin' at the crossroads of time,
