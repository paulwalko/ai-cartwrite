There is a young cowboy, he lives on the range .

His horse and his cattle are his only companions.

He works in the saddle and he sleeps in the canyons

Waiting for summer his pastures to change.

And as the moon rises, he sits by his fire,
Em

Thinking about women and glasses of beer,

And closes his eyes as the doggies retire.

He sings out a song which is soft, but it's clear
с
As if maybe some one could hear.

HE SAYS, " GOODNIGHT YOU MOONLIGHT LADIES
Em
ROCK-A-BYE SWEET BABY JAMES
Em
DEEP GREENS AND BLUES ARE THE COLORS I CHOOSE,
D
WON'T YOU LET ME GO DOWN IN MY DREAMS
D
SO ROCK-A-BYE SWEET BABY JAMES."
The first day of December was covered with snow
So was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston.
Those Berkshires seemed dream-like on account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go.
There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway,
A song that they sing when they take to the sea.
A song that they sing of their home in the sky,
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep.
