Håy out that thoy've got a nåtte,
For rốin and yana and fire.com
Tho ráin ig Toes, the tiro sore,
And they can the wiha Nafich.
infine bote the stars agona,
and sets the clouds 2-f1ģin'.
ketish poets tho mountains goma,
Like folks was off thore dyin',
MALATI, MATAH, THEY CALL THE WIND MARIAH.
as
Before I know liariah's name,
I heard her wail and whining.
I had 2 cl and she had me,
And the sun was always shining.
But then one day I loſt my gal,
I left her far behind me. ....
And now I'm lost, so coll-dorn lost,
ITO C even God can find me; . .
Way out west they've got a nome,
For rain and fire only.
But when you're lost and all alone,
There ain't no nano for lonely.
Well I'm a lost and lonlcy soul,
Without a star to guide me.
Mariah blow my love to re,
I need that gal beside me.
