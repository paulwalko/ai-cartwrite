And the old man came home from the forest,
His tears fell on the sidewalk as he stumbled in the street,
A dozen faces stopped to stare but no one stopped to speak,
For his castle was a hallway, and a bottle was his friend
And the old man stumbled in from the foresti
Up a dark and dingy staircase the old man made his way,
His ragged coat around him as upon his cot he lay,
And he wondered how it happened,
Getting lost like a fool in the forest.
And as he lay there sleeping a vision did appear,
Upon the mantle shining? the face of one so dear
Who'd loved him in the springtime of a long forgotten year
When the wildflow√≤rs did bloom in the forest,
She touched his grizzled fingers and she called him by his nam
And he heard the joyful sound of children at their games
In a farm house on a hillside in some forgotten town
Where the river runs down from the forest,
With a mighty roar the big jet soars above the canyon streets
And the con men con but life goes on for the city never sleeps
And to an old forgotten soldier the dawn will come no more
For the old man has come home from the forest.
