S IT DOWN YOUNG STRANGER
I'm standing at the doorway, my head down in my hands
I!ot knowing where to sit, not knowing where I ständ
lly father looms above me, for him there is no rest
My mother's arms enfold me and hold me to her breast.
You say you've been out wandering, they say you have gone far
Sit down young stranger and tell us who you are
The room has all gone misty, my thoughts are all a-spin
Sit down young stranger and tell us where you been.
Well I've been out to the mountain, I've walked down by the sea
I never questioned no one, and no one questioned me.
My love was given freely, and oft-times was returned
I ICVOI came to borrow, I only come to learn.
Sometimes it did get lonely, but it taught me how to cry
and laughter came too easy for life to pass me by
I never had a dollar that I didn't carn with pride
'Cause I had a million daydreams to keep me satisfied.
And will you sather daydreams or will you gather voalth
How can you find you fortune when you cannot find yourself
My mother's cyes grow misty, there's a trembling in her hand,
Sit down young stranger, I do not understand.
And will you try and tell us you've been too long at school
That knowledge is not needed, that power does not rule
That war is not the answer, that young men should not die
Sit down young stranger, I'll wait for your reply.
The answer is not easy, for souls are not reborn
To wear the crown of peaco you must wear the crown of thorns
If Jesus had a reason, I'm sure he would not tell
They treated him so basley, how could he wish them well?
Well, the palor now is empty, there's nothing left to say
Iły father has departed, my mother's gone to pray
There's rockets in the meadow and ships out on the sea
The answer's in the forest, carved upon a trec:
John loves llary, does anyone love me??
