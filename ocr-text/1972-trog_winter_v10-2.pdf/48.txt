He sees the children jumping off
At stations - one by one,
His woman and his best friend
In bed and having fun.
Crawling down the corridor
On his hands and knees
old Charlie stole the handle and
The train won't stop going
No way to slow down,
He hears the silence howling,
Catches angels as they fall.
And the all time winner
Has got him by the balls.
He picks up Gideon's Bible,
Open at page' one,
oid Charlie stole the handle and
The train won't stop going
No way to slow down.
