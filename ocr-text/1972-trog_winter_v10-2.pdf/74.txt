Well I got my mail last night
A. letter from a girl who_found the time to write
To her lonesome boy somewhere's in the night
She sent me a railroad ticket too
To take me to her loving arms
And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love.
Ar
Well I been out here many long days
I haven't found a place that I could call my own
Not a two bit bed to lay my body on
I been stood up, I been shook down
I been dragged into the sand
And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love.
Well I been up tight most every night
Walking along the strects of this old town
Not a friend around to tell ny troubles to
My good old car, she done broke down
Cause I drove it into the ground
And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love.
Well I look over yonder across the plain
A big drive wheels a-poundin' long the ground
Gonna get on board and I'll be homeward bound
Now I ain't had a home-cooked meal
And Lord, I need one now
And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love.
Now here I am with my hat in my hand
Standing on the road -- will you give me a ride?
To a lonesome boy who missed his train last night
I went into town2 for one last round
And I gambled my ticket avay
And the big steel rail won't carry me home to the one I love.
