In the protein of Springhill, ella scofia
Down in the dark of the Cumber
There's blond on the command the minor's Hill
In roads that never saw sum nor sky
In roads that nevor saw sun nor sky.

In the town of Springhill they don't lie easy
Often the ground may tremble and roll
When the earth is restless; minors die
Blood and bone is the price of coal .
Blood and bone is the price of coal.

In the town of Springhill, Nova Scotia
Late in the year of fifty-ciglit
The day still comes and the sun still shines
But it's dark as a greve in the Cumberland mine
But it's dark as a grave in the Cumberland nine.
.
.
Down at the coal face minor's are working
Rattle of the belt and the cutter's blade
The earth dic tremble and the walls came down
The living and the dead inen tio miles down
The living and the dead men tro miles down.
Twelve men lay two miles from the pit shaft
Twelve non lay in the darlo and sang :
Long hot days in a miner's tomb
Three foot high and a hundred long
Three feet high and a hundred long.
Three days passed and the lamus gave out
Caleb Rushton he u? and said
We've no more light nor water nor brond
We'll livo on hope and songs instead
We'll live on hope and songs instead.
Listen for the shouts of the black-faced niners
Listen for the drilling of the rescue team
10,000 foot of coal and slag :
Hope imprisioned in three foot seam
Hope imprisioned in a three foot seein.
Light days passed and some woro rescued
Leaving the dead to lie alone
Through all their lives they dug their graves
Iwo miles of earth for a marling stone
Two miles of earth for a marking stone.
