I know a place 'bout a mile down the road
D7
where you can lay down a dollar or two
If you hush up your mug, they will slip you a jug:
Of that good ole mountain don...
THEY CALL IT THAT GOOD OLD MOUNTA IN DEW, DEW, DEW
AND THEM THAT REFUSE IT ARE FEW
BUT I'LL HUSH UP MY IIUG, IF YOU'LL FILL UP LIY JUG
WITH THAT GOOD OLD MOUITTAIN DEW.
What can compare with the fragrance so rare
Which your nostrils detect from the fluo
So you pucker your lips and you take a few sips
Of that good old mountain dew. ...
High on a hill there's a secluded still
And it's run by a hard-working crew
You can tell very well as you sniffle a smell
It's that good old mountain dew. *
My brother Paul, he is tiny and small
And he measures 'bout four its two
But he thinks he's a giant when they give him a pint
Of that good old mountain derz.
Miss Jane Machume tried a brand new perfume
It had such a sweet smellinc pew
Was that lady surprised when she had it analyzed
It's that good old mountain dew.
