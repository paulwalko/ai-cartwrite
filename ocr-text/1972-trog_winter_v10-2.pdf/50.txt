There's a giant doing cartwheels.
A statue wearing high heels
Look at all the hapny creatures dancin' on the lawn.
A dinosaur victrola
Listening to Buck Owens
Doo, doo, doo, lookin' out my back door.
Tamboūrines and elephants are plaģin' in the band
Won't you take a ride on_e flying spoon?
Wondrous apparitions provided by magicians
Doo, doo, 18, loolin' out my back door.

Torward troubles Illinois
Lock the front door, oh boy

It'll bother me tomorrow
Today I'll buy no sorrow
Doo, doo; doo, lookin' out my back door. .
