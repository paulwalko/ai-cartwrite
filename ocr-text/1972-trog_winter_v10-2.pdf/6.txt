The New River cuts through the Fool's Face divide,

And her currents run deep and her waters run wide,

You rapids have slashed us and drawn out our blood,
Oh, damn you, New River, we curse your thick mud,
Oh River, oh River, the fight had begun,
There was no turning back till the battle was won.
We gathered together on the eastern shore,
With cases of beer and tubes by the score,
Said Vig to his ship mates, "We're in a fine state,
The damn raft's not built and now we're running late."
Well, we pushed on out til water reached our knees,
And like New World explorers, we challenged unknown seas,
The. rafts were beat and tossed about, paper ships on the ocean,
Still we popped a few more beers and splattered suntan lotion.
Yes, the sun was hot and the beer was cold,
The women were brave and the men were bold,
But a drunk's a drunk and it's plain to see,
That drunken bunch on New River made history.

We conquered New River that fateful day of May,
But the tale's not ended, there's one thing more to say,
Though the rafts all have vanished, and the cavers they are gone,
In the hills west of Blacksburg - New River is flowing on.
