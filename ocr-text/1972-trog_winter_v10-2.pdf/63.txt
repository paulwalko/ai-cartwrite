Catbirds and cornfields, daydreams together
Riding on the roadside the dust gets in your eyes
Reveling, disheveling, the summer nights can bring :
Pussywillows, cattails, soft winds and roses.
Slanted rays and colored days, stark blue horizons
Naked limbs and wheat bins, hazy afternoons
Voicing, rejoicing, the wine cups do bring
Pussywillows, cattails, soft winds and roses.
Harsh nights and candle lights, wood fires a'blazin'
Soft lips and finger tips, resting in my soul
Treasuring, remembering, the promise of spring
Pussywillows, cattails, soft winds and roses.
