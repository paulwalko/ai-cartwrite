I don't care if it rains or freezes
tingg as I've got my Plastic Jesus
Riding on the dashboard of my car.
Through my trials and tribulations
And my travels through the nations
With my Plastic Jesus I'll go far.

HU-
Plastic Jesus, Plastic Jesus,
Riding on the dashboard. of my car
Ijm afraid He'll have to go
His magnets ruin my radio
And if I have a wreck Ho'll leave a scar..
.
Riding down a thoroughfare with his nose up in the air
A wreck may be ahead but he don't mind
Trouble coming, he don't see, he just keeps his eyes on me
And any other thing that lies behind.
Plastic Jesus, Plastic Jesus,
Riding on the dashboard of my car
Though the sunshine on his back
Makes him peel, chip, and crack
A little patching keeps him up to par,
When I'm in a traffic jam, He don't care if I say damn
I can let all sorts of curses roll
Plastic Jesus doesn't hear, for he has a plastic ear
The ine? who invented plastic saved my soul.
Plastic Jesus, Plastic Jesus
Riding on the dashboard of my car
Once his robe was snowy white
Now it isn't cuite so bright
Stained by the smoke of my cigar.
If I weave around at night
And the police think I'm tight
They'll never find my bottle though they ask
Plastic Jesus shelters me, for his head comes off you see
He's hollow and I use him for a flask.
Plastic Jesus, Plastic Jesus,
Riding on the dashboard of my car
Ride with me and have a dram
of the blood and of the Lamb Plastic Jesus is a holy bar.
