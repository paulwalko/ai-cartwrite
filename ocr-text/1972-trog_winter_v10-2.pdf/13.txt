BUC KOE'S MEMOIRS
. FUH
My sense of balance was off today
Just because of you last night
.
Every time I thought about the things we did
I stumbled plumb outta sight.
The candy-sweet craziness of losing myself
Today in thinking of you
Just couldn't have felt better unless I'd got a letter
Saying you'd gone crazy too,

HEY RODEO YOU'RE A PRETTY GOOD SHOW
YOU CAN SÃœRE BUST A BUCKOE'S MIND,
HEY MY COUNTY FAIR YOU'RE A BLUE RIBBON MARE
AND I'D SURE LIKE TO RIDE THAT KIND.

One morning I remember, it began with you
I've never felt so good so early
Suddenly you knocked upon my window pane
Well kiss my birth, what a 'reveille
In our birthday suits we had a few toots
And I sure ain't talking about beer.
If you aim to please, well mam, I do believe
You're the best shot I've had in years,
HEY, SING A 'SUNSHINE, YOU MAKE ME FEEL MIGHTY FINE
YOU'RE A HOLIDAY IN MY HEAD
HEY, FLOWER-FACE, HOW 'D YOU LIKE TO RACE
BETCHA I CAN BEAT YA TO THE BED AGAIN.
Seem like I'm always alone on foot
With three things that need to be carried.
You might say my luck runs true to form
'Cause the woman I love is married.
When I think about our two lifelines
Threading through time and chance
I feel kinda cool, we shared a tool -
Weaving in and out of our pants,
HEY, MY LITTLE KIDDO, I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I MISS YOU BUT IT AIN'T ALL BAD,
'CAUSE MY PRETTY PAL, YOU'RE THE BEST GAL
I'M THINKING I'VE EVER HAD..
