BOTTLE OF WINE
:
A
BOTTLE OF WINE, FRUIT OF THE VINE
WHEN YOU GONNA LET ME GET SOBER?
LEAVE ME ALONE, LET TIE GO HOME
LET TIE GO HOME AND START ÖVER.

Rambling 'round this difty ola tów
Singing for ni
Time's getting rough, I ain't got enough
To buy a little bottle of wine.
Little hotel, colder than hell
Darl as the coal in a mine.
Blankets are thin, I lay there and grin
Cause I got a littlo bottle of wine.
Pain in my head, bugs in any bed
Pants are so old that they shine.
Out on the street, tell the people I meet
Won't you buy ine 2 bottle of wino?
A preacher will proach and a teacher will teach
A miner will dig in a nine,
I ride the road, trusting in God
Hugcing my bottle of wine.
