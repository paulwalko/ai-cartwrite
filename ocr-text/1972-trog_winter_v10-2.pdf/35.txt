Come all you young people and listen to what I tell
C . . D7
The fate of Floyd Collins a lad we all knew well.
G
His face was fair and handsome his heart was true and brave
D7 G
His body now lies sleeping in a lonely sandstone cave.
How sad how sad the story it filled our eyes with tears,
His memory will linger for many mạny a year.
His broken hearted father who tried his boy' to save
Will now weep tears of sorrow at the door of Floyd's cave.
Oh mother don't you worry, dear father don't be sad ,
I'll tell you all my troubles in an awful dream I had,
I dreamed I was a prisoner; my life I could not save,
I cried, "Oh must I perish within the silent cave?"
The rescue party gathered, they labored night and day,
To move the mighty boulder that stood within the way.
"To rescue Floyd Collinss" this was the battle cry.
"We will never, no we will never let Floyd Collins die!"
But on that fatal morning the sun rose in the sky,
The workers still were busy, we will save him by and by.
But oh how sad the ending,' his life they could not save.
His body then was sleeping within the lonely cave.
Young people all take warning with this for you and I
We may not be Floyd Collins, but you and I must die,
It may not be in a sand cave in which we find our tomb,
But at the mighty judgement we soon must find our doom.
