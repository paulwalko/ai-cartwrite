THE WHEREFORE AND THE WHY

When I woke up this morning, something inside of me
Am G.
Told me that this would be my day.
I heard the morning train, I felt the wind change
Am G
Too many times I'm on my way.

COME ON SUNSHINE, WHAT CAN YOU SHOW , ME;
WHERE CAN YOU LAKE ME, TO MAKE ME UNDERSTAND,
THE WIND CAN SHAKE ME, BROTHERS FORŠAKE ME
THE RAIN CAN TOUCH ME, BUT ČAN I TOUCH THE RAIN?

Then I saw the sun rise, above the cotton skies,
Just like a candy ane delight,
I saw the milkman, I saw the businessman,
I saw the only road in sight,
Then I got to thinking, what makes you want to go
To know the wherefore and the why
It's been so many times, oh Lord, I can't remember
If it's September or July.
REFRAIN
Then all at once it came to me, I saw the wherefore
And you can see it if you try.
It's in the sun above, it's in the one you love,
You'll never know the reason why.
REFRAIN
So much to lose, so much to gain,
