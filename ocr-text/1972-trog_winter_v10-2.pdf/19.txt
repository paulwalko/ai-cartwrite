Yesterday a child,came out to yander
Caught a dragon fiy inside a jar
Fearful when the sky was full of thünder
And tearful at the falling of a står.
Then the child grew ten times round the season
Skated over ten clear frozen streams :
Words like "when you're older" must appease him
And promises of someday make him dream.
AND THE SEASONS THEY GO ROŚND AND ROUND
AND THE PAINTED PONIES GO UP
WE'RE CAPTIVES ON A CAROUSEL OF TÝME.
WE CAN'T RETURN WE CAN ONLY LOOK BEHIND FROM WHERE WE CAME
AND GO ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND IN A CIŘCLE GAřIE.
Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now
Cartwheels lost to cartwheels through the town
And they tell him take your time it won't be lóng now
Till you drag your feet to slow the circle dow12.
So the boy who dreamt at sixteen now is twenty
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true
There'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams and plenty
Before the last revolving year is through. .
