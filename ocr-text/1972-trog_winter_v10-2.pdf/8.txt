Yoah thoy ran through tho briars and thoy ran through the bramblos,
And thoy ran through tho bushes whore a rabbit couldn't go,
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'om,
On down the Mississippi to tho gulf of Moxico.
Wo fired our cannon til the barrol moltod down,
So wo grabbed an alligator an' wo fought another round.
Wo filled his head with cannon balls, and powdered his bohind.
And whon wo touchod the powder off the gator lost his mind. REFRAIN 1&2
