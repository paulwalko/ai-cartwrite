REY DE R.
I KROW YOU RYDER, GONNA MISS ME WHEN I'M GONE,
I KÑOW YOU RYDER, GONNA Miss Me WEN I'M GONE,
GONNA MISS YOUR DADDY ROLŽING IN YOUR ARMS.
Well, I ain't got a nickle, and I ain't got a lousy dime,
I ain't got a nickle, and I ain't got a lousy dime.
But I've got a long way to go before the end of my time.
It takes a hard-hearted woman makes a long time rýder feel bad,
I say a hard-hearted woman makes a long time Ryder feel bad,
She makes him remembor the long, hard road that he's had.
.
Did you ever wako up and find your Ryder gone?
Woll, did you ever wake up and find your Ryder gono?
It makos you feel bad and wish that you'd never boen born.
Well, the sun's gonna shine on my back door soma day,
The sun's gonna shino on my back door some day:
And tho wind from tho rivor is gonna blow all my troubles away.
