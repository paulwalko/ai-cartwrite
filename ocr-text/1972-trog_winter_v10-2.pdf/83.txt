WILD WOOD FLOWER
.
I will twine with my mingles of raven black hair.

With the roses so red and the lilies so fair
The myrtle so bright with its emerald dew

And the pale amaryllis and iris so blue,
I will dance, I will sing and my life .shall be gay,
I will charm every heart, in its crown I will sway,
I woke from my dream and all idols was clay,
And all portions of lovin' had all flown away.
He taught me to love him and promised to love
And cherish me over all other above,
My poor heart is wondering, no misery can tell,
He left me no warning, no words of farewell,
My poor hear me over all". and pron
He taught me to love him and called me his flower,
That was blooming to cheer him through life!s. weary hour,
How I long to see him and regret the dark hour,
He's gone and neglected his frail wildwood flower,
