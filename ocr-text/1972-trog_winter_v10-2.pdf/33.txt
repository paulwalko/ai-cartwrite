· THE FALCON
12.1.2
I was walking out one ovening by the frigging roservoir,
A-wishing that I had a quid to pay my frigging scožo.
My hoad it was a-aching, my throat was parched and dry,
So up I sont a little prayer a wifiğing to the sky,
There camo a frigging falcon and ho walked upon the waves,
I said a frigging miracle and sang a couple stavos.
Of a frigging churchy ballad I learned at my mothor's knoe,
But thon the frigging bird took off, he wont and splattered me,
I dropped upon my frigging kneos and bowod my frigging head,
And said threo frigging aves for all the frigging dead.
Thon I roso unto my feet and said anothor ton,
Tho frigging bird burst into flamo and splattered me again,
Tho falcon blazod up in tho sky just liko tho frigging sun,
I soarod my frigging eyei:ids shut and when the job was done.
He wooshod across the trigging sky just liko a shooting star,
I went to soo the frigging priost, ho bummed my last cigar.
I told him of the burning bird, he told me of the roso,
I showed him guano ir nedir, the bastard hold his noso.
So I wont to soo tho 12.0p and the frigging bishop said,
Go home and sloop it oft you sot, and wash your frigging head.
Then I came upon a frigging wake, for a lousy frigging swine,
By the name of Jack O' Mera and I touched his hoad to mino,
He sat up in the frigging bed and shook his frigging head,
His wife pullod out a .44 and fillod him full of load,
Thon I lost my frigging temper and lot out a frigging yoll,
Blow ono more holo in poor old Jack and I!11 see you burn in hell.
And onco again I raisod him up and brought him back to life,
He whimporod as his head camo off, this time sho usod a knife.
