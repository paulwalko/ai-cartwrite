COCA I N E BLUES
Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds,
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down.
G7
Went right home and I went to bed,
I stuck that lovin' . 44 beneath my head.
Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun,
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run.
Made a good run but I run too slow,
They overtook me down in Jaurez, Mexico,
Laid in that hot joint and shootin' the pill,
In walked the sheriff from Jerico Hill,
He said, "Willy Lee, you're not Jack Brown,
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down"
"Oh yes," I said, "Yes.my name is Willy Lee,
If you've got a warrant, just a read it to me,
Shot her down cause she made me slow,
I thought I was her daddy, but she had five more,"
When I was arrested I was dressed in black,
They put me on a train and they took me back.
Had no friends for to go m√Ω bail
They slapped my dider carcass in the county jail.
Early next morning 'bout half past nine,
I spied the sheriff comin' down the line.
Hocked and coughed as he cleared his throat,
He said, "Come on you diry hack, into the district court.
Into that courtroom my trial began,
Where I was held by twelve honest men.
Just before the jury started out,
I saw that little judge commence to look about.
In about five minutes in walked the man,
Holding the verdict in his right hand,
The verdict read in the first degree,
I hollered, "Lordy, lordy, have mercy on me!"
The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen,
Ninety-nine years in the Folsom Pen.
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground.
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down.
Come on you gotta listen unto me
Stay off that whiskey and
Let that cocaine be.
