Come all you young fellows so bold and so brave
And seek not adventure way down in a cave
It forms like a habit and seops into yo
Till your skin bleaches white and your veins fill with mud.
OH, IT'S DÄRK AS A DUNGEON AND DÂMP AS THE DEW
WHERE THE DANGERS ARE DOUBLE AND THE PLEASURES ARE_FEW
WHERE TĦE GRASS NEVER GROWS AND THE RAIN NEVER FALLS
AND THE SỨN NEVER SHINES IN THOSE UNDERGROUND HAÎLS.
E7

There's duckways and crawlways and bottomless pits
You're sore and you're tired and scared out of your wits
If you slin from your footing you'll likely be dead
But you can't straighten up without cracking your head.
Oh, it's many a fine man I've seen in my time
who has sunk to the depths and been lost in the grime
Like a fiend with his dope or a drunk with his booze
He can't shake the mud from his old caving shoes.
So if you are searching for thrills and delights ::
Stay above the ground on the tree covered hoights
For once you descend, it's as though to the grave
For your soul will be lost to the lure of the cave.
