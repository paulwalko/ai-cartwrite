THE S A L V A T I ON ARMY SONG
we're coming; we're coming, our bráte little bånd
On the right side of temperance we n8w make our stånd
We don't use tobacco because we do think :
That the people who ruse' itoare liable to drink. Az
AwłY, AWAY WITH. RUM;BY GUN, WITH BUM BY 'GUS? WITH RİM BY GUM
AWAY, AWAY WITH RUM BY GUM ; THE SSIVG : OF THE SALVATION ARMY
We never eat cookies because they have yeast
And one little bite turns a man to a beast
Oh can you imagine a Badder disgrace
Than a man in the gutter with crumbs on his face..
We never eat fruit cake because it has rum
And one little slice puts a man on the bum :
Oh can you imagine a sorrier sight
Than a man eating fruitcake until he gets tight..
We never drink water., they put it in gin
And one little sip and a man starts to grin
Oh can you imagine à sorrier sight."
Than a man drinking water until he gets ripe.
We never eat prunes because they have pits
And one little prune gives a man the shits
Oh can you imagine a sorrier sight. ..::
Than a man eating prunes and shitting all night...
We never drink tea; they mix it with wine.
And one little drink turns a man to a swine. .
o can you imagine a sorrier sight !"
Than a man drinking tea and singing all night.
We never eat chocolate, because it has nuts
And the least little bit turns a girl to a slut
Oh can you imagine a sorrier mess
Than a girl eating chocolate while trying to :undress...
----
We never eat co-eds because they have hair
And the least little bit turns a man to a bear
Oh can you imagine a sorrier sight
Than a man eating co-eds and growling all night.
Oh we have Viceroys for men who think
And we have Ban for those who stink
But stinking and thinking, they don't bother me
I solve all my problems with Teton Tea.
