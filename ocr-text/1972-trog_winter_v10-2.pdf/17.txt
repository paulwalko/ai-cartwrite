once a jolly caveman campog beside a sinkhole'
Under the shadow of a hickory, tree...
Ang ho sång as he săt and charged up his carbide lamp
You'll come a-calling lathilda with me.
CAŢING IATHILDA, CAVING WATHILDA
YOU'LL COME A-CAVING MATHILDA WITH SE
AND HE SảNG AS HE SÃT AND_CHARGED UP HIS CARĒ IDE LAMP
YOŮ'LL COME A-CLVING MATHILDA WITH ME.

Into the sinkhole free-rappeled the spelunker
Spied he stalactites and broke them with glee
Spied he stalactites and stuffed them in his caving pack
You'll come a-caving Mathilda with me.
Down came the owner with his trụsty shotgun.
Down came the deputies one, two, three
Where's those stalactites, you've got in your caving pack
You'll come a-caving Mathilda with me..
U jumped the caveman, he leaped into the bottomless pit
You'll never catch ne alive cried he.;
And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that sinkhole
You'll come a-caving Mathilda with me.
