THERE'S WHISKEY IN THE JAR.
One day as I was goin' over Gillgara Mountain
I met with Col. Pepper and his money he was countin'
I rattled my pistols and I drew forth my raiper
Saying, "Stand and deliver, for I am a bold deceiver,"
I robbed Colonel Pepper up on Gillgara Mountain
Took the gold to Jenny for to help me with the countin'
But Jenny called the guards, Lord I never saw so many
Almost lost my freedom 'cause of darlin', sportin' Jenny.
All those golden coins sure did look bright and plenty
Then I lost them all to my darlin', sportin' Jenny
She yowed and she swore that she never would deceive me ...
But the Devils' in the women, Lord they certainly can be easy.
I went into my chamber for to get myself some slumber
Dream of gold and jewels and sure it is no wonder .....
Jenny to my pistols went, and she filled them up with water
Called on Colonel Pepper to get ready for the slaughter.
