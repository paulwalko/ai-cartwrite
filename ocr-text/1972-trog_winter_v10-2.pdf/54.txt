Way down in the state of Georgia,
D
Through the swamps and everglades
G
There's a hole in Tyler Mountain,
God help the man who gets lost in Miller's Cave.

I had a girl in Wake horse,, Georgia,
But she had unfai.thful ways,
Made me feel I was unwanted
Like the bats and the bears in Miller's Cave
I couldn't stand the way she did me,
Couldn't take her low-down ways,
Before I'll stay with a cheating woman
I'll go live with the bears in Miller's Cave.
I caught her out one Sunday morning
With a man they call Big Dave,
Me anest man in Wakehorse, Georgia,
I'd rather fight a mountain lion in Miller's Cave .
Hн
I said you'll pay both you and Davey,
I'm gonna see you in your graves.
They laughed at me and then I shot them.
I took their cheating, scheming bodies to Miller's. Cave.
That woman made me feel unwanted,
But I showed her I was brave,
Most wanted man in the state of Georgia,
But they'll neyér find me , cause I'm lost in Miller's Cave.
