An old cowpoke wont riding out one dark end windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way.
When all at once ? mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A plowing through the ragecd skies and up a cloudy draw.

YIPPIE_YI AY, YIPPIE YI OH,
THE GHOST RIDERS IN THE SKY...
Their brands were still on fire and their hoofs were made
of steel,
Their horns were black and shiny, their hot. breath ho
:...could feel.
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through
the sky,
For he saw the riders coming hard and he heard their
mournful cry.
:
Their face was gone, their oyes were blurred, shirts all
soalced with sweat, i
They're riding hard to catch that herd, but they ain't
caught them yet.
Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in
the sky,
On horses snorting firo; as they ride on hear their cry.
As the riders rode on by him, he heard one call his name,
"If you want to save your soul from hell, 2-riding on our
range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will.....
ride,
A trying to catch the devil hord across these endless ::
skies,"
