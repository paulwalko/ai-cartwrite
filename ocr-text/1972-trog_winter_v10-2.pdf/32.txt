Am
In the early morning rain
With a dollar in my hind:
With an iching in my heart
And my poclrets full of s√∂nd.
I'm a long way from home
And I miss my loved one so
In the early morning rhiin
Anna no place to go.
Out on runway no. nino
Big 707 set to go
But I'm stuck hore on the grass
Where the cold wind blows.
NOW tho licuor tasted good
And the womon all were fast
Well, now there she goes my friend
She's rolling down at last.
Hear the nighty engines roar
See the silver bird on high
She's away and westward bound
Tar above the clouds she'll fly.
Where the morning rain don't fall
And the sun always shines
She'll be flying over iny home
In about three hours tinc.
This old cirports got me down
It's no earthly good to me
Cause I'm stuck here on the ground
Cold and drunk as I can be.
You can't jump a jot plano
Like you can 3 freight train
So I'd bost be on my way
In the carly morning rain.
You can't jump 2 jet plane
Like you can a freight train
So I'd best be on my way
In the early morning rain.
