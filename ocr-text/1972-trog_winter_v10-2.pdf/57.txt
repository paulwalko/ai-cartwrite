Well, my cousin Mort, he's saved off and short
Mieasures just four foot two
But, he'll kill you a giant if you give him a pint
Of that good old mountain dew.
Well, my sister Brigit was really quite frigid
When asked what to do
But she'll get cuite hot if you give her a shot
Of that good old mountain dew.
Well, Mr. Roosevelt told me just how he felt
The day that the dry law went through
If your liquor is too red it'll swell up your head
A-drinkin' that good old mountain dew.
IIy cousin Bill has a still on the hill
Where he runs off a gallon or two
And the birds in the sky get so high they can't fly
On the varors of that good ole mountain dew.
