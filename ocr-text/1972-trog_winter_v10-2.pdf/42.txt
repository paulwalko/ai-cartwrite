AVAY
GREEN, GREEN, IT'S GREEN THEY SAY
ON THE FĂR SIDE OF THE HILL
GREEN, GREEN, I'M GOING AWAY
TO WHERE THE GRÅSS IS GRÉENER STÍLL.
Well I told my mama on the day I was born, .'
Don't you cry when you se! I'm_gône.
There ain't no woman gonna setfle me down,
I just gotta keep à traveling on.
Now there ain't no body in this whole vide world,
Gonna tell me how to spend my time.
I'm just a food, loving traveling man,
Saying, "Buddy can you spare mne a dime."
Yeah, and I don't care when the sun goes down,
Where I lay my weary head.
Green green, valley or rocky road,
It's there I'm gonna make my bed.
