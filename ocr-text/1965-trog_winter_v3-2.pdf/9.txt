parts of this cave make it very interesting:
to After lunch we were aff to Propst Cave. After battling
our way through herds of thousands of turkeys, we arrived
at the entrance to find three other car loads of people,
Bill Mauck (and his new wife) led us to the top of the
drop looking into the Far Room, but we did not have enough
rope to rig it so we headed out, passing all the others on
their way in.
The banquet that night came off very well and much
credit has to be given "Ham" Hamiltor and his crew from
P.S.C, who ran the whole weekend quite well. Awards were
made ( I didn't realize P.S.C, members were such great
cavers) and everyone adjourned to the dance floor, parties,
or the bar. After the night got late the parties got better
and Ed Day put on quite a good show of alternately passing
out and awakening to drink some more, I would be glad to:
give a talk sometime on the finer points of sleeping in
the ladies lounge.
The next morning-not so early, we ate and got an early
start for home. Whitt tells me that his group first saw
Kenny-Simmori's. Cave, Vince and I stopped at the quarry
at Judy Springs and then tiredly proceeded on our way.

built his home on a hill above Luray Caverns. A five foot
wide shaft was: sunk from his back yard to the cave 357.
below. A 42" fan was mounted above it and and 150' long
enclosed passage lead to the house from where smaller ducts
circulated throughout the house, A method was devised
for heating air in the passageway or drawing pure, cold
cave air directly into the house. "The humidity was regulated
in a large chamber in the basement. "In addition to remaining
at a constant dust and pollen free 54-degrees the underground
air contained fewer bacteria than a hospital operating
room.
