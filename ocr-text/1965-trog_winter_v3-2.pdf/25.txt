About 100 yards rest of the entrance is a large resurgence
which may or may not be the cave strearth, as it seems to flor even
when the cave stream is not. Patton's Cave is in the LOICT stratas
of the Stones River limestone,
Fletcher's Cave, Gap Mills, líonroo County (37°33'26*1780°23'30")
is in the west end of a valley sink, vith a stroan flowing into the
entrance. Beyond the first lov, wet spot is another opening to the
surface. The passage parallels the SW strike of Peter's Mountain,
and tales the form of a zig-zag stream passage, low in places. In
a number of places the stream cuts across joints in the linestone
and minor rooms about 101 high, 31 wide, and 30 or 40 feet long
are developed sier to the stream, but on an upper 10val. About
500 feet in, a good-sizod room is davoloped on a higher level and
contains many larga, white formations. Along the stream level,
rrany small formations ray be observed. A fantastic rock mushroom
is on the stron level about 10001 from the ontranco. After 2000!
the passage is roduced to a narrow crawl through brealidown, and
ends shortly afterward in a siphon pool. This cave is apparently
in the Boelmantown linestone.
After wo had visited those trio caves on February 1, 1964. I
had tho norve to suggest that ug Soo Lushi's Cave. This brought
on a chorus of protests, so the returned to Toch having acconiplished
almost nothing. Why is it that some poople have this thing about
slooping at night?
After this sed trip, I took my project to a follow who is
somovhat less of a spelunkor, but moro of a spelgologistGary
McCutchen. He becamo inmediately interested in tho area, so
March 7 saw Gary, Doug Cochrany Jay Murray, and I got out for
Gap Mills. In the moanwhile, I had baconio intorested in a few
caves just over the hill in the next drainage system which looked
inviting.
We first chocked out Fulton's Cave and the cavo which,
"repuditally of largo size, lies across the valley.". Wo took the
liborty of naning this second cavo "Turkay Creole Cava" only to
find out later that this is really its Izano. .Alter FC had spont
the daylight hours beating tho bushes, chasing skunlis, and crawling
into rosurgences, Wo set out for Iuslis (Chambor's) Cave, As Fra
voro procoeding to lool for the cave va canc upon 3 gontlomen who
first agreed to show us tho ontrancethon decided to show us the
ontiro Cave. The oIdost of the bunch was Joe Lushes Tho had been
in the cave quite a few ting S. So wa f'irod up Our lamps and took
à guided tour of Lushi's Cave, which proved to be quite a spectacular
cavern. Joc Lusk montioned something about a group from "up mawtin"
(probably D.C. or Baltimoro) that comes down to that cave & ICV
timos every year. I wonder who thor aro, and if they have a map
of this cavo. I to so, V.P.I. would lillo to borrow it to make a
tracing sometime. Since this initial visit to Lusk's CCVC, at
least 3 more groups frori V.P.I.' have beon thicro,
