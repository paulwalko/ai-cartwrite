From the bottom of the drop, a high, narrow passage trends
SV over 4 climbs: 20 feet up, 20 feet down (handline needed),
20 feet up, and 20 feet down. A single 100 foot rope can be
rigged and used on the last three climbs. About 30 feet from
where this passage ends, there is a fissure in the ceiling
which leads to a sinuous canyon passage. This canyon tees to .
the main cave passage. To the right, the passage ends in a ..
number oŤ shallow wells in the floor. There is a network of
sewer passages, leading from the bottomó To the left of the
intersection, the main cave trends NE for about 3000 feet as
a large, rectangular corridor, 50 feet by 50 feet in some: places.
Deep piles of guano cover most of the floor. Several drainage :
canyons lead off from under breakdown, and several pits about :
50 feet deep open in the floor. The main cave ends in an area
of large, fallen slabs. There are a fer formations near the
end.

See Douglas, p. 515. In a large valley sink is a trash-filled
sinkhole with limestone escarpments on three sides. At one
end, under the brush, is a large entrance leading into a big
room. About 100 feet from the entrance, a good-sized stream
is encountered. The downstream passage goes about 300 feet
as a wide cherty tunnel, ending in a still siphon pool.
There are several rooms on an upper level,
The unstream passage goes about 80 feet to a narrow hole
where the stream enters. The water is over five feet deep in
places, and the passage is narrow and cherty. ...
We hope that, by publishing these descriptions, we will
Derform several functions. One is to suppliment Caves of .
Virginia, and aid in publishing the first revision, whenever
that might be. Also, we hope these descrintions will create
an interest in the possibilities of this area.
