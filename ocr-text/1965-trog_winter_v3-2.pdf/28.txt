Tho discovery of this cava was enough to makc thc trip
success. When wo rcturnca to the surface, wc received an invitation
to sloop in Joo's back yard, and we woro troated to hot :coffco thate
night and cgain at broakfast. Joc told us of En McClung's Cavo, at
Zenith, but was afraid the oinor vould object to us antoring it on.
Sunday. So: 1C rounded out the tockond by return trip to Lusk's .
and did some more exploring on the upper levels. .
Having pushod every cave to cntored boyond published dascriptions,
and having stumbled upon two proviously unreported canvas, ond Oi*
which was virgin in part, wo lile to think that there is more to do
112 this croa. But wa arc publishing this much of our cfforts in
hopcs that perhaps SOLIcong who has further information on this
Erce would enlighten us to some of their findings. Maanwhilo,
looli for a futuro issue of tho Troglodyte to carry morc information
on the Gap Mills-Zenith crear
