SCHOOLHOUSE CAVE is CLOSED?
It looks as though another one of Germany Valley's
famous caverns: is closed to cavers... I imagine most cavers
are aware of the fact that Mystic cave has recently been
closed to visitors, And now, what may very well be West
Virginia's most well-known cáve, is also closed.
During the recent eld-Timer's reunion in Franklin,
I had the opportunity to speak with Gerald J. Kimble, owner
of Schoolhouse cave. He informed me at that timó of his
pilans to close the cave permanently. His reasons included:
trash left outside by visitors, people camping in his field,
people being trapped in the cave, and other such incidents.
He also complained about people not asking permission' to
enter his cave. His biggest complaint, however, was the
frequent accidents requiring action by local police.
There is an outside possibility that Kimble will allow
people into the cave if they ask his permission, but any-
one ignoring the "No Trespassing" signs around the sinkhole
may end up visiting with the local law agents,
Once it is closed, the re-opening of this cave to
frequent visitors may present quite a problem. Perhaps
the best solution would be to stay away from the cave for
a year or so, The owner is undoubtably aware of the reputa-
tion of his cave and has probably become quite swell-headed
over the years. He has something that we want. If cavers.'
avoid Schoolhouse cave perhaps he would forget after a while,
become more congenial toward cavers, and re-open the cave,
Of course, it would be a good idea if future explorers
obserye a few of the basic rules regarding cave owner re-
lations that deal with such things as permission, gates,
spent carbide, trash, noise, ets.
These rules have been stated over and over and there
is no valid reason for not observing them.
Of course, Pendelton County caves are subject to
many visits by inexperienced and uninformed persons, in-
asmuch as it is the scene of two yearly IOCA functions,
not not to mention the crowds that flock weekly to Seneca
Rocks and go sight-seeing after it is too dark or too cold
to climb,
A large portion of those people are non NSS members
and are not versed in how to handle cave owners. If we,
as cavers, are to continue to enjoy the freedom of visiting
these caves, then we must seek these people out and educate
them. A) SO, sell subscriptions to the Tech Troglodyte
