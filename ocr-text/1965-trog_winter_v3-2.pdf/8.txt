LABOR DAY IN FRANKLIN
The evening of September 4 saw Vince Kappler, a Northern
New Jersey caver, and I leave home, pick up a couple of ..
cases (not enough) of beer and head for the Old Timers
Reunion.
We reached the Franklin area about 4 a.m. and the party
at the American Legion Hall--the headquartersm was' still
in progress. As I swung my VW into a parking place, who
was standing in the glare of the headlights without any
pants on? None other than Ed Day. We greeted him and
noticed a few others still awake, Bobbi Nagy (where was
Donna?) from Nittany was there along with Bob Thren and
Charlie Lewis from Reading. Fictitious Lew. Bicking was there
too, I think.
I was: awakened in the morning, not by the warm rays
of the sun, but by the continuous flow of words from a
familiar mouth. Should I turn over and find out who it.
was or not? There, in all his resplendent glory was surely
the greatest climber of them all, he wore a smart beret,
a new suede jacket, a new pair of Lederhosen and never
scuffed climbing boots. Across his chest was slung a
dagger (later we were told it is used for cutting belay
lines, 1 if necessary). Well, there he was, member of all
the firsts, Rappel Pad Joem-need I say more? (obviously
a displaced member of Baltimore Grotto since he likes to
cut belay ropes.)
That morning we also met up with Whitt and his brother
Barry, Jay Murray, and Gary McCutchen, all from V.P.I.
Soon Bob Robbins and his crew from P.$.c. arrived on the
scene. Sarah Corrie in her truck was there too, along
with many others.
After breakfast it was off to the Sinnitt-Thorne
Mountain complex. We entered the Sinnitti entrance, traversed
back through the cavÄ—, up the silo passage and into the
800' long "big room". Down through a side passage and
through a blowhole we went,: pulling and pushing Gary all ..
the way. After realizing we had made the connection with .
Thorne mountain. we lost our way and returned the way we
came--almost.

That afternoon the cave olympics were held-ladder
climbing, prussicking, cave crawling, and cave packing,
but wewent swimming instead.
The next day we were up early and soon had climbed
the steep hill and found ourselves at the entrance of Minor
Rexrode Cavea We spent a couple of hours in three and
walked, climbed and crawled over breakdown and through
passages for about 1000 feet. The maze features of certain
