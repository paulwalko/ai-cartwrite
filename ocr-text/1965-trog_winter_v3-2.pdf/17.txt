trip, other information was collected and is hereby presented
in hopes that it will stimulate further investigation of
this rather limited but potentially interesting limestone
are
Davis (1958) presented a short discussion of the
restricted limestones of Mercer County and made a brief
mention of ten caves. Bunker (1960) reported the exploration
and mapping of Beacon Cave, located two miles from Blue-
field, West Virginia, and 1000 feet behind the "Beacon
Drive-In". This is the largest inown cave in Mercer County
with approximately 22 miles of surveyed passages.
The following data was obtained in Mercer County during
the aforementioned Septombor trip. All locations are from
Davies (10c. cit.).
ABBS VALLEY CAVE 370171561. No: 8101910411 W. Bramwell Quad.
A 1 hour search in Abbs Válley on both sides of the
Virginia-West Virginia state line failed to reveal this
cave. Several persons who have lived in this area all of
their lives and who also live practically next to where the
the cave should exist knew nothing about it. They did,
however, continually refer to sovoral caves supposedly one
to two miles west of the state line in Tazewell County,
Virginia. Those were checked out and found to be the
Rosenbaum Caves which have been known to the Virginia Cave
Survey for a number of years.

INGLESIDE CAVE 37°18140" N.; 81°03'23" W. Bluefield. Quad,
The entrance is a window-like holo (five feet by five
feet) located near the base of a limestone outcrop. About
20 foot from the entrance, the cave stream resurges as a
apring from which the ovner obtains his water supply. A
single stream passage (approximately ten feet wide and eight
feet high) was followed for over 500 feet. The passage
continues on from this point at about the same dimensions.
According to Davies (loc. cit.) the passages extend for
2000 feet to the southwest.
HONA CKER AND CALDWELL CAVES. Narrows Quad.
In the past some doubt has existed as to which one
of these two caves is actually supposed to be Honacker's.
Perhaps the following information will help to clarify
this situction. Davies listed "Ionacker Caye as being 1.3
miles southeast of Pigeon Creek School (37°181481. N.
80°5542" W.) and Caldwell Cave as located 1.6 miles south-
east of the same school (3701.8154" N.; 80055138" W.)
Çausoy (1960), in giving locations for the cave milliped
(Zygonopus packardi) from date supplied her by Dr. Carl
Krekeler, listed Honaker (Honacker) Cave as being five
miles southwest of Glenlyn, Virginia. This could have been
