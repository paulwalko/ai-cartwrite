THE THREE-ROPE RIG
I
The three-rope rig is a method of training in the use of
the chest prusikas a safety when rappelling.
Its development was prompted by the accident of May 1 in
the Newberry-Banes system,

Stripped of all. nonessential details, the accident occurred
as follows: A caver (not from this club) was descending the
180 foot drop in Newberry and lost control approximately 120
feet from the bottom. She panicked and did not let go of her
chest prusik, but instead rode it hard and fast for about 100
feet, when her head struck a glancing blow on a ledge. Her
hard hat saved her from serious head injury, even though it
was splintered at the point of contact, knocked off with the
chin strap broken.
This blow stunned her enough to cause her to release her
chest prusik. This jammed on the rope. However, rope stretch
carried her to the floor hard enough to break her right leg
and left ankle.

Or
The accident was due entirely 'to human error, As soon as
the human quit erring, the safety equipment (chest prusik)
took over and saved her life,
The nylon prusik was essentially undamaged by its fast,
hard ride down the rope, as shown by the fact that it sub-
sequently held fast under an impact stress, computed by two
different methods to be about 1500 pounds, and was still in
a safe and usable condition. A manila prusik would almost
certainly have broken, especially if it were at all used.
Had the climbing rope been manila instead of the half-inch
nylon that was used, it would derinitely have broken.
The manner in which this accident happened prompted the
development of a method of training a person to stop an un-
controlled fall by means of his chest prusik. A vertical
(free space is best) drop of 60-100 feet is necessary. One
rope is rigged to reach down only about 20 feet, then end.'
The second rope reaches all the way to the bottom. These
two ropes should use the same anchor, since they should be
alongside each other. The third rope is used for belay.
The belayer'sanchor must be seperate from the first two
ropes. In use, the trainee attaches his brake bar (or other
repelling device) to the short rope and his chest prusik to
the long rope. The belayer leaves enough slack, laid out bem
tween trainee and belayer, to allow the trainee to fall free-
ly à distance equal to slightly more than Ź the distance of
the rope. (A convenient method is to tie a small loop in the
end of the belay rope; lower it halfway down, and tie a piece
of cord tightly around the rope a foot or so below the break-
over. The trainee then clips this loop to his chest sling
