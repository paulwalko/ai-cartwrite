FALLOUT SHELTERS - HA!
The following ll caves are the ones which the N.S.S.
Fallout Shelter Committee feel warrant our investigation.
Anyone visiting these caves can help the project by
making a detailed survey of the cave, photographs if
possible, measure of temprature and humidity, and check .
for floodings. Check also to see if the ceiling is
stabile, the type and area of the floor in the larger
rooms, and in general, its livability. More details
are available from Rick Nolting.
