Arriving in the croa rather late, in the afternoon, wo docided
to look first for Crosicris Cava, not described in Devios. Inasmuch
as it was also mislocated, wo ended up, by e happy accident, at the
lioma of Joc Noel. As it turned out, Joc is a caror witla tho
Concord Cavo Club, and knows quite a bit about the caves of the
aroa. Ho was unablo to go caving with us, but he did show us the
entrences of two cavas. Crosior's and Miller's. We checked out
Crosiar's first, which did not prove to be very cutensive. We
wont next to Milloris, .3 mile vost of Crosior's. Inasmuch as
there is another cave known as Miller's in the arce, we dubbed this
ono Evolyn Miller's, to avoid confusion.
Wc explored the known part of Evolynı Millar's, which wasn'to
too much, but on tho way out, Jay spotted a holo in tho breakdown
that had apparently boon overlooked before. Through this holc, WC
found about 1000 foot of virgin ceve,
Crosiaris Cave, Zenithe 'Monroc County, (3703011711280°2912011)
Roncovcrta Quad. Elovation 2550. The entrance is in a sink about
50 foot south of the road to Zenith, and tales the form of several
holas at the base of a limestone Oscarpmont. On the loft is a
vogatable collar built of limestone blocks. In tho middle aro
several snall slots blockod up by sticles and surface soil. On
the right is a low crawl roughly parallcling the striko Of the rocks
with several leads down to the loft, coinciding with tho dip,
which is about 200. Thase loads opon into E smacIl a zo of zig-zag
sowor passag'as, all draining toward a central roon. This room
has a holo in the bottom through which watcr cxits, but becomos
too tight for humans. This hole shows signs of flooding. This
roon also contains an unusual limestono arch. Gravol and cobble
floors are found throught the cave, and incny passages are blocked

about 30 Iect to a breakdowa-lilled room. A passage at the lower
end leads dom to the "Big Room".
Boyond the big rooli, the passago tales the form of an
intermittent stroari bed in high canyon. There aro many crawl-
ways and sida rooms, sirilor in character to Crosicr's. There is
an upper lovel nazo of dry sewer passegos. Many loads have not
boon chocked out.
