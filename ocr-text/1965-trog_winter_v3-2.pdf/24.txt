CAVING ALONG THE ST. CLAIR FAULT
The St. Clair fault is an intense overthrust running to the
west of and parallel to Paters Mountain, in Monroe County, West
Virginia. Between the mountain and the fault zone is an area of
linestone hills and valleys, with large araas Iacking in surface
drainage, Iwo kinds of limestone outcrop hero; the Stonas River,
of early: Ordivician age, (naarest the mountain), and the Beekmantown
limestone, of Tata Canadian, age, :(nearest tha fault), West of the
fault zone. is mostly Beekmantown, with a fow hills of Stones River
lying immediately ta tiha waste of the fault,
Having visited Patton's Cavo, which is large and well-decoratad
and discovering that the other caves of the area were vaguely desc-
ribed in Cavams of wast Virginia, we decided that this area warrentad
claser study. One cave was nevar enterad, and another WES simply
rumored to exist, and the rostoi were described as "encountering
breakdawn or becoming quite low Or Maxtanding a considerable
distance beyond." In view of this area's close proximity to Blacks-
burg, this situation just couldn't be allowed to existio So Wa Crew
a circle around the drainaga arca forming the heactwaters of Second
Creek; and set out on the first expedition.
Our original intention was to visit Fletcher's and Chembor's
(now known locally as Lusk's) Caves, but the party I was "commandi-
ing" had other ideas, so it: was another trip to Patton's, and an
abbreviated trip ta. Élotchar's. Wherm Fietcher's turned out to be
a wet caye, I became quite unpopular, and the trip could be tormec
a failure, as we had not had time to find the other entrance to
Patton's anci, though we had gone beyond the published description :
af Flatcher's, we had to quit before we found the final siphon.
Femala cavers' -- Bah! Hora are the cascriptions.
Patton's Cave, Gap Mills, Monroe County, (37°32'36" x 80°2315611)
Roncevente Quad. The entrance is in the bottom: of a steep-sidec
sinkhole, and opens into nearly a mile of large, walking passage,
The first 3000 feet is floored with breakdown, clay, and pooIs',
until the main passage intersects å stream at right angles in the
Big Roorl!'. The upstream passage is several hundred feet long, and
has many deep pools in the floor. The downstream passage is now and
gravely, and after several hundred feathing intersects the main pass-
age nearer the entrance. The stream flowing through this passage
forms the stream which occupies the first 2.500 feeter of the cave,
Directly across the. Big Room is a large hold about. 6! off the floor
that; leads into the last 2000.foot of the cave. This back section
is Cifferent in character, being muddy and angri Iar rather than clean
and archeck. Many larga formations and rimstong pools are founci
here, Beyond this section, lots of loose broakcown is encounterede
Somewhere in this section is a narrow crawI through loose
rocks to an opening to the surface. The cave ends in a myrid of
muddy Breakdown rooris. :::
