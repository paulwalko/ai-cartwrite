After a short stop in New Orleans and a long drive
up through the Southern states, we stopped to see two caves
in northern Alabama. First was. Goat Cave, which has been
designated as a faillout Shelter and is made up essentially
of three long, low ceilinged rooms and several smaller
passages. The helectites in the area behind the third .
room are very photogenic and well worth the trip..
Next was Banana Cave, which has approximately three
miles of passages and in which we observed cave ratss
crickets, pats, two species of salamander, flatworms, and
a crayfish. Helectites, gypsum :crystals, and large
stalagmites make this cave very photogenic and well worth
the trip,
Case Cave, Georgia, was next on the agenda, but a
nasty female landowner wouldn't let us cross her land because
the locals had thrown beer cans in her garden, so we went
swimming instead.

The next day, after about 30 minutes of arguing with
the manager of Shenandoah Caverns, we realized he was not
about to let us into the wild cave on the property. We
conceded for a free trip through the commercial cave,
however, Somehow, beautiful as it was, Shenandoah was
a letdown after Senora.
