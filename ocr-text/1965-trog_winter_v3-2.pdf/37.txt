it bounces ofl ledges and projections, unrolling as it goes.
Tliere are no loose loops to snaps and it invariably focs all the
Tay to the bottom. Anyone wI2o has ever been "first inan doin" into
the Andrew's Roolil in Clover 10llow Cave 11220175 tine miserys of
stopping at every unlady lodge to Iricit the rope down, and finally
having to stop soi:1evhere near the bott 0111 to straighten out a "ropc
salac". On a raccnt trip into that cave, the above mentioned

was really "on the ball".
Keys
Due to the loss of various 7ioces 01" club equjmonto this
sunnor, the equip:cnt comunittce decided that it was necessary to
cliange the lock on tire club storcroon. In: ages hast, 211 officors
and colipnittee chainnon were assigned a loy, but no strict regulations
irerc in:posed upon the return and duplication of those keys. As a
rosult of this, inactive incu:bers and lonner members hold leys.
This led to a iroc 27ropriation of club equipment by irresponsible
pcrsons, rlrich, in turn, resulted in a loss of ropes. After the .
locli ves changed, only I'our ley's vere assigned and only to of"
thien VoTe hela by lieubers living on campus, and one of the could
not be loaned out. This resulted in pooul√® 20t returning equi:nent
becausc of the cirficulties in obtaining it. Altar several months
of this ridiculous situation, the club officers decided to have i
two more lieys made, and re-distribute them so tliat there are not
Tivo keys on campus. Pcrlians this isn't the ideal situation, but
so far it's the lesser of the threc evils.
