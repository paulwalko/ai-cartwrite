A good preliminary exercise is, while using a chest prusik, :
to let go with both hands simultaneously. This is not diffi-
cult to do, and gets the trainee used to the idea of letting
go of the chest prusik. When the trainee first drops on the
three-rope rig, he will probably watch for the end of the rope
so he can let go of his chest prusik as soon as he reaches the
end. However, this is to be discouraged. As soon as he is able
the trainee should ignore the end of the rope, so that the
fall is as unexpected as possible..
. A good exercise for a free-space drop would be for the
trainee to shut his eyes as soon as he is in free space and
can't bump into anything. He then has no idea of how far he
has rappelled or when the fall will occur. This becomes expeci-.
ally effective if the short (rappel) rope is left about ten feet
longer than usual.
* This rig also presses home several other points, such as:
tying a big knot in the bottom end of any rappel rope; not .
gripping hard with the guiding or balance (upper) hand, since
the separate chest prusik rope is slack rather than under ten-
sion and affords very little support; and getting ollse from a
hung chest prusik,
The reason for the knot in the end of the rappel rope is
presented especially vividly: there is no possible chance for
a person to stop himself with his chest prusik if he rappels ...
off the end of a rope. Rope stretch will snatch the end up.
through the brake: bar and prusik so fast that reaction is impos-
sible. Any trainee who doubt's this should try it for himself:
instruct your belayer to leave only enough slack for a five
foot fall past the end of the short rope, Rig both brake bar
and chest prusik on the short rope, Rappel off the end and at-
tempt to stop with the chest prusik. Unless the trainee cheats"
and watches for the end, he will not stop with his chest prusik.
Reaction time will be too slow.
After falling and being caught by your belayer, rig your
brake bar on the long rope and complete a belayed rappel to the
bottom, without the chest prusik. This should quickly convince
the trainee of the value of the knot in the end of the rappel
rope.
Sufficient and proper training on the three-rope rig des-
cribed above will go a long way in preventing any more accidents
like the one in Newberry, which would not have happened if the
injured caver had had experience in stopping an uncontrolled
fall with a chest prusik, and had therefore known what to expect
and been able to release the chest prusik so it could function
as intended---which it finally did (although a little late)
when she struck her head and was stunned into letting go.
