The placing of NSS cave registers.such caves
as Tawney's, Linkis, Southern's, and Giant might
be considered.
The participation in a cave clean-up project, such
as was accomplished in Giant Cave several
years ago
Participation in a fallout Shelter survey trip..
Participation in any project in which conser-
vation practices are carried out. Butleris
Cave might fit into this category.
Participation in a conservation slide show,
5)

to some, and those sho realize that wanton damage cannot

should have common sense enough to know right from wrong.
It is hoped that this plan will have its good effects and
will guide individuals toward their own personal conservation
aims
of the fallout Shelter survey caves alloted to our
grotto, three have been surveyed--General Davis, New River,
and Lowmoore, Possibly Paxtonls, Southern's, and Greenville
Saltpeter will be done by the end of the quarter.
It is hoped that the other five will be completed during
the winter quarter.
