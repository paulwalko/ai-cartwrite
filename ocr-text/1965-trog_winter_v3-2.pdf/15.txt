LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
:
Dear Dr. Karst:
(alias Greg Marland)
How are things in the old Southland ? I hope that the caves
are still as good as they used to be. The caves in New Eng-
land are terrible. The largest cave in New England (Twin
Lakes) is like taking a trip to Linkis. BobRalph and I have
joined the Central Connecticut Grotto, so we do a little
caving now and then.
What are you doing these da ys? Have you enter ed the woking
world er are you still goint to school? Say hello to Bonnie
for me. Did you go to the convention? Several people from
here came back very excited about Sonora, .
I will be leaving here on August 29 and heading south for :
two weeks. Will there be anyone in Blacksburg during that
time to go caving with? Also is the Old Timersi Reunion in
Franklin on Labor Day worth going to? If it is I will make
the scene. I am glad that Caves of Virginia was finally
published, although I was disappointed with the contents.
Too much space devoted to caves just for the record and not
enough to descritptions of the good caves.
Take care of yourself and write if you get a chance..

Dear Gary,
Enclosed find $1 for a subscription to 6 issues of the
Tech Troglodyte. This is actually a renewal of my old sub-
scription which runs out this summer. You can't lose at only
1 cent per page (or can you?).
I just finished reading the Fall Quarter, 1964 issue and
would like to make a few comments, one in regard to your
West Va. article (Mercer Co.) and theother in connection with
the Va. Cave Survey.
Re: A New Mercer County (West Virginia) Cave--I think
your new Cave Rat Cave is actually the same as Davies! Cald-
well Cave (see p. 157 in Davies). In the October 1962 issue
