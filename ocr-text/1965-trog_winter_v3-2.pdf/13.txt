Late that afternoon, we headed for the next of the
pre-convention field trip caves. This cave, Indian Creek
Cave, contains over 18,000 feet of passage and was one of
the most interesting of the caves. we visited. The entrance
is located upstream from a dam and is covered by an elaborate.
protective iron grating. In the case of a sudden rain,
it is very likely to fill up with water. The entrance
pit is about 120 feet deep and is descended via several
strong metal ladders. Reaching the bottom, we fowwowed
the upstream passage about 800 feet, where Carl somehow
lost his boats while it was on his foot, no less. Returning
to the surface, we fitted Carl out in a' set of sneakers,
returned to the cave and sought out the helectite Patty's.
Pretty Passage. Then we headed several thousand feet gown
the stream' passage, where it was necessary to swim (70 F
water temp.) and after emerging from the stream, we climbed
up to the beautiful Alice's wonderland. This flowstone
section of the cave almost matches some of Virginia's better
caves
Another cave worth mentioning was Bracken Bat Caves
This cave supposedly contains about 20 million mexican free-
tailed bats during the summer season. Arriving just before
dusk, we were treated to an informative. talk by Jim Baker
on this bat and its habits. Soon, slowly at first, the
bats started spiraling from the cave. A sight I will never
forget was the tremendous number of bats emerging in a
steady column and, swayed by the soft wind, flying into the
night.

After a Texas style barbecue, we were admitted "en
massell to the soon-to-be-commercialized Natural Bridge
Caverns. Guided by a pretty woman, we padded along softly
lit trails and view such wonderous and imaginative-sounding
sights as Sherwood Forrest, Furry. Castles, Castles of the
White Giants, the Hall of the Mountain Kings, and the
Valley of the fallen Lords.
The days of the formal convention proceedings were
spent at How.dy parties, swimming at Landa park, and attending
Congress of Grottoes meetings. We listened to talks on
the mapping of Mammoth Cave, cave divining in Pennsylvania,
Russ Gurnee's talk on the Rio: Camoy expedition, and caving
in Mexico; there were many others. Friday night was the
photo sal√≥n;, Saturday a geology field trip led by Porter
Montgomery.
The convention was terminated at the banquet where,
after awards, and door prizes were distributed, Barry Bishop
gave a tremendous slide-lecture on the American conquest of
