from Glenlyn. According to the locations given by Davies,
Honecker Cayo should be just south of the old Honacker
house, which is exactly 13 miles southeast of Pigeon Creek
School. Caldwell Cavo, then, should be the second cave.
10cted in a gap about 1200 feet 3SE of the Honacker house,
Cooper (1960) partially explored what he believed to be
Honacker Caye, located near the farm buildings on the
Honacker place and presumably the same. one as that listed
by Davies. Their descriptions (Cooper's and Davies'),
however, do not coincido.
On September 2, the writer lookod at the entrance to
onacker Cāve, but passed it up in favor of a cave rumored
by the local residents as being much larger and just up
the hollow in back of the farm house. Assuming Davies!
locations to be correst, this lattor cave should be Caldwell
Cave. The entrance to Caldwell is a large opening in a
shallow sink on the cast sido:of a hollow which extends
Ž mile from the northern base of East River Mountain to
a valley just cast of tho Honackor house. A small stream
coming from the mountain flows into the entrance, and after
a series of several small drops it sinks into the floor
about 100 feet inside of the cove. From hore the passage
continues for less than 200 foot to a Y intersection. The
right fork is very short and onds in a small room. The left
fork is a crawlway which continues low for about 50 feet.
and then gots very tight. Penetration beyond this point . .
could be effected with a certain amount of effort. The
floor is littered with washod-in dobris for 100' feet beyond
where the stream disappears indicating temporary flood con-
ditions during extremely wet weather.
According to the local people, there is a third cavo
located somewhere further up the same hollow that contains
the Caldwell Cave. This lead was also reported by Cooper
in 1960. To the writer's knowledge, this cave has nover
been recorded or described in the literature,
