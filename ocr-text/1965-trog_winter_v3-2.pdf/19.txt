MILLER'S COVE SURVEY
Somewhere on the densely-Woaded slopes below Dragon's
Tooth is a small inconspicuous opening into the nether
world. If you happen to be one of the elite few. who can
find the hole, then you know that it requires a mile or so
of walking an√°/cer a sturdy automobile. Inside the cave,
one encounters' muddy down-climbs, exposed traverses, low
crawlways, and, if you choose to go as deep as possible
in this state, there are long rappells.
But whatever one may encounter on the .way down, when
one reaches the bottom, everything that has gone before
suddenly becomes worth'it. For at the bottom is one of
Virginia's dozen or-so caves that have over a mile of
passage,
When this cave was first discovered by the VPI Cave
Club, it aroused considerable interest, but, due to the
difficulities involved in making an accurate surveys only
a preliminary map was prepared. This fall, however, has
seen rencwed interest in this large and beautiful cave,
and a number of survey trips have entered the cave with
brunton and tape.
It took three survey trips and a total of 14 hours
of work to reach the first. stream level several hundred
feet below the entrance. Now that this part of the cave
has been mapped the survey should go considerably faster,
Nonetheless, it will be quite some time before this grotto
publishes: a map of this. cave. It is known that over a
mile of passage exists; possibly two miles. How much is
beyond thisig only time, patience, and the steel tape will
tell.
. Another interesting aspect of this cave, which this
survey will settle, is its depth. The actual depth will
not be known until after the survey is complete, but
estimates run so high as 500 feet, making it a condidate
for Virginia's deepest cave.
The lion's share of credit for this survey goes to
Sam Dunaway. Thus far, he has organized all the survey
parties, computed all of the horizontal distances, and
has drawn several preliminary maps. Some credit is also
due to his lovely Wife for participating in the survey,
and, of course, for putting up with Same
