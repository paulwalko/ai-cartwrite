* ON THE TRAIL OF THE LONESOME PINE
Since the last issue of this informative journal of
speleology was published, : several trips have been made into
Southwestern Virginia by this Grotto . Here is a description
of some of the caves visited on these trips.
Indian Cave, Banner's Corner, Russell County, Va.
( 36째 52' 46" x 82째19'59") See Douglas, p. 428. The entrance is
in a trash-filled sink containing the remains of an old truck.
The passage descends steeply over trash and 100 se rocks, turning i
to the left and down over large hunks of break down, and into
a long room with a steeply slanting mud floor. The passage . .
from here is a rather obvious tunnel leading from the bottom i
of this room do vim over slick mud to the top of a good-sized
room. A large stream flows through this room and passage leads
in both directions. After several hundred feet, the passage upstream
encounters large slabs of break down and is reduced to narrow
crawlyays.
..........
The downstream passage, however, can be traversed for
perhaps 1600 feet before terminating in a quiet pool. The
main stream passage is practically void of side passages. The
stream becomes quite de en in places, and it is necessary to :
wade to see the cave. The cave is subject to flooding, proof
being given by the particles of organic matter found throughout
the cave.

The cave: contains a fair amount of beautiful speleo thems.
There are several areas of long, slender soda stras and one
area of massive flows tone mounds.

Saltville Quarry Cave, Smyth County, Va. (NW 4/7/6) See
Douglas, p. 503. Near Saltville are several old water-filled
limestone quarrys. The upper quarry lake is fed by a small
waterfall at one end. Near this spot, opposite the cliff wall,
is a large cave entrance, partially obscured by brush. Immediately
inside, the passage divides into an obvious water passage, and a
not-so-obvious dry route. The dry route, to the left, extends
about 100 feet to a small cravlway, which pinches off. The wet
route, deep in places, ends in a scum-covered pool. Several
areas of formations are encountered. The stream passage is
abundant in cave life, One large crayfish and a number of ..
salamanders tere observed.

Higgenbotham's #1, Tazewell County, Vaio (37째02'51"*81째 35' 34")
See Douglas, p. 520. On the south slope of Knob Mountain, ::::
near Tazewell, are two large sinkhole entrances about 1000
feet anart. The easternmost entrance is "#1", and takes the form
of 3 large openings into a single room which slopes downward
through bare limestone 100 feet to a 10 foot drop. This room
is known as "Devil's slide". Below the 10 foot dron is a small
rubble-floored room with a fissure in the far end which opens
into the top of a 128 foot drop.
