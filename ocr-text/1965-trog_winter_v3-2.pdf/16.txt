of the Speleograph, pi 70-72 (Editor's Note: the article
referred to is reproduced without John Holsinger's consent
immediately after this letter), I discussed both Caldwell and
Honacker Caves and tried to clarify some of the confusion
created in this area both bb Davies and Cooper. Apparently
you didn't see this article when you wrote your recent one.
My article was entitled "Notes on some little known caves: in
Mercer County, West Virginia." It also contains information
on some other oaves relatively close to your area so you might
find it. worthwhile to consult. If you don't have back issues
of the Speleograph, you can wrtie to Henry Douglas or Lyle
Conrad and request this particular one. If it's out of print
maybe you can get Henry to send you a xerox cópy.
. Re: Virginia Cave Survey--I will soon put an article
in the NSS NEWS stressing the need for continued data on
Virginia caves. We are planning a supplement to follow the new
book in about 5 to 6 years. We already have a good file
started on caves in the far reaches of SW Vạ. (e.g. Lee, Scott,
Russell, Tazewell, etc.). The. Bland Co. area, which you re-
ferred to in your recent issue, is another area which needs
much work. I'm glad to see that some of you are doing some -
thing abaut it. The Newberry-Bane area is especially nromising
as you are undoubtedly aware. To Save time later, copies of
all information on new caves, old caves, cave maps, and lo-
cations should be sent to Henry Douglas so that they can be
placed in the supplement files. Another area that needs
some further work is. Cr ig County. In addition, many of the
caves renorted in the Cave of Virginia need mapping; many
of the leads reported there should be followed--some, I
imagine, will yield new and interesting results. We now have
Around 175 caves in Lee Co. and still have leads to check
out. Good luck in Bland County,
Give Gregg my regards if ho is still around. ...

NOTES ON SOME LITTLE KNOWN CAVES IN MERCER COINTY, WEST
VIRGINIA. By John R. Holsinger.
On Labor Day weekend, September 1-2, 1962, the writer
and Kitty Flick visited several Virginia (Tazewell County)
and West Virginia (Monroe and Mercer Counties) in search of
cavernicolous fauna. With the excention of the well known
Greenville Saltpeter Cave in Monroe County, the other West
Virginia caves encountered on the trip are believed to be
only vaguely known and probably inadequately explored. In
spite of the fact that this was principally a biological
