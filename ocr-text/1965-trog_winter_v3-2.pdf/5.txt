with a locking karabiner.) The belayer grips the rope firmly
and brings his braking hand across in front of him, so that
there will be no delay in catching the trainee, Actually, the
trainee is already caught. The only remaning variable is
whether or not he reaches the end of the belay rope.
The trainee then begins to rappel in the usual manner,
the only difference being tat his chest prusik is on another
rope. He will then reach the end of the rappel rope, and go
into an uncontrolled free fall, which he must stop by means
of his chest prusik. If he doesn't, the belay rope will take
over, stopping him a safe distance from the bottom. He then
rigs into rappel on the long rope; and either releases him-
self from the hung chest prusik, or is housted with the belay
rope (by 2 or more people at the top) for enough to release
his chest prusik.

The belayer should be in an excellent position, well
braced and anchored, and should use plenty of padding. He
must be experienced and dependable at the dynamic belay, since
he will probably get frequent, regular, and hard use in this
rig.
The instinct to grab onto something when falling is very
strong. During the only use of this rig, five experienced
caver's tried it out. Only two let go of their chest prusik
on the first drop. The other three panicked in various degrees,
freezing on the rope.
If this can be taken as a valid sample, it means that
there has been a better than even chance that the same type
of accident would have occured iad an unbelayed rappel gone
out of control and the caver had to stop on his chest prusik,
This is NOT the fault of the chest prusik; rather, it is
to be blamed on inaduqua te training. The trainee has, in
effect, been told "This is a chest prusik. It is used to
stop a rappel that gets out of control. Do no let go :of it;
for if you do, it will immediately jam (which is what it is
made for), and you must then go through an inconvenient pro--
cedure to loosen it."
No training in the actual use of the chest prusik to stop
a fall is given. Consequently the trainee has no idea of
what his reactions will be, or just how hard it can be to let
go. And the chest prusik is obviously (as this accident so
plainly shows) useless unless let go of at the right time.
Training on this rig should be required for any caver or
climber who rappels using a chest prusik as a safety--training
until the reaction of letting go of a chest prusik in a fall
becomes just as instinctive as the normal reaction to grab on.
