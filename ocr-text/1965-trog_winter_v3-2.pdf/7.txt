CONDENSED NEWS ITEMS FROM EXCHANGE PUBLICATIONS
Vol. 1, No. 1 of the NEOG LOG claims on page five that
whipping nyíon ropes with small twine is about as unsatis-
factory as taping the ends with friction tape, Somehow, we
have been phenomenally fortunate that none of our ropes have
come unwhipped, since we have been using twine for about 20.
years. However, the LOG states that melting about 12" of
the end of the rope and twisting it into a solid conical piece
is the best method.

Vol.7, No. 7 of the BGN (Baltimore Grotto News to you new
members) has an article by Bill Plummer (po 198) offering
constructive suggestions for making the NSS more attractive
to non-members. They are (a) an improved monthly newsletter,
(b) an improved journal, (c) an improved series of slide-
lectures, (a) expeditions, (e) lower rates for associate mem-
bers, and (f) creation of more realistic.caving literature.
Sounds good to us.
Vol. 7, No. 8 of the POTOMAC CAVER contains a semi-
ficticuous article by Pete Grant on the Newberry accident.
(For an accurate account, see Vol. 3, No. 1 of the TECH
TROGLODYTE). VPI cayers continue to be amused by the inac-
curate articles printed about this incident, Mr. Grant's
article claims that Ellen's fall was a result of having too
little friction on her single brake' bar rig; and uses this
false premise as a basis to attack the use of them. As a user
of the "SBB" for the last two years, I have no burns, blisters,
worn gloves; or broken bones. All I have is a deeply-grooved,
single brake bar
We finally found a factual account of the incident on
page 169 of Vol. 12, No. 8 of the NITTANY GROTTO NEWS. Con-
gratulations, Bill Russell and Nick Lambert!
Vol. 5, No. 8 of the HUNTSVILLE GROTTO NEWSLETTER bemoans
the failure of grotto publications to convey a true impression
of a grotto, mainly because many of the people influential
in grotto affairs are never mentioned, and many grotto ac-
tivities never find their way into the newsletter.
