EDITORIS COLUMN
It looks as though itis Gary's turn to take it easy.
and let me write the Trog...er, the Editors Column. This
year, the V.P.I. Grotto has received a flood of new
members. In fact the newcomers far outnumber the remaining
old members. Also, as you may have noticed on the cover,
one of the Grotto offices has changed hands. Craig Peters
is now the Grotto secretary. Craig has also taken it
upon himself to head up the old Patch Committee... This
committee has been around so long it is almost a standing
committee. But with Peters on the job, the club con look
for a patch before, say, next June. The patch will feature
the hairy ape pictured on the cover.
So much for news within the Grotto. Now I would like
to say a few words about the Troglodyte... You may have
noticed somewhat of a difference between Vol. III and the
preceeding two volumes. The biggest difference was a
lowering of standards. We do not claim to be what we
used to be. However, if it is found that Gary and I are
somewhat highly opinionated or critical of ours or any
other Grotto, we will, welcome 'any â€¢riticisim. "**'.
. We will, of course, continue to print accounts of
trips made by the club, whether they be club or contraband
trips. The articles, for the most part, will be poorly
written and contain profuse grammatical and typograph-
ical errors. Gary and I do not intend to extend any
apologies for this, nor do we expect to win any awards
for our journalisim. Now that we have established this
understanding, we will open our pages to articles written
by Grotto members. Having thus lowered our standards to
the point of obscurity if not oblivion, we will base :
whether or not an article is published solely upon whether
or not Gary and I agree with it. Unless, of course, it
comes to the point of having to fill up space. (And
we've got plenty of that:)
It is highly improbable that any of the articles
found herein will contain anything of scientific intrest,
even though scientific intellegence was used in writing a
few of them. Any outlandish or invalid statements made
herein are due to ignorance on the part of the author,
not the Grotto or any of its members. Bear in mind that
we still hold the undisputed title of "World's Most
Active Caving Organization!! Any dissenters or disbelievers ?
Unless you know of another Grotto that averages at least
three trips per week, then don't bother.
