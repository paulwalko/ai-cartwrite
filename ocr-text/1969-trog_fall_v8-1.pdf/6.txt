WHY A TRAINEE PROGRAM?
As people on campus start appearing with wooden
plaques, draped around-their necks and bags of candy in their
hands, one sometimes hears the question, "Why doesn't the
Cave Club do something like that?" The answer, of course,
lies in our name. Whether you choose to call us the Cave
Club or the VPI Grotto, NSS, we are a caving organization,
and all of our recruitment and training efforts must be
directed towards that end. A pledge system does not teach
people how to cave safely, nor would outlandish initiation
procedures, However, we do have a system that makes people
dia. some work to become members, while teaching them something
at the same time. This is what is known as our "trainee
system;" In general, it provides an opportunity for prospective
members to show that they at least meet our standards for
membership and, if they do not, it gives them a chance to
learn. Now that we have seen the basics, let's look at..
it in a little more detail.
In our system, a prospective member is first required
to cave with the club for a minimum of forty hours. This,
frankly is to make sure a person wants to stick to caving
as: a sport, as well as to insure a minimum amount of experience,
A person who has no interest in speleology, but merely
wants to collect a patch, is wasting his time as well as
ours. If you want patches, join the army, not the Cave Club.
We require that a person have a "working knowledge".
of belaying. This means that you should definitely know
how and be able to catch a person if he falls off a ladder
or traverse. When you belay a person, you are the only
thing between the climber and a funeral if he slips.
For this reason, evaluation of belaying ability must be
honest and factual; no personal sympathy can be allowed.
You may have to depend on that person sometime,
Rappeling, climbing and prussiking must be done
in a cave for Cave Club credit. This, again, is to insure
that the trainee can do these things under cave conditions,
and not on cliff faces outside a cave where conditions
usually are a good deal better than those in a cave...
We are not specifying distances in rappeling because it is:
up to the individual member's judgement as to whether a
person's qualifications are good enough for membership,
Although many, including myself, like for a person to :
prussik a one hundred foot drop at least once before coming
up for membership, it must be admitted that a trainee can
show whether or not he has the ability to prussik on somewhat
shorter drops. The deciding factor in any case is the
standard by which the member judges prussiking. In all
cases it must be kept reasonably high,
