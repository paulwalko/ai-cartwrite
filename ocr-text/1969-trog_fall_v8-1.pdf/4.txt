FALL
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1969
Apathy, according to Webster, is "1: lack of feeling or
emotion, 2: lack of interest or concern." Think about it,
Think about a club meeting when there was a job to be done
or a committee that needed a chairman, Did you say you ..
would do the job? If so, then I'm not aiming this article at
'you. If you did not say anything, just sat there and thought
"someone else will do it.", then you are the one I want to
reach. Impassiveness is one of the main enemies of any
organization. Without interest in the club it will die (or
at best, go into hibernation).. There are organizations that
I know about, and probably you too, that have folded for this
very same reason. Specifically, there was a grotto that
folded when their main concern became partying instead of
caving, which is supposed to be our primary interest, The
problem that we have in the club is a pathy and trying to
overcome it is something that should concern each and every-
one of us.
The solution to this problem is one that everyone is
going to have to work out in his own way. I suggest going
caving, but more than that, working at something when you do
g√∂ caving: conservation, mapping, land owner relations, or
anything related to the club and its activities, I found
that sport caving lost some of its appeal after a while, and
subsequently I started mapping or some other work related to
caving. If sport caving is all you like and want to do,
that's fine and dandy, I'm not condemning or belittling
any ditowho primarily goes caving for the fun of it. But if
caving has lost some of its appeal, try workingi Try going
on a trip that is going to be mapping, doing conservation
or something on that order; trying to open closed caves and
improving land owner relations is a job that needs people
desperately. '. Do something, you may find that the rewards
are more than you would expect.
What I suggested in the previous paragraph should
help some of you despondent members. The best way to inspire
interest in the club, however, is through the trainees,
These people are new, interested and most of them really
want to know what this activity is all about, But, I think
that they have gotten the wrong impression of our olub, and
at lot of them come to the meetings strictly for the party
afterwards. These trainees are the growth potential for our
club, and I think the overexposure to partying, socializing
and the like, is not only detrimental to ourselves as a
grotto, but also to the trainees and even to the regional
and national organizations to which we belongi
This is what has happened to the club as I see it.
We have moved from an organization with caving and speleology
as our main concern, to one with socializing as our primary
interest. To those whose first and/or only interest is
partying, I would say that if that's what you are looking for,
go find someone else because we are not the one you want.
