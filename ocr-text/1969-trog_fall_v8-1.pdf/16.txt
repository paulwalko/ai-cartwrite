Hi Y'all!
How would you like to come to our perfect cave?
A perfect cave-what's that?--foam rubber crawlways, 600 foot
rappells with back door exits, 25 foot soda straws, and pay
toilets. Sounds great doesn't it? But that's not all:
the exit is only 500 feet by aerial tramway to Uncle Bill's
Still on the Hill.
Seriously though, if you can make it over Blacksburg
way stop in and see us anytime! Just call 552-0040 and
ask for Mike, or 552-4993 and ask for 36-24-35 and we'll
tell you where to find us. If you want unusual meeting,
super parties and push-push caving, see you soon!
VPI'S PERFECT CAVE
