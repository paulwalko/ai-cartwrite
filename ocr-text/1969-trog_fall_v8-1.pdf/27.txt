FALL
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1969
I questioned Mike if this hole had a name, Getting
a somewhat negative answer, I suggested calling it the Peach
Pit, No one seemed too enthusiastic about this, and as a
matter of fact, the name was in imminent danger of being
tossed down the newly named drop. It got even worse when
down at the bottom of that pit, I offered calling the second
drop the Prune Pit, (on a subsequent trip this drop was
renamed Janet's Pit, after a certain clumsy and troublesome
girl who smashed up her knee while chimneying down to the
drop, thus cutting short. a mapping trip.) . Anyway, the
engineers. were designing a set up so two people could be on
the rope at once, thus speeding up the job of getting every-
one up both drops.
Down in the main lower passage. we worked our way down
gradually, accomplishing all sorts of heroic feats as scramb-
ling, walking, jumping into streams, (falling in my case),
crawling, clinbing, etc. Off on the side someone discovered
a mutilated peice of metal that looked as if it had been
attacked by a fleet of Mack trucks. Considering that we
were somewhat off the local truck route, it was evident that
the aluminum pail had been mangled by the raging torrents
of lowest Hig. Pleasant thoughts, .
... Anyway, while taking a breather Mike asked Gene what
would he do (concerning a rescue) if someone, then pointing
at me, broke a leg' right there, After going into all sorts
of procedure and "Gruesome Rescues I Have Known", he con-
cluded that it would be a helluva lot simpler to utilize one
of the essential items of a rescue kit, namely a .45. The
reasoning was that one could go about recovering the victim
at one's leisure, Needless to say, I was being very careful
not to do myself any serious bodily injury.
After checking just about every hole, crack and side
lead, it was concluded that there wasn't a whole lot down
there that had not been seen before,. But this wasn't too
disappointing considering that there were some unchecked
drops in the breakdown room, We reached what was. believed
to be the lowest stream level and I got the impression that
there wasn't any future in pushing it further,
Starting back out we retraced the pattern of antics
to the bottom of the Prune Pit. Like most cavers I have
pretty good faith in nylon webbing, but this should not be
disillusioning. When Mike was about two thirds up the drop,
a large string of Polish obscenities rang out, and was inmed-
iately followed by the lower portion of a Jumar sling
hitting the ground. But somehow, with pieces of string,
chewing gum, and other things Polacks usually have with them,
he was able to get up to the ledge. This makes one wonder
how often people check out the strength of their slings,
