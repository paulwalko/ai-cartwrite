categorized in between these two extremes but the point is
keeping your rope from these demons will certainly prolong
the life of the rope and will increase your safety margin
no matter what type of rope you may be using.
Judgement in rigging the drop will provide the rope
with its best natural protection but usually some sort of
padding is in order. Perhaps the simplest method of padding
is to wrap some material, i.e, cloth, burlap, etc., around
that portion of the rope that rubs against the wall or break-
over. This will do the job but offers disadvantages. The
pad probably will not stay in place and it may be difficult
to go: over, particularly if it is long.
Some cavers slit a section of garden hose and slip it
onto the rope where it may be needed. This will probably stay
on better but it too may be difficult to get over while
prussiking or while on rappel.
Perhaps the best rope pad is made such as, to be tied
onto the standing line in a prussik knot fashion,. (See ...
exemple 2) The pad may be made of cloth or burlap but the
longest-lasting and most effective material is heavy leather.
This may be impractical if the drop is deep inside the cave
where the additional weight and bulkiness may be disadvan-
tageous, One-quarter inch sling rope (synthetic type is
best) is attached to the pad in two corners of one of the
shorter edges. The sling rope is then, in turn, attached to
the main line by means of a prussik knot, Once attached,
the pad's position may easily be adjusted and the pad
tightened to stay in place. The pad may be made in any
length to accomodate the drop. The width can be kept to a
minimun, usually on the order of 10-12 inches, to allow for
some rope displacement. This pad is easy to go over. With
Jumars one may simply clip over the knot but it is easy to
slide the knot, ahead or behind you. The length of the sling
rope should be fairly long (3-4 feet from pad to'knot) to.
