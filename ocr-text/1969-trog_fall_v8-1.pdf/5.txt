To the others who have seemed to have forgotten the other
areas encompassed by the Cave Club, I suggest that you stop
and take a look at yourself and the club.. Then move in the
direction that you feel is the best for both the grotto and
yourself,
I know that there is a problem in the club at the
present time and I feel that this article brings it out into
the open, if not, then: let's hear from someone else. If we
fail, or are afraid to recognize our deficiencies and troubles
then the club is on the way out. In any event, let's make the
VPI Cave Club back into the most active caving organization
in the world, we have the personnel and I know we can.
Let's do it NOW!

EDITOR'S COLUMN
For some reason there seems to be little enthusiasum
shown towards The Tech Troglodyte until the last few .
weeks until it is printed. When this enthusiasum does
appear it seems to be the type of enthusiasum that advocates
getting the job done no matter how sloppy the end product,
Now I am not saying that all the errors that a journal
of this sort has should be blamed on the haste in which it is
compiled. A lot of the blame lies on me, the editor,
The editor of a publication such as this should have
a very well organized staff. He should promote general
interest in the publication and keep this interest on a high
level all the time. The editor should have a very good
knowledge of the fundamentals of managing a publication,
The editor should be imaginative, creative, and orginal,
The only trouble with all of the above statements is that
there are very few people who display them.
Fortunately there is still someone who will take
the job of editorship when it is vacant; most of these people
turn out to be good editors. The point: I am trying to make
i's this,'. Try to put yourself in the editor's'place, find
out what he has to do to get out your publication, and
next time it doesn't come out on time find out. why instead
of complaining. "People who live in glass houses shouldn't
throw stones,"
