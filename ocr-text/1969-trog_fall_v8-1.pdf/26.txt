FIRST TRIP TO HIGGENBOTHAM'S #2
or
HOW TO GO CAVING WITH NOTHING TO DO
AND GET IT ONLY HALF DONE*
Higgenbotham's #2 of Tazewell County has a reputation,
It seems that about 60 years ago a local news paper reported
that a flashflood had been diverted by a big deep hole in the
ground (Hig-2), thus saving the countryside from a raging
torrent, whether this noble deed can be attributed to this
modest cave, or the local journalists had a fieldday of story-
telling, is not known for sure. But at any rate, this cave
has been pretty much steered clear of by cavers. This trip
was originally designed to continue some survey work started
the year before, but this plan (due mainly to a late start)
was eventually scrapped. So the crew, consisting of Gene
("Mon") Harrison, Gary ("Gary Moss") Moss, Mike("The Guru")
Kayes and I decided to take a leisure trip to the lowest
section and do a little exploring.
The owner told us of some people down the hill who had
been drilling a well recently. A problem arose when, several
hundred feet down, the drill bit fell out and into a 14 foot
cavity. Verrry Interesting. So, while playing around with
the farmer's dog and making faces at his cows, we figured out
that it could be very possible and very profitable if we, came
across a certain piece of valuable equipment, Gene, being
the late Safety Director of the Club, said that it would be
feasible to run a rescue for the drill bit, providing, of
course, that we could find it, (For those with adventure in
their hearts and money on their minds, we haven't found it
yet.)
Finally, after a good bit of tail dragging, we rigged
the entrance with Mike's 200+ and rappelled on in. The
entrance is a total of 168 feet, offset by a 30 foot drop,
It seems to be a rule of thumb in this cave that where you
find one pit, you will usually find another just below it.
While the guys were touring the large breakdown room,
which is scattered with 90 or so foot pits, I did a little
sightseeing on my own, I came across a rather large log
wedged straight up in a crevase. It made me wonder about
the authenticity of the flood story and also if there was any
rain forcast. Anyway, we rigged the next drop which was close
to 100 feet with Gary's 250. So much rope was needed be-
cause below this one is another drop which goes down another
75 feet. With this, I got a first hand demonstration of the
Harrison way to rig a drop using miles of rope, (I have
always wondered how one hogties a 30 ton rock.) But, I can
say that I really did have confidence that the knots would hold
in
*This appears to be a completely illogical statement,
but when caving with an illogically logical person like Mike
Kayes, it somehow makes sense.
