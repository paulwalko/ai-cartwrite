A COURSE IN. VERTICAL TECHNIQUES
In the course of the last several years I have become
interested in various aspects of training courses designed
to introduce novices to the sport of caving, I have been in
frequent contact with "Blinker" Glock in pursuit of ideas
concerned with this matter, Doug Perkins, the vice-president
of this grotto, and R.E, Whittemore, a past vice-president,
The ideas that have been presented vary, but all agree that
extensive training in the form of supervised caving presents
the best means of aiding a developing caver,
One aspect that has drawn my special attention has
been the training of novices in the use of vertical equip-
ment and techniques. I have an affinity for vertical work,
hence this special interest, I am willing to go vertical
caving frequently, and, when not involved in underground.
activities, I frequently find a few people of like inclination
and go somewhere to play around on the ropes, The "I's" of
this introduction should warn the reader that the individual
behind this typewriter has a definite prejudice toward ver-
tical caving, and this article may be read with this in mind,
However, it is intended that a viable plan of training be set
forth for grottos that are primarily horizontal in their
activities, as well as for those who do a great deal of
vertical caving.
The 1965 edition of the Speleo Digest contains' three
very interesting articles that suggest two extremes of
philosophy for cavers, and a middle ground. The articles are
"What Verticle Caving Techniques are suitable for the Average
Caver?". by Ross Eckler (p3-13), "Ladders or Leaders?" by Bill
Plummer (p3-17), and "The Quest for a Vertical Hero" by Ed
Yarbrough (p3-19). These present what Mr. Eckler calls "the
Joe Caver-Roper Technique dilemma. There are two types of
cavers, he states, that lie at opposite poles in the caving
world: horizontal types, or Joe Cavers who just want to get
into a cave and around in it with the minimum of trouble, and
vertical people, or Roper Techniques, who are happiest with a
cave that has a pit, or several pits to challenge them. Mr.
Plummer. opposes Mr, Eckler, as a Roper Technique, as opposed
to a Joe Caver. Mr Yarbrough seems to prefer a middle ground
between the two,
The Joe Cavers, postulates Mr. Eckler, rate their tech-
niques for vertical caving according to the following order of
values:
1. Safety;
2. Convenience of use of a particular technique;
3.. Ease of learning;
4. Rapidity of ascent and descent;
5. Cost of equipment;
6. Weight of equipment,
