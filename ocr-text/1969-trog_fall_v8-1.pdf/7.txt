Knots and their uses must, of course, be known
perfectly. By this I don't mean being able to tie them
right the first time every time, but the trainee should be
able to catch his own mistake if he makes one in tying a
knot and correct it without being told to do so by the tester, .
I personally like to get prospective members to tie their :
knots. at randomly selected times (like at dinner, etc.) so
as to reduce the chance of some just memorizing them for the
test and forgetting them later, one must know how to tie the
knots at any given time in the cave and should know them thor-
oughly before becoming a member as well.
The conservation requirement is now on the trainee
sheet in order that the new member will better appreciate the
need to practice conservation while caving. It also gives us
a source of manpower for cleaning up the more heavily
traveled caves in the area. This, of course, is not something
done just by trainees. Members, too, accompany these trips to
lend a hand. In short, it is useful work that must be done
every so often in a great many caves. Also, we are now trying
to: impress upon all cavers, both old and new, the importance
of land-owner relations.
.: The trainee and carbide lamp. tests let us know what
the trainée“ doesn't know, If enough questions are missed in
the equipment, techniques, and safety sections, further train-
ing is usually recommended. However, the test is mostly to
give us an idea of what people have picked up in the way of
caving knowledge during the time that they were trainees,
Hopefully, taking the test will be a learning experience,
with it providing an opportunity to learn a few new things,
I have even learned things from some of the people taking the
test,
As you have now seen, most of the trainee requirements
deal with learning, the skills of caving. This is necessary
if we are to remain one of the best grottos in the world. We
are in the position of having to train most of our new members
from scratch. In the past, we have done an amazing job. We
can in the future, too, but the future rests on us today. If
We maintain high standards for the people coming in today,
then we can be sure that they will be as proud of becoming
members as we were when we came in, and that VPI will retain
the title as "The world's most active caving organization,"
