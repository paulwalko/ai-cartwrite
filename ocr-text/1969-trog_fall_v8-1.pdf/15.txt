NEWBERRY'S OR DINGLEBERRIES
On October 25, 1969 the infamous Steve Hall, better
known as "Pig Pen", the dynamic duo, Danny and Lynn, Jack
O'mera of "Friggin' Falcon" fame and I, "Apple Jack", pro-
ceeded to discover and exploit the mysterious hole in the
Triple Wells. We were not yet in the cave when the first
disaster struck. The dynamic duo had a quick change of
plans as the fearless captain's lamp blew its bottom.
Undaunted, Danny proceeded with the order, "give me your
lamp woman!"
After entering the cave we reached the Triple Wells
in no time. Danny the fearless was the first to decend and
he went over the brink screaming in aspiral of speed,
the reverberations of which were heard for the next five
minutes. He discovered the mysterious hole but was unable
to reach it due to the foreboding width of the well, In no
time "Hell bent Hall" was down the rope glarring into the
dark hole. His team mate now: on the bottom pulled the rope
from side to side to help fling his companion into the hole,
"Hell bent Hall" growing dizzy thrust his body into the hole
in a last desperate effort. Danny on the bottom and Oimera
and myself still at the top waited in suspense. The hole
went al√≠ of seven feet!
Still unsatisfied we regrouped (except for Jack who
was to meet us at the top of the straddle pit) and sought
further adventure. We went up the Devil's Staircase after
rescuing remains of a dead fish the odor of which sped us
swiftly on our way.
. Our next challenge was the Wimper Point. which
is a darring traverse at the top of the 140 foot Straddle Pit,
Danny was the first and proceeded fearlessly across in
no time, Hall was next and after a wimper or two because his
arms were too short he made it. I, after refusing at first
to make the darring ascent, proceeded with no dificulty.
We had been the third, fourth, and fifth persons ever to
make the traverse with the help of Jack who belayed us from
the top.
At this polnt the party regrouped. Since the most
dangerous parts of the cave had been challenged we proceeded
with great speed, driven on by the dynamic duo -1, Danny.
It seems another odor was soon to errupt with disasterous
results. As Danny passed overhead on the chimney out we
noticed the tell' tale spot on the seat of his pants. Yes,
the Greenbriar Two Step had struck again. As he ran down
the mountain we heard him yell, "Get the T.P. woman!"
One question still remains unanswered, was it
Newberry's or dingleberries that drove our fearless leader,
Danny, onward,
