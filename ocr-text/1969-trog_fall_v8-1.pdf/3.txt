THE VPI CAVE CLUB-THE MOST ACTIVE CAVING ORGANIZATION
IN THE WORLD. That's what we're supposed to be. Most active
caving organization--active in what? Do we really do more
caving than anyone else or do we do more partying? The
purpose of the Club is "to promote interest in, and to
advance the science of speleology; to encourage fellowship
among those interested in spelunking; and to promote
conservation and safety." If you are wondering where I
found these words of wisdom, they are right on the front
page of the Cave Club's constitution, you don't even have
to read the whole thing, just half of the front page.
I want to say a few things about the change in the
club since I came to VPI, but more than that I want to
point out to you, the club members, the problem which is
present in the club at this time, when I sme to VPI
the Cave Club was the most active caving organization in :
the world... Sure, we had Friday night "speleo-seminars".
(and there were some good ones), but the club as a whole
put in more hours underground in one quarter than we have
in the past two. There is a big difference in the Cave Club
then and the cave club now; there was a lot more activity
in caving and cave related areas, People were always
doing something and did not live for the Friday night
"orgy"; and I think that more people now are interested
in promoting fellowship (which is good to a certain extent)
rather than caving, speleology, conservation and safety.
In other words, this "most active caving organization
in the world has turned in to the most active socializing
organization in the world. Even with this, the parties, or
whatever you want to call them, have become an all-out,
raise hell, beat Hem up drunk. The parties of a few years
ago were very nice: we sang, got drunk and had a very
good time. After the guitar playing stopped, people had
a chance to sit and talk, plan trips for the next day and
tell war stories, or whatever they wanted to do, as long as
they did not disturb the others at the gathering. Now the
noise is so loud, you can't even hear yourself think, and
there is absolutely no respect for any of the other people
present, Stealing of food and drinks, destruction of
property and the general "I don't give a damn" attitude is
the feeling that seems to prevail at most of our gatherings.
Naturally, what I'm saying in this article does not apply
to everyone in the club. There are a few members who still
go caving and work and care, but the few are lost in the
many. Consequently, the many supress the few, the end
result being a back up in the system. When this occurs,
nothing gets accomplished and apathy sets in,
