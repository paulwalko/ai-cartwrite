THE
FALL
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1969.
Out came the chains. Hixson put them on the front wheels
in order to get maximum traction from the front wheel
drive unit, Boy, did he get it! Power!
He backed into the tree behind the truck, When it
did not move, he hit it again, harder, harder. The tree
didn't break (tough little 3,0,B.) but the truck did,
The front wheels stopped turning and it became apparent
that the habs had sheared off from the force of hitting
the tree with chains on the tires, "It's getting grin;"
remarked Young. Hixson ignored him as he went behind a
tree to releive the tension,
"And Clifford and Boots are a leaving..."
Now that there were only five of us left, the
desparation moves began, Putting the chains on the rear
wheels had allowed us to dig beautiful ruts in the ground,
but the truck hadn't moved. Now, by jacking up the truck,
which wils Ed Loud's favorite job, and thenpushing it off
the jack, we manged to get the truck into a position where
we could use the winch. The truck then pulled itself around
180Â° until it was pointing uphill, facing the road. The cable
on the winch would hold no more, however, and the crew
prepared to spend the night..
. .. "How long do you think it will take Boots and Clifford
to hike 20 miles?"........."%%#%#%#$%$!." "Five people in a
pickup cab!"............:"Move over and give me some $%#&$#
room, Young!".............."It's only 12 hours till morning."
And it rained.
After four hours of this sort of thing, Mike finally
returned. He had found a local man with a pick-up truck;
who had driven up to within about a mile of where we were,
We hiked down and froze back to Ducktown in the back of the
truck to a belated spaghetti dinner.
The next day, Jim got another 150 feet of cable for
the winch and up the mountain and through the woods went
the "Rocket" and the Chuckwagon;" We hiked up to the truck
again and put the new cable on the winch, Hixson cranked
up the truck and.....,"the gears on his winch are a strippin',"
Back we came to Ducktown, after literally pushing
found a fellow with a jeep, got a block and tackle, and
using the jeep, pulled the truck back onto the road,
but it was apparent to all that Henry had croaked on
Big Frog Mountain,
"Will he ever return........."
