- THIE TECH TROGLODYTE.
ODYLE,
1969
We note first that safety is paramount. Mr. Plummer offers
a slightly revised order of values, but he agrees that safety
is supreme in any order that may be chosen, He observes,
"Danger is to be met with respect. Beginners in one's
care should be taught that respect, and the necessary
knowledge."
Mr. Eckler notes that
"Both rappeling and prussiking, can be terribly unfor-
giving' of apparently small mistakes by the less
experienced caver,"
It may be stated that "vertical caving", rather than just the
techniques of rappeling and prussiking can be "terribly, unfor-
giving" for novices. It may be stated as well, however, that
crossing a street can be equally unforgiving of small mistakes
as in not taking the precaution of looking. Mr. Yarbrough,
Mr, Eckler; and Mr. Plummer debate the question of ladders
versus rope, and vertical caver versus horizontal caver, and
compromises between the two extremes. They do not, however,
note the importance of training as fully as perhaps should be
done,
foss Eckler states that Joe Caver is
"...not interested in practicing techniques... once or
twice a year. He is likely to prefer techniques which
require a minimum of learning."
By implication, Joe" Caver has no basic interest: in vertical:
techniques, Mr, Eckler states that pits are an inconvenience
to these folk, and suggests that vertical training be reduced
to ladder technique, Â· Mr. Plummer holds out for the use of
rope exclusively, countering the argument of difficulty of
mastery of techniques by stating,
. "If Joe Caver is not suited for vertical techniques
early in his career, he may well be later."
He suggests that Joe Cavers have a close connection to the
Roper Techniques in that eventually the average caver will
blend the two extremes to achieve a happy medium,
Mr. Yarbrough seeks this middle ground by suggesting
that the caves of a particular area dictate the kind of
training given the cavers of that region. He asserts, .
"It seems obvious that if a vertical technique has
worked well for one man it will, with a few adapta-
tions, work reasonably well for anyone, Work well'.
means not only effectively but safely."
