program of training.
The descending gear is even less standard, with half .
a dozen ways to get down a pit or slope in current use in the
Grotto activities. The basis of the gear and training is.
double brake bars, that seem to lend themselves in the safest
manner. Thorough testing of ropes, rigging, belay from below,
(NOT the use of a belay from above), and checking of the
novices as they rig in makes the training safe, and instills
a sense of caution. As in the case of prussiking, the novice
will note the gadgets used by others around him, and will ask
for a demonstration and instruction in their use.
It has been noted thus far that the group involved
here is one of some size, and thus the instruction is readily
available in many forms. With the case of the small group,
the situation is much the same as far as study of basic, tech-
niques is concerned, with the adaptation of "standard" pro-
cedures coming first. The choice of a "Standard" procedure
is made on the grounds of safety, ease of learning and use:,
with rapid ascent or descent more or less disregarded.
The point of speed is made frequently in caving,
especially in pit caving: the faster one can get up or down
a dr√∂p, the better, seems to be the current fallacy. The
method for moving up or down a rope should be chosen along
lines of convenience and adaptability to the individual..
One should be able to move down a rope at a firmly controlled
speed, and with a smooth steady motion. The man who flies
down hell-bent-for-election is all too likely to loose con-
trol. In climbing up a rope, or a ladder, it is important
that a fairly expedient method is chosen, in order to move
the group with a minimum of waiting. As in the case of rap-
pelling; however, the goal should be that of smooth, steady
motion with a minimum of stopping and resting. Those who
climb in short bursts of speed, and then collapse period-
ically to rest are more likely to delay the party than the
man who climbs steadily, although at a slower rate;
The point of all the emphasis of choosing both rope
and ladder training is to allow the use of both in some
caves, or to vary rigging to fit the situation. At VPI,
drops of up to about sixty feet are commonly rigged with
cable, while deeper drops are accorded rope. The members are
capable of using both, although the prejudices draw lines for
and against rope only, or ladder only. Adaptability, however,
demands that lines of prejudice for a particular method be
dispensed with, in order that the cave be explored with the
greatest ease. No one method may be chosen, for the reason
that no one condition prevails in any cave, or in any one
area, The capability of the caver to adapt his training and
skills will greatly enhance both his safety and his enjoyment
of the underground.
