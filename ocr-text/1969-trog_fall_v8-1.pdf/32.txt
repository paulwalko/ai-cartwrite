Right! I pushed away from the rock face with my feet
and started down, listening to the soft whirr of the rope as
it shot through the "biners".
9:"WOW!" I shouted. Something happened to me, I felt a
sudden thrill rush through my whole being. I went faster -
complete confidence was mine, Pulling back on the rope, I
stopped instantly, swinging like a pendulum 150 feet from
the floor with at least 300 feet of space reaching to the
ceiling above me, : I looked down. Tiny specks of light
pierced the darkness. My mind bent. I released tension on
the rope, barreling through the timeless air, watching the
lights grow nearer and nearer.
"It's wonderful!"
for what I did.
I yelled, stimulated by a passion
The rocks approached and all to soon I slowed myself
to a stop on the floor of the cave.
.: The carabiners and brake bars, hot from the friction of
the long rappell, opened finally, releasing the rope. The :
last person rappelled down in grand style - non-stop and with
no tension until about 10 feet from the floor.
"Hey," someone suggested, "let's blow out all the lamps,"
So we did. And all around me there was black, complete
absence of light, And I knew, I knew why I was there, at
the bottom of "the 180". as it was called. It struck me
suddenly, as loud as "silent flowers" and my mind rested with
an overwhelming sensation of serene peace,

HOW TO REDUCE ROPE ABRASION BY PADDING
There is no rope currently available that completely
resists abrasion. Some ropes resist wear and tear better
than others. In general, synthetic ropes resist abrasion
better than those made of natural fibers. Also. laid ropes
wear better than braided or plaited ropes and ropes whose
fibers are tightly woven are more abrasion resistant than
"soft" ropes. There are three ina jor ways to abrade a rope.
The first way is running a rope over objects that create a
bend in the rope, (See example Â· 1) - The number and degree of
e's one puts in the rope depends on the method of rigging
the rope and the method of descent and ascent. This is ex-
cluded from this discussion. The second way of abrasion is
running a rope over rough surfaces. This is usually
