adjustable. "V" ring, and pulls, This tightens the system
around the user. If it is desired to loosen the harness,
the adjustable "V" ring is pulled in the oposite direction.
After the completion of the first Maidenform (Mark Two),
there was a "tail" of about six inches hanging out of the
adjustable ring, when four feet of nylon webbing were used.
If anyone's chest is larger than thirty-six inches, thought
might be given to using a longer piece of webbing.
Tests of the harness have indicated that it lends
itself well to the continual adjustment involved in the
search for the "easier way" to get up a rope, A number
of models of the Maidenform (Mark Two) have been used by
members of the VPI Grotto for both personal use, and training
equipment for novices learning ropework. The ease of adjustment
and; use makes the harness a good tool for use in getting
up a drop. The Maidenform Mgf. Ço, is still testing and
refining the harness. Someday, we will find the perfect
chest harness. Until then, however, the Maidenform (Mark Two)
Chest Harness is a fair compromise.

THIS IS GEORGIA ROUTE TWO
-OR-
THE DAY HENRY CRCAKED
"Let's go tour wheeling up Big Frog Mountain," said
Jim Hixson, Mike Clifford, Doug Perkins, Ed Loud, and
Bill Douty agreed, and left. Boots Good with no alternative
but to go, Jim young expressed his doubts but then, it
would just be a short trip, so....
Up the mountain and through the woods to the steep
hill we go. Here Hixson first used the winch, and here the
cable first broke. But by and by he winched his way to the
top of the steep hill and proceeded onward, until he made
a wrong turn and found the road blocked by a tree. Hixson
backed up... into another tree, and jammed the side of the
cab next to another tree for good measure, what masterful
driving would it take to get us out of this one? Who would
do it? But seven logical people should be able to figure
out how to back a truck out of a level place that it drove into.
An hour of thinking, drinking and manuvering did the trick,
The truck was now at right angles to thé road, facing downhill
into the forest, with trees in front of and behind it.
