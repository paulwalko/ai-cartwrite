".., many of our vertical cavers are living proof that
only one method learned .well can be used exclusivelyi,"
This seems to be one solution to the problem of what has the
greatest merit in the arena of countless techniques,. There
seems to be another alternative to the problem, however, What
prevents the teaching of two techniques, one for ladder and
one for rope, so that the cavers may go outside their own
boundaries and enjoy themselves more fully?
For some years, now the VPI: Grotto has been evolving Ã 
systematic training program of training novices in underground
skills. The emphasis has been placed upon producing
"graduates" who are ca pable of handling themselves in any cave
rather than restricting themselves to only horizontal caves,
or allowing a: false sense of pride to restrict them to
visiting only pit caves. The caves in the area of VPI have
a delightful variety of passage types, and caves run from
small, strictly horizontal ones to pits in excess of two
hindred feet. To visit a variety of caves is the aim of all
cavers, and there is pressure here, more than in some other
areas of the country, to adapt training to meet this variety.
. The first stage of training is to institute a "standard"
set of techniques, if there is such a thing where cavers are
involved; The ladders are standard in themselves; belaying
procedures are those set forth in the MIT Handbook,
Fundamentals of Rock Climbing, (MIT Outing Club, Cambridge, ,
Mass., 1968).. By ease of access, Goldline has become a
generally used line within the Grotto, and thus special care
of manilla is eliminated. The care of rope is a continuing
subject of instruction. Test procedures have been set - by the
Grotto..constitution at five-man pulls on both rope and ladders.
A standard selection of knots has been made part of the mater-
ial on a qui:z that is a requirement for membership.
Ascending gear is somewhat less standard, as there are
at least five types of knots being used in the Grotto, and
several mechanical ascending devices. The basic four-turn
prussik is taught, in a three-knot prussik ascending rig.
The cavers who are then interested in other ways to get up a
rope observe other members and their gear, and then receive
independent instruction in other forms. The important thing
here is that in this case there is no formal class held,
where it is: said that" "This is the only proper and correct
way to do this". There are "formal" : training sessions held
several times a year at a local sinkhole, but there are
informal lectures by people who are training novices, along
the lines of "This bowline is used to rig in because... i the
prussik rig that I use is this...".. The instruction is
mainly demonstration. The idea is extended to actual caving
situations when the novice is shown the rigging process, and
given a commentary as the rigging and exploration procedes,
Since the rigging is allotted to various people at different
