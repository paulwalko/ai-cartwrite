THOUGHTS ON MAN AGAINST NATURE :
A FROGGY MOUNTAIN BREAKDOWN
Twelve. thousand years ago primitive man forsook caves
as a permanent residence. He found something more comfortable,
To, early Homo sapiens a mountain was not a challenge to be
conquered; it was a challenge to be avoided. By 1970 Homo
sapiens have not evolved enough physically from cave men to
.: be called anything but Homo sapiens. Two thousand generations
i's not really very many. But mentally man has progressed, He
seeks challenges; he descends the deepest caves; he ascends
the highest mountains,
Recently the author travelled incognito with five
members of a Homo sapiens tribe from the karst foothills
region. For convience I identify the members with these
anthroponomenations: Old Disinal-a male which migrated from
the Dismal Swamp; Moccasins Nice-a healthy female; Cripple
Leg-a warped male; War Krout-anale resembling Procon lotor;
and Mouth of Wind-a loud; non-industrious male.
The group travelled south to visit a former member of
their tribe named TWO-Dog Lover:who lived in the Great
Ducktown desert by digging rocksi Already with Two-Dog Lover
was Beer Nut, a male originally from the Northern Karst region,
The seven gathered together in the hut of TWO-Dog Lover
to decide what challenge they should conquer. ::"Let's sit and
drink about it," grunted Beer Nut. "No" chorused the other
naked apes. TWO-Dog Lover spoke, "Let us conquer the Big Frog
Mountain," It was agreed upon.
. The seven rode their mountain elephent Henry many miles
into the howling wilderness below the Big Frog- greatest
mountain in Appalachia; : Up, up they rode Henry, struggling to
climb the sides, the back, and then up the slippery neck of
the Big Frog... Every power of the Frog Mountain resisted;
every muddy gland and stoney rib fought the human polluters,
"The challenge â€œmust be met; the nature of Frog Mountain must
be subdued." cried Two-Dog Lover "Or the million years of our
evolution will be for nought" screamed Cripple Leg.
: On and on the seven fought the mountain from Henry's
back. Rain, the Frog Mountain's ally, poured relentless aid,
"Man against nature-the eternal struggle," gasped Old Dismal
as Henry spun upwards,:. "Nature shall never conquer our human
spirit and stamina,"... screeched Moccasins Nice, But nature
disagreed.
The Big Frog Mountain had captured a fly.. Henry slid
from the trail and smashed downslope to its forested grave,
Big Frog Mountain laughed; the Homo sapiens croaked,
