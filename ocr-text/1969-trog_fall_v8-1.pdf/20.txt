is a "V" ring of about 2,500 pounds test. At the other end

ring. The nonadjustable "V" ring was placed inside a six
inch overlap of webbing, and the webbing stitched together
with about twenty four inches of continuous stitching,
using nylon thread. This length of stitching gives almost
full strength of the webbing, and reduces the chances of
breakage at the stitching to almost nothing. It is important
that nylon thread be used. The job can be done by hand, or
by a shoe shop. but the use of a thread of lesser strength
will drastically reduce the safety factor in the harness

adding the adjustable "V" ring, and stitching a short section
at the end of the webbing into a stop block to prevent the
end of the web from slipping free. The straps were added, and
the job was complete.
