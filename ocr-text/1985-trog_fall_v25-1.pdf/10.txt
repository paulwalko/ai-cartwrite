RIDGEWALKING
"Ridgewalking" is one of those caver words like "fuktup"
that does not appear in the dictionary. Obviously, since lexico-
graphers do not spelunk, we are in a fortunate position to do what
we want and call it what we like. I personally think "hillcombing"
or "holehunting" would be more apt terms for the activity.
"Ridgewalking", this word we seem to be stuck with, is defined
anomalously as "looking for cave entrances", even though ridgetops
are generally bad places to look for caves and you can do it with-
out leaving your vehicle.
There are three kinds of ridgewalkers. The first carefully
searches through topo maps, notes the existing caves and limestone
contacts and develops a plan to systematically search the most
promising areas to find a predicted cave. The second drives around
and asks locals and landowners where the caves are and finds and
explores them. The third drives around and checks out holes you
can see from the road.
â€¢ Ridgewalkers one and two are generally successful, while most
cavers fall in category three, not that category three has no
merits (e.g. Trout).
Whichever type you may fancy yourself, there are a few rules
to ridgewalking.
1. Talk to people; ask permission to cross land.
2. Don't walk in full caving gear (Murphy's law applies).
Carry a big stick - useful for clearing spiderwebs,
moving small rocks, and probing possible animal dens
(Maybe for convincing reluctant landowners but not
recommended).
Winter ridgewalking is generally more successful -
fewer spiders, less obscuring foliage, and steam plumes
at upper entrances.
Be thorough - there are lots of big caves with small
entrances.
So, go for it! One good way to get out of the rut of going
to the same old caves is to find new ones! Don't think of it as
hiking; there, all you have to look forward to is the end of the
trail. In ridgewalking, however, you see the world off the trail,
and every groundhog hole is a new adventure!
