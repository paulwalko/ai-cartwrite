The ThislÄ— Tube!
Recently, a new record has been achieved at Clover
Hollow Cave. . Not only was there one gullible individual
who was eager enough to survey the beautiful 5" long gypsum
flowers in the terminus of the "thisle tube". But in factia
there were three! The first caving neophyte, a member of
the Va Tech Scuba Club, slid down the tube and upon reaching
the terminus, remarked on the origin of birth of those Cave
Club members who coerced said Scuba Club member down said
"tube". It was explained that other neophyte members could
be coerced down only if he remained cool. So... upon exiting
the "thisle tube" another member of the caving crew, a Va Tech
Cave Club "trainee scum", jumped down the tube. There was
a prolonged ominous silence issuing from the tube. Finally
the "trainee scum" ( note the quote marks!) began elicudating
on the beauty and rarity of the gypsum flowers at the bottom
of the tube. Said Cave Club scum removed himself from the
tube, where upon the third neophyte jumped into the thisle
tube. After another long ominous pause, the third neophyte
remarked that he had been had by a bunch of heinous swein.
the third victim also removed himself from the tube (with a
little help from above). Well...new "trainee scum" should
beware of this article and be advised... watch out for
seamingly irresistable views of 5" gypsum crystals down at
the bottom of body-sized, vertical tubes.
