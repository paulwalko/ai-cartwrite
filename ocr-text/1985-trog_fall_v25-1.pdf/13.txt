WHY CAVE?
Recently, life forms of the lower phyla (trainees) have been
asking members "Oh wise and holy one, caving is indeed entertaining,
but pray tell, why do people cave?"
"But, my little one, you have just anwsered your own question:
Caying is its own excuse," replies the grizzled and sneering member.
"No, sir, what makes people push nasty stream crawls and sub-
ject themselves to waterfall climbs and survey trips that have no
hope of ever producing a map. What makes people abuse themselves
like this over and over and over?"
"You will have progressed far on the path of wisdom, oh young
one when you learn not to ask such questions and drink beer in-
stead. Those who are less wize ponder this endlessly and have ac-
complished naught save to arrive at these three theories:"
1."To go where man has gone before" theory- Many people eternally
quest for virgin passage, speleo and otherwize. The fantasy of
breaking into a monster underground trunk passage and connecting
anything within 500 miles of Kentucky with the Mammoth System
lurks within the heart of many cavers. Others seek gold, under-
ground nudist colonies, or albino pot plants. But most, I believe,
are attempting to still the instinctive human drive to explore and
check out new and different places.
2.The Zen theory- The society we live in can be quite hectic and
damaging to one's karma. Many people need to get away from it all,
whether it be a crochity boss, the Immigration Authorities, or
Punky Brewster. The absolute darkness and quiet atmosphere of a cave
serves to still a troubled mind. The entire trip serves as a re-
lease for tension and allows one to get in touch with oneself and,
like, just be.
3. The Freudian theory-It is said that a man spends the first 10
minutes of his life trying to leave the womb and rest of his life
trying to get back in. Some had nasty childhoods, and caving is
a subconcious attempt to return to the womb and start over. Ponder
long the term "Mother Earth."
"Whether you (chuckle, snort) actually choose to believe what I
have taught is up to you, small one, but whatever your reasons are,
enjoy, and keep caving."
