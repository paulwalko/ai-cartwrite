IT'S DARK
It!s dark. It must be night. BUT NO- I'm in a cave!
And what's more there are bugs crawling on me and bats are
weaving complex geometric patterns with my imagination- around
my head! The mud is getting progressively more disgusting, gritty
water permeates my clothes, my hair, and my skin; obscene comments
vibrate down the thick walls, my muscles ache from the unaccustomed
stress, I'm permanently damaged from all the abuse I've absorbed ;
and worst of all my M-n-M's are spilling! DAMN IT ALL! This is
how it was in the beginning.
The bugs and bats are no longer relevant, the comments go
unheeded, I've learned to store my M-n-M's safely, and the wetness
is to be avoided. What's left? The pain, the challenge, and
the mental conquest are probably accurately descriptivei And the
dark, of course. For me it's a way to be alone and do my own
thing; but still be with other people. It's also an excellent way
to express one's aggressions in an acceptably violent fashion. .
And in the end, when we've changed; are get old, or for some
reason no longer cave, what will we remember?
