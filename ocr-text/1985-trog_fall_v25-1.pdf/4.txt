The Hill's System of Climbing Rope
Recently, I was faced with going on a vertical cave trip
without a vertical rig except knots (I got those signed off a
long time ago and didn't want to use them again). What was I
going to do? Well I'll tell you - build a rig with three Gibbs,
some sling and a couple of diagrams. I had to come up with some-
thing quick!. Thus the Hill's Climbing System came into being.
The reasons: I was afraid of my stitching ability for a rope
walker system, plus a rope walker takes too much time and costs
some bucks!
The system consists of a foot cam tied to the foot (if you
have a little more time and find that you actually like the Hill's
System, you may eventually find that sewing on a foot cam is
better). Another cam is attached to the seat by means of sling
and a carabiner. The cam is held up against the chest by shock
cord attached to the back of the seat. The third cam is hooked
to a long piece of sling so it reaches over your head. This
sling is attached to the other foot. The system works like a
rope walker except that the trailing foot cam is pushed up the
rope with each step you take. The chest cam rides along at about
shoulder height (depending on how long you make the sling).
One thing you must know about this system - it's not for
everybody and in fact you may hate it like I do on long climbs.
The system requires a lot of upper arm strength since you are
continually pushing the trailing cam up and pulling yourself up
the rope behind it. Fact is that this system requires many magic
words to get it going, if you know what I mean.
. There are many improvements that can be make on the system.
First, a Jumar should be used instead of a Gibbs on the trailing
foot cam. Second, a chest harness hooked to the rope is recommended-
this reduces arm fatigue from holding yourself on each step.
If you ask around the Club, you will hear a horrible lie -
that I hate my climbing system - such gross rumors! The fact is
I love it, it's great and most importantly it's mine and I designed
it - eat your hearts out all of you who have compared my rig to
cow dung; you know who you are! To name a few:
Craig Roberts - "It sucks, but it shows good design potential.."
Mark Honosky - "What a death rig!"
Craig Ferguson - "That's not a trailing foot cam, it's on the top
not the bottom!"
Trainees - "Wow, you made that, you're my idol!"
