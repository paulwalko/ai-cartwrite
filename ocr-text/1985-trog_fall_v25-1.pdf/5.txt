CHANGE OVERS
Emergencies, such as hitting a tangle of rope (figure 1) or
doing a long drop on a short rope, require being able to do
change overs. Change overs are also useful in non-emergency
situations, like speleolympic competitions. Change overs are the
transitions from climbing to rappeling or rappeling to climbing
or changing from one rope to another rope. Only the first two
are discussed here.
Rappeling to Climbing
Always look down at the rope so you are not suprised when
you hit the end of the rope. Non-variable friction devices such
as doubles or figure eights require 5 to 10 feet of rope in order
to lock off. Locking off a rack is simple as shown in figure 2.
Locking off brake bars or a figure eight require's wrapping the
tail end of the rope around your upper thigh until there is
enough friction to hold your weight. Hold the dangling end
between your feet as a precaution against unwrapping (figure 3).
When you have locked off, attach a knot or ascending device
to your seat and fix it to the rope above the rappel device.
Whenever rappeling, an ascender or knot should always be handy
and attached to your seat (not at home or in the bottom of your
pack). Now slide the knot or ascending device as high as
possible. When you are satisfied that the knot will hold you,
unlock your rappel device or unwind the tail from around your
leg. Rappel down the few inches necessary for your weight to be
supported from the knot or ascender. The rest of your ascending
rig can now be fixed onto the rope (and yourself don't forget)..
When you are satisfied that your ascending rig is properly
fixed, detach the decending device. Now climb!
Climbing to Rappeling
Slide foot knots down so that all weight is on the top seat
knot. Fix rappel device to your seat and to the rope below the
seat knot and above the foot knots. Remove the foot knots.
. The top knot must now be unloaded. This is done by either
tying a girth hitch (figure 4) around one foot or wrapping the
rope around one foot several times and holding on to the tail end
(figure 5). Your leg should be bent when fixing the girth hitch
or wrapping the rope around your foot. This enables you to
unload the top ascender when you stand up. When the knot or
ascender is unloaded, slide it down to the rappel device. Now
lock off as mentioned previously. Remove the seat ascender, !
unlock the rappel device and rappel with control.
These techniques work for me. There are probably other
methods. They will probably be hard to understand from just
reading this article but that's OK. They should be practiced
outside before being forced to learn underground. Talk to me.
