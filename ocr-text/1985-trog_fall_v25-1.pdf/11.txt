A RECENT CAVE TRIP
Recently, over Christmas break last year, I went home to
Kentucky and called around to see who in my high school cave club
was going caving. A trip was on for Jaguar Cave in Tennessee.
It sounded like a neat cave - jaguar bones thousands of years
old and aborigine footprints had been found in the cave. I
decided I couldn't pass this on e up, and called my friend
Sharon to see if she wanted to come along. Bad news! One
formertcaver with great petential had become traitor to all
Â· the caver values, had committed the worst possible crime (aside
from caving in orange coveralls), had shocked all ithose who knew":
her in high school. Yes, as hard as it is for me to relate, I must
say that she couldn't go caving because she had to look for a
dress for her sorority induction (no typo). (Honest-I couldn't
make up something that bad.)
The other members of my graduating class who wers not
corrupted by college life arranged to leave for the cave. Devasted
by the loss of our former friend, we barely managed to drag
ourselves out of bed and leave Lexington by eight that morning.
( I said we had not been corrupted by college life.) The drive to
Tennessee was not too long and we arrived at the cave and were under-
ground by noon. The entrance was impressive- a huge overhang with
a large flowing stream. We bopped down the huge passage and made
good progress through the cave. Finding the passage with the
Indian footprints took some time, but we had help from some "expert"
cavers from a Virginia grotto who all wore bright orange coveralls .
After a short conflict about the ethics of looking at a roped off
section of mud, wewatched them proceed on their way, and set off in
the direction of the prints.
The clarity of the footprints varied greatly. Of the nine
Indians who had entered, only one wore moccasins. Since the prints
are about two miles into the cave, it was assumed that another entrance
had been closed off in the thousands of years since the Indians had
visited. We gazed at the prints for a while then decided to cruise
out of the cave. Our "friendly fellow cavers" were standing around
in the large trunk passage, looking for the way out. We bopped down
