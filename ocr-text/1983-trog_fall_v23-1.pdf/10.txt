First Smedley, then Soami and Lawrence, freshly returned from
the harrowing Soami Air Rappel excursion. The attraction was a
new pit, paralleling the entrance pit about 20' away. In turn
all descended into what amounts to 'near virgin' teratory, 80':
verticle, 500' horazontal. Later we encountered NSS 37. Yes
a real old. timer, written on the wall (Philip Gaylord NSS 37)
a real historic name. We erased it in the name of cave
conservation and our reputation (just kidding). But 500' of only
near virgin passage has extremely limited capacity to capture
the attention of such expirienced cavers. What was really inter
interesting was the '100' (unseeable top). dóme at the end of the
passage. Nobody was brave enough to freeclimb the necessary
5.9 crack to the top so we left the way we came. While coiling
the rope at the top of the drop, Soami and Smedley became Monty
Pythonesque to a maximal degree. "Ni ni ni...." etc. "What the
fuck is going on back there?", Psycho bellowed. Meanwhile,
Lawrence was fingernailhold climbing along a nasty climb (This
is really really hairy!!) out of the pit. Us sane ones decided
to rope out. Soami and Smedley rappeled out of the hole. Psycho
Tarzaned out, "Wheeeee - haaaOUCH".
Finally on teraf'irmaménteme we remembered that the nearest :
beer was at the Newport. 7-11 or whatever the hell it's called.
Old Mill! Shit!!!! No St. Pauli? The End.
P.S. This is the hit single part of our article. TRAINEES!! .
WARNING!!! Take this seriously. Remember Soami's air rappel?
He fell 15! onto his ribs, made nice bruses. Don't trust chert
hand holds -- they're portable! You may fall on your head.
