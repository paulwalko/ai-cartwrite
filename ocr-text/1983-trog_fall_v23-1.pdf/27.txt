needed a change of direction to make our rappel hassle-free.
Psycho found a horizontal crack on the opposite wall and plugged
in a #3 and a #4 Friend (mechanical chocks for climbing). He
then tied a butterfly in the PMI and equalized the tension between
the three rig points. A beautiful rig job for sure. We have .
total. confidence in Friends after taking a few 20' screamers onto
them while rock climbing this summer. "
:-It was late morning now, and my body craved for my queen
size bed. Knowing that I was going to rape the the pit first, I
started to feel wimpy all of a sudden. Seeing my deteriorating
mental attitude, Psycho proceeded to say some very nasty and
distasteful things about moi and my sex life, which he envied. .
Ithis editor was threatened about leaving that envied part in)
Thus we initiated a 15 minute ass-kicking wilburing session that :
had us jumping up and down and getting wild as hell; cracking ::
jokes about every bozo caver we knew. 'I was now ready!
Keeping one eye on a car size boulder defying gravity and
the other for the bottom, I rappelled down a fantastic 701: ::
borehole. I took one change of direction over some razor sharp
Ã«dges and went down another 90' to the bottom. An awesome, a :
truly awesome pit for sure. After tucking myself away from the
rockfall zone Psycho orgasme'd his way down this fine pit.
Taking note of a survey marker, we cammed: up the pit thanking..
PMI for its superb abrasion resistance as we went past those
razor edges. We did notice one small side lead on the other side
of the pit, probably conecting to Paraplegic Pit. Ohh nooo, a
return trip.....
Beating all the odds, we were in a "rush".' So we wilbured
out of the cave forgeting the agony of carrying all the gear
.for a short while. We popped out around noon to a giorious...
warm day, blue skies, and BEERST :
As I sit here writing this article, Bane's Spring still
beckons us. We have to do some unfinished surveying, push the
back to the limit, connect several pits by bolting a traverse',
and check out the dome complex in the older section I just
recently heard about. What makes my nads shrink is the thought
of dragging my 2 precious Nikon's (both with 28mm Nikor lenses)
