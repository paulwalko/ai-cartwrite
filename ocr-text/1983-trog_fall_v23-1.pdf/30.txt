we were talking about. With a little prodding, though, he admitted to there
being such an entrance behind his house but that it was "nothing we would
want to get into". (Ie. he "preferred" that we did not go in) So off we
went again, furthur down the valley, to a place called Cave Hollow. The
landowner, Mr. Kender, was in his 50's and full of cheer (the bottled kind).
He told us to go right ahead but I thought we had better take a look before
getting suited up. Approaching the bluff Jack and I looked in amazement
as we felt a blast of cold air come streaming from the entrance. Well that
decided it and in no time we found ourselves chimneying in a narrow phre-
atic passage which ended after about 200 feet. Making our way out of the
cave Roger noted a slot in the floor about 40 feet from the entrance. We
just happened to have a 70 foot piece of rope with us and there just hap-
pened to be a perfect jughandle directly above the widest part of the crack.
I was the only one with vertical gear and so had the honors of going down.
The fissure soon opened up into a medium-sized canyon with a drop of about
45 feet. Derigging, I proceeded down the passage. It got smaller at first
but then opened up into a large canyon about 15-20 feet wide and 40-50 feet
high.. Agood sized stream came down the passage toward me and made a jog to
my right into what looked like a large siphon. Upstream the canyon con-
tinued with no hint of ending soon. Having seen that it went I returned
to the bottom of the drop.
-Jack.
-Yeah.
-It goes. Big time!!
Exiting the cave we found four other locals waiting for us with Mr.
Kender (word apparently spreads fast in those parts). Kender's mother (80+ ?)
kept telling us of an entrance across the road that she used to visit
when she was a girl. So Jack, Roger, the four other locals and myself
spread out over the hillside but searched to no avail. We all then headed
down to the clinch River to check out a couple of rat holes, one of which
went back a couple hundred feet whereupon several of our group proceeded
to get their attitudes adjusted.
Exchanging addresses, we thanked the whole bunch of them and hopped back
on 460 headed east. On the way back I asked Jack if there any caves reported
in the areas we had been that day. "Nothing at all" was the reply. "Reckon
there's no caves out there then......"
