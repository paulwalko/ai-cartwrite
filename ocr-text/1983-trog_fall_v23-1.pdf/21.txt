20 of this year we finished the survey. The cave has a beautiful
Yogi Bear type entrance in the side of a sinkhole behind the
barn. This leads down four steps in large walking passage to
a spacious "entrance room" that has evidence of rats. It would
make an interesting archeological site because the flat clay
floor and ease of entrance would make an excellent shelter.
The room is well lit at certain times of day. The crawlway
down to the left has a sidelead marked "Claybourne's crawl to
Butler pit". The "pit" is a widening dropoff about 10 feet deep
at the end of an extremely tight tourtuous crawl and was not
surveyed. Up the ladder, the passage goes up and down,
alternately walking and crawling until one gets to the "junction
room" where the dig began. The dirt from the dig was dumped :.
here. The "Big Room" is in the form of a transverse canyon, : :
one side of which is composed entirely of flowstone. It is
about three feet wide and six to ten feet high. There is airflow
in the upper lead, but Garrie determined the lead to dangerous
due to loose sharp rocks wedged in the ceiling of the tight:
crawlway.
The cave was a "for the record only" in Douglas under the
name of Thompson's Cave, John Hancock, son of Sam Hancock, said
that people used to keep their taters in it, and he knew it as
Tater Cave.

A CHILD'S GARDEN OF CAVE PHOBIAS
What could be more
frightening to some
cavers than to meet
spiders, rats, snakes,
or a large animal in
a cave? Us real
cavers know this
to be a silly
Â· childish phobia.
