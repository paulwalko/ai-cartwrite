TWO CAVERS ON EL CAP
Last summer several caver-climbers went out to Yosemite to enjoy the
laid back Camp 4 lifestyle, Bob Carts, Blaise Berry, and Mike Artz of the
J.M.U, Cave Club were all there. And Drew Bedford, wildman, new wave
rock climbing maniac was there too.
After the others left the valley, Mike Artz and I were the only ones
left. We had been hoping to climb the Nose of El Capitan and now was our
chance. We srent a day nocking our nearly wasted haul sack with 4 gallons
of water, 2 ropes, a killer rack, food, sleeping bags, and a quart of wine.
We thumbed down to the base of the Nose. "Uh oh",. we said. There were two
Americans just now rapelling down after fixing a few pitches. And looking
up we could see the 5 Austrions who were also on the route. After bumning
out a while, Mike and I went and looked at the Salath√© route. No one
vas on it. We started fixing pitches,
::.While climbing the first pitch, Mike noticed that we needed the big
hexes. Searching through our houl bag, named The Bitch, I found no hexes,
We had so8.ced out and left them with our other gear - stashed in a small
cave four miles away. Chingada! In the remaining twilight we started
hiking back to our cave. Hitchhiking at night, we get no rides. After
an hour ve arrived at the Vi.?lage Store and bought an Olympian dinner -
a six nack of Budweiser and a half pound of Dorritos.
It was getting late by the time we got to our cave. Instead of
returning to El Cap, we spent a miserable night without sleeding hags
in Mike's dome tent.
