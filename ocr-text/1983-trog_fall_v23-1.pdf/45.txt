The next pitch was an A3 aid climb. The second piece I put in was
a hair too small. When I loaded the chock it sucked through the crack
and I went selling down 15 feet before the rope caught me. I landed right
in Mike's lap. It was very strange to fall without expecting it. I saw
the granite wall turn into a blur, then I was face to face with Mike. I
went back up. Fortunately there were no more falls on this climb.
The following pitch was a mind blowing roof. It had 3000 feet of space
below. . Turning back nou was out of the question.'
As evening approached we found ourselves on the 95 degree (overhanging)
headwall. We were weary but we had to keep climbing to get to a ledge.'
After two pitches it was pitch dark. I put on the heedlamp that we had
brought along. I was a mindless climbing machine. Put in the piece. Test
it. step up on it, clip the rope to it, then repeat - as quickly as possible.
Another chock popped out and sent me sailing into the darkness. It was
just like climbing in a cave. I'm glad it was dark because of the 3000'
of overhanging exposure. But the darkness became a problem when my *#&**%
headlamp burned completely out. We took a break. Should we give up and
sit in slings all night? No! I went back to work, not knowing if "Long'
Ledge" was 10 feet up or 100 feet up.
I placed a piton. Its hearty metalic ring told me that it was solid.
Stepping ur, I found that two fixed pitons followed. Progress. Above I
could see a tiny ledge. Mike and I could take turns sitting on it all night
I thought. I did some easy free climbing in the dark to find that the ledge
extended on. It was big! It was our bivouac! I yelled the good news down
