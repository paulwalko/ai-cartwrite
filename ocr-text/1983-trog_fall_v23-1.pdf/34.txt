"Looks like it opens up.".
. "Is she squeeling?"
"'Yes, come on." The beers had shut up.
US two Wilburs follow in, we crawl for a little ways and
. come into the bottom of a 60' or 70' dome. 'John is standing .
there, "Ey00000000000... Awsome... Eyo000000000." Frank gaz√©s: .
around, "Fuckin' A man, we gotta name this Wilbur dome." I look
at John and say, "Eyoooooooo.. good job, we might even promote :
you to a Wilbur." We spent a couple of hours exploring around.
Another dome of equal height was found after a couple hard climbs.
We named this Pinicle Dome and made some bad jokes about some of
the wimpyer members of the club. We were able to climb up to
the top of the breakdown and mud fill between the two domes to
discover a phreatic passage going across the top of the domes.
This was THE LEAD, Bolt climb next time. It's Miller time!
We named the begining of the passage we found Secret Gate due
to its. appearance, and cruised on out.

"Eh man, how about if I come by your place tonight for a slide

"Sure. How'd they come out?"
"Oh God... Awsome. They all came out even better than I
expected.. Chip Clark is gonna see these and go hide his camera.
Eric is going to go with us this time. We'll bolt up that dome
and see what happens." .
"Win got me the map of cave rat from Koerschner. (Thanks Bill)
I'll show it to you tonight. Oh nooo00.... we're going to have
: too much gear next weekend."
"Ha Ha Ha Vilburs don't need sherpas. You don't get nothing
done if you gotta worry about a bunch of sherpas. See you
later. Don't work too hard."
Frank also brought me an awsome 8 x 12 print of the formation
