TKNALITE
A CAVER'S BEST FRIEND ?
Lug
Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of all commonly
used spare light sourses is that they never work when you need
them. Disenchantment with flickering, browned-out disposable :-
flashlights has led many cavers to purchase the mercedes" of
the mini-flashlight world - the TKNALITE. In the catalog it
has everything going for it -- compact, lightweight, reuseable,
durable, but in the cave its fickle performance is capable of :.:
turning even the most mild-mannered caver into a ravening
beast. What begins with a light rapping against one's palm
usually ends with a brutal hammering against the nearest rock
accompanied by much cursing and nashing of teeth. To make
things worse, the little bastards are built so tough we are
even denied the satisfaction of destroying one. What causes
these savage attacks? Perhaps it's the fifteen dollar price
tag, or the sense of helplessness and frustration as the dark
closes in, or maybe it's just the stream of cold, muddy water
that's slowly filling your crotch as you lay there fiddling
with a stupid flashlight. Whatever the cause, the aggravation
can be spared by a simple modification of the TKNALITE'S
weakest.point; the rather tenuous contact between the base of
the battery and the coil spring that runs the length of their
light closing the circuit to the bulb. Performance can be
improved by inserting a short machine screw, ball-bering, or
other short metal object securely into the tight coils at the
end of the spring. I used an aluminum cable crimp 7/32" in
diam. and 5/32". long. Watever the object, it must fit tightly
into the spring and its length must not exceed 5/32" or the
flashlight will not close. This modification was fieldtested
on one 21 hour Roppel trip and performed flawlessly. Perhaps
this was not a sufficient test period to show the longterm
effect of corrosion on the new contact, but one thing is for
sure - it worked better than before!
