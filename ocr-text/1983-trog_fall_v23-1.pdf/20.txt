The Sam Hancork's
System
Sam Hancock's Cave is in Ellett Valley just north of
Blacksburg.. Located on the property of Rev. Sam Hancock, it
consists of large and small phreatic tubes in Middle Ordovician
limestone and has few formations. Ask anybody in the area
about caves, and they probably will refer to "that cave up".
behind Rev. Hancock's house."
.. One day in early '82 Garrie and I were out in Ellett
Valley and checked in at Rev. Hancock's. He said that sure
we could go in his cave, and we could take the ladder off the
side of the house. We said we probably wouldn't need it , but
after looking at the sheer 13' climb, we went back out and got
the aluminum ladder. We saw most of the cave in less than an
hour.
On August 20,''82 Ed Divine was down looking for people
to help map in Paul's. At the
time, there were very few people
around who had surveyed at all, it
being summer and all. The following
day Ed, Carolzo, and five trainees:
Mike Futrell, DeeAnn Peterson,
Garrie Rouse, Bill Kelly, and I
went to learn to map in Ellett
Valley. First we mapped Johnson's
Cave, then Sam Hancock's.
I ended up with the Sam's
notes, and Garrie got the Johnson's
notes. Most of Sam's was surveyed
but... there was a promising dig left.
Needless to say we dug on it over
three trips, finally reaching the
"Big Room" at the back , which was
namned befor we saw it.. on January
