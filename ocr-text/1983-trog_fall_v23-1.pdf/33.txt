all the girls see this one.", as I snap off the shots.. :
:.: "Well I can't think of much else to do. Looks like we! re
gonna hafta go caving." So we bebop on in the cave and down to
the cable ladder where we decide that it's not wet enough to
warrent wetsuits. As we're pulling them off Wilbur gets off a..
discustingly gross joke which he has obviously been saving up...
Then he sits down and says, "Oh, I don't rig no more on sport ..
trips." "And I'm tired of doing all his rigging. Here John."
says I, and I take a saet on the other side of the drop. John
does a threehanded doublefisted whatknot, backs. it off here and
there, and looks up. It looks bomb proof to us, so we go on :
down taking pictures and sleeze through the filter. On the way
to the formation room I match Wilbur.'s gross joke.. We take
numerous awsome shots during the next several hours. Then we
head. further into the cave and expiriment with some 'caver
siloeted in a canyon' photos. All the while we're getting off .
on the bizzar light shows. ."Awsome... Awsome... Wow" is the
extent of our vocabulary. "Here Wilbur, you do the flash and
let me watch. Wow, I can still see it. It's like glowing:
Awsome like your on drugs or something."
We leave the photo gear at the begining of cave rat passage
and start crawling in the small stream. The beers were begining
to whisper, "Drink me...drink me..." We cruise on out to the end
and proceed to get lost. So here we are, lost in a straight
passage. Wilbur says, "This hasta be the end the Koerschner
lead must be around here somewhere." So each of us picks a hole
and starts ratting around trying to follow the wind. I'm up a
breakdown choke pulling out rocks where my breath is being
sucked up a hole. Frank is pushing another breakdown pile.
John leaves his pack behind (remember this, it's the key to.
finding virgin passage) and squeezes through a rock and a hard
place. "Eh john, what's it look like?"
"I think it pinches out."
"Well push it."
Acouple minutes later Frank calls, Wilbur, think we should
follow John?".
"I don't know, hold on:" "Hey John, what's it doing?"
