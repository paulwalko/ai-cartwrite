him what kind of weather is to be expected.
How to coordinate and delegate: ..
If other people are now with you to help, responsibilities
can be split up (this can also be done by phone). The VPI
phone roster should be used to contact everyone (there are :
125. names, most with two phone numbers). CRCN, the Cave...
Rescue Communications Network, should be notified and put on
standby to be mobilized if necessary. As each person is con-
tacted they should be quickly told what gear to bring, what to
wear, and where to meet (at the sign-out sheet). Ask if they
can supply a vehicle, if they know of a cave in that area, :
and if there is another caver with them. Get them to calli :
someone else. Ask someone. to drive to the hospital to question: .
the injured caver if possible.
What to do when you meet at the sign-out sheet: .
: Use. 4WD'S if available because of the snow. Get chains
on cars and get everyone gassed up. Presently at the sign-out
sheet location is all the rescue gear and club .carbide.....
Everyone should fill up with carbide and water. Rescue
gear should be loaded in a single vehicle if possible so it
doesn't get separated. Each should driver should copy his
own directions from a master sheet including the farmers
phone number (in case you get lost). Consolidate cars, and is
instruct everyone to stay within speed limits. You won't be .
of any help if you are in a ditch, a hospital, or a jail. .
. If they are available. (and we have many in our :files).
take topo maps to the farmers house. He may be able to point,
out cave entrances or landmarks. They are also helpful to :
establish a search grid.
What to do once you reach the farmers house:
Park like you know how. Don't block the road for
emergency or search vehicles. Send a 4WD to try to find the
cavers car. Use low band radios if available. When the car
is found, the sheriff can run the tags to find out who the.. :
cayers are and where they came from. The grotto nearest them
