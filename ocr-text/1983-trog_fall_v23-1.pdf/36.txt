it can be freed the last 10 feet. Looks hairy though. Hey let's
get Eric, yea he'll climb anything." So Eric goes up, flashes
the climb and calls down, "Hey. Frank, it's really easy I'll
rig the rope so you can cam up." "Fuck you.", was the response.
Frank .cammed up and he and Eric went off to explore the passage.
"One hour max, you hear, sign in time is getting close:" :I
was starting to get worried about time, especially since I had
to be at work in a few hours. John and I bagged out after
killing the rest of the food. I promptly fell asleep and
proceeded to set my shirt on fire. I woke up coughing with my.
bag full of black smoke,' Finally they came back, rapped down
off a not so bomber rig, and we proceeded to exit. Leaving
everything behind except for the bare essentials we were able to
reach the entrance in record time. After 17 hours we were all :

and I went to work.

Frank drove his Subaru up to the entrance as Lawrence tried
to follow in his 'Black Lemon', he had to stop down the field
a little ways. We went through the ritual of goofing off
and jamming to tunes. "Wow, we got some of the best cavers in :
the club here." They were anxious to get going so in we go.
Stymie and Wild Bill wern't accustomed to peculiar subjects of
the jokes which we try to gross each other out with. There
was the usual fart contest going in, and the leader was winning.
"Wilbur (cough) let me (gasp) lead (choke, gasp)" Wild Bill.
was hanging back to avoid suffocation in cave rat, however, we
all made it there. Just before secret Gate we split up:
Stymie, Lawrence, and Bill would start surveying while the rest
of us would go ahead and do the climb.
. I was going to etrie up the bolt climb so Eric pushed some
leads and bagged out. I rigged in and Frank set up to belay.
I went through the process of clipping in bolts, beaners, and
etries; clipping and stepping. "Wow...this is awsome." I went
up about 25' to where a crack'started. The next bolt was 10' up
