As soon as there was a hint of light we were up and going. Luck was
with us that morning. We borrowed a camera from an Englishman named Graham.
Our luck continued as some. climbers gave us a ride to El Cap.
We jumared the fixed ropes. I tried to houl the haul bag but it was
a big bitch.
That day was almost entirely free climbing. Mike and I led
several 5.10s. I ran into some trouble on some 5.10 face climbing. I
climbed strait ur for a while then put in a nut and pendulumed. As usual
hauling was more strenuous then climbing. Our last pitch of the day was
climbing around the "Half Dollar", a giant granite coin chimney. There
was a nice bivouac on the Half Dollar. The view was very nice. Mike and
I started to think twice about the climb. It was a long way up and a long
way down. Could two cavers really pull it off?
In the morning we continued going up. Two easy pitches led to Mamotha
Terraces. Then we did the commiting 150' rapell that was pert of the
route, I led ud o wierd zig zagging crack with a pendulum. The rope drag:
just about killed me. Then hauling the Bitch really got my goet. But :..
.
that was nothing compared with Mike's next lead.
It was the cursed off-
width hollow flake. After penduluming into the crack, Mike had only one
piece of protection for about 100 feet. A fall would have given Mike a lot
of air time. Right as he finished the climb, it started to rain. I jumared
the pendulum and cleaned the crack. It was very easy to clean - there were
no pieces. We spent the next night here on top of the Hollow Flake. ..
The next day, August 31st was my 21st birthday. We climbed up 8.
pitches to El Cap Spire, the best bivouac ledge of the climb. It was very
airy up there.
To celebrate my 21st time around the sun we drank the quart
