and back on the right. I would have to reach this bolt by using
Friends in a muddy flaring crack. I reached up and got a place-
ment with a #3. I clipped in my right etrie and eased my weight
on it. It looked good so I put my full weight on it and proceeded
to bounce. The Friend hadn't moved. Bomber. I reached down
to my left ankle at the bolt and pulled the rope through and
clipped it into the Friend. I then transfered over and WHOOOOSH..
THWANG. Frank woke with a jerk; "Wow Wilbur that was AWSOME."
I was about to die laughing. I was suspended right in front of
Frank 25" below my previous position. "It was like Disney World.
Wow that was fun." I laughed. After regaining my composure I
went back up using one etrie as my left one was still up the
climb. This time I put in three Friends. They would all have
to pop to throw me down again, Nearly burned out I reached the
upper bolt and did the freaky climb using the rappel rope from
the previous trip as a hand line. I rigged a fixed rope. for
the survey crew, rapped down, and broke into the food. The

dome.
The lead at the top of Pinicle Dome had to be done now.

dones a Friendly killer rack, ties on the bolt kit. A silence
goes through the room. He pretends to chalk up, "Yea" softly
utters from his lips. His eyes flash red as he smoothly
ascends with a caress of stone. At about 20' me' and Frank are
starting to get worried, "Eh eh eh better put in a peice:"
"Yea... maybe in the next ten feet I can find a placement."
and he climbs on. . Frank and I are getting off big time. This
guy is totally insane. I'm glad Frank is belaying and not me...
The Wizard plugs a #1% Friend to calm our faers and goes to the ..
top. We are awstruck. He sets a bolt and does a 6'wide chimney
in the top of the dome, directly overhead of us. The word
exposure is not in his vocabulary.
What does a real caver do when he doesn't have toilet paper?
he uses a rock.
Eric rigs the rope and 'I follow with a gibbs safty, cheating
