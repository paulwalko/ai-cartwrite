Wilburs Mopping Up
Bane's Spring
Due to a temporary but "pretty! distraction, I have not
caved or climbed seriously for the last 9 months. Psycho
and I did a few good bozo trips over the summer but that was
that. But things change and life has its bitter moments.
So once again I started to cave this fall quarter and remembered
how great it is to be underground away from life's harsh
realities. Winter quarter is around the corner and I promised .
myself and friends to push at least 120 hours underground,
Hopefully this will prepare me for some hard climbing this
spring.
When I last reported to y'all in the spring '83 Trog the
Wilburs were doing an aid climb up Whistling Wells to check
visible high leads - and we were half-way up the magnificent.
195' pit. One Sunday afternoon, March 6, Eric "The Wizard"
Anderson and I decided to rappel Whistling Wells beyond the
first cable ladder drop. It had been done once, but not
"fully" rappelled to the bottom. Eric zipped down and landed
on top of our aid climb. Damn! So we started the slow
process of cleaning the climb. It was a pain. The aid
climb did confirm that there were no leads. to be pushed. We
learned many valuable lessons and had fun doing this climb.
But while camming out of the pit, I noticed a horrendously
tight lead, only 10' below the lip of the rappel. This squeeze
had a large amount of air flow and the distant roar of a
waterfall lured me through the 12' of man-eating popcorny.
passage. Oddly enough, it. was virgin and I was stopped by
a virgin pit. The lack of ropepads prevented us from the rape.
With this in mind, we headed out. The next 5 hours nearly
killed Eric and I. We dragged over 100 pounds of climbing
gear, including 2 ropes through miserable crawls and streams
that Bane's Spring is memorable for. It was such a harsh
experience that Eric did not go caving with me until October.
