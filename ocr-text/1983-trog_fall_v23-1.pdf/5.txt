The Psychic Squall
Oh I wish someone would write this one for me. Let's see
I could bitch, thank, or just bullshit... Hmmmm sounds good..
... Well at long last here it is. I'm sorry it's.late, but.
then this isn't something you would want to show your parents .
over Christmas anyway. I recieved practically nothing, extended
the deadline, harrassed a bunch of people, and finally got
material. Fortunatly it's mo'stly good stuff. So to those of
you who wrote, Thank you very much. If only I could have gotten
some help typing, organizing, and producing this publication.
Oh Well, I got to do it all myself - my way. So if you don't ..
like - to bad. My goal is to show other grottos and VPI alumni
that some real caving goes on here and not just a bunch of
Þożo-speliobopping. This Trog: may not be very good goofy
entertainment for the party, but for instance; it will show some
trainees that there is a lot more to caving than bebopping..,
through Pighole or Newberry's. There is so much work, so mäny
caves, so little time; a few of us can't do it all. Read through
There and find out where some of the action is." "Look at. Rouse,
running down a thousand feet. of virgin trunk - and nobody even
wants to go oaving with him! And where has everybody been at
the ! partys' this quarter?? You been home in bed making your
own party? Huh? Surely you can!t have anything better 'to do
on a Friday night. Come on host a party, Lawrence and Becky do
get tired of having it at their places. I know transportation
or lack of mind altering substances isn't the problem. Let's :.
see some' enthusiasm toward the club. Lawrence hasn't been able
to get a mapping crew into Starnes all quarter. Beleive me, he
will show you some rewarding challenging caving. It's winter :
quarter now - when the club does most of it's caving. Just
think...... it's 3° out, howling wind, 8 inches of newfallen
snow, you've been under for 14 hrs, you're muddy and soaked wet
to the bone, you come out and the car is a half mile away,..ie
but you're smart, you thought ahead, a tree, you reach up,.....
you're fingers fumble, Psssssst, Brew, Ahhh.... The things...
stories are made of. See y'all underground.
