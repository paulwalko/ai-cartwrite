to Mike. I was reaching the edge of endurance now - the two climbing ropes
tangled my legs and the gargantuous rack of chocks and pitons tangled up
my arms. It was th 13th pitch; 14 would have cracked me. I placed 5 big
pieces by feel for Mike's anchor, then with my last strength I hauled up the
Bitch. After clipping in, we snuggled into our sleeping bags and collapsed.
It was a fast, deep sleep. We woke up to beautiful sunshine.
The highlight of the trip was when Mike and I threw some shit bags down.
My bag took a long time to get down. It fluttered down, growing smaller and
smeller until it was only a speck. We saw it land on Hollow Flake ledge
where we had slept two nights earlier.
We climbed the remaining four mellow pitches to the top. We wanted off.
From the top it was a grueling hike down to the valley floor. It was finally
over! We rested a few days after all that. I should say I rested a few
days. Mike only rested one day before resuming his amazing 5.11 free climbing.
I was bulsy smoking dope and playing guitar under the pine trees.
Would I do it again? I think so. Next summer we'll have a haul bag
that won't wear. out, more Friends, and porta-ledges!
