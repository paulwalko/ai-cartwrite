drop in the cave after Win and some of the Skyduskites did
the waterfall pit in April. The high risk of rockfall, lack
of natural anchors, and generally manky limestone (for bolts)
foiled all previous attempts, until now: It's Wilbur Time.
Many caveclubbers called it a death pit......
After listening for two hours to Mrs. Bane's boasting
about her son Joey's casanova appeal and then hearing Joey
confirming his stud abilities, they graciously allowed us
to enter their cave at 10. PM! Very nice people indeed.
:: It was a cold and windy night, and my spine shivered as
I remembered those outrageous: midwinter 24-hr cave trips;
coming out in subzero temperatures, wind howling, and
totally exhausted. : The Whr walk down the mountain froze our

heat tablets; and more chocolate candies. Yes, we relax
and cave in style these days. Looking back, it still amazes
-me how much Psycho eates, and it's all chocolate!.
After our munch. We kicked down several tons of rock to
make the first descent more pleasant. I noticed an obscure
ceiling jug and after some cleaning and padding we rigged
the PMI. We looked for a backup anchor and we also:
