The difference
38
It has come to my attention that many people who don't cave and are not familiar with
cavers and their ways don't understand caving jargon. For instance, when one mentions
that he is a caver they say, "Oh you mean a spelunker." To which you reply, "No, a caver"
and then try to explain the difference. This article is written to give some guidelines
on explaining the difference between Cavers, Nerd Cavers, and Spelunkers. I suggest that
each of you make copies of this to pass out to all of your noncaving friends in order to
educate them on this important subject.
