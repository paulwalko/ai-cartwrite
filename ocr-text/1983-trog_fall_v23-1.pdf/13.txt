The caver struggles up the steps to the porch. His coveralls
are frozen solid, as he weakly pounds on the door in frantic.
senselessness. The porch light comes on..
In the light, we can see that the cavers right hand is
white and blood streaked. His helmet is crushed on the right
side. His nose is running and his eyes are wide in a fright-
ening stare. The farmer slowly opens the door with a shotgun
in his hand. Yes they have a phone. Injuries in a cave?
Rescue? Come in, come in! As the caver stumbles into the
warm room, the farmer's wife enters and pauses in amazement.
She hurries to put wood on the recently roaring fire. The
caver's pack and helmet are removed. A. large discolored
swelling is revealed on the caver's head. His coveralls are
stripped off, as he strains to recall a number to call for
rescue. The farmer dials the long distance number as the caver
is stripped: to the waist and a blood soaked handkerchief tied
around his right forearm is revealed. The caver moves towards
the fire. As" the farmer gets an answer, his wife removes
the handkerchief and the caver collapses, unconscious.
YOU' are at the opposite end of the line! If Montrose
Cave were in your area, how would you develop a rescue effort
with such minimal information? What would you ask the farmer? .
Equipment? :: Communications?. Weather? Personnel? If you .. .
seriously consider this situation with your group, you will, ....
after much thought, have to construct a' rescue tree. If done
properly, the plan could save a real life. Don't assume anything!
