JOHNSON'S CAVE
.
On November 11, 1981 Jim Washington and I, still a couple of lowly.
"trainees", descended into Ellet Valley in search of the elusive Cat Trap..
Douglas states in his book that the cave was "recorded in VPI files as a
pit over 100. ft. deep (1950)...". All that we could find was some guy
plowing his fields to plant grapes (of all things). Undaunted we proceeded
to the next farm to explore Johnson's, a cave which we had relocated earlier
in the day (see Jim Washington's article, Fall Trog 1981). Fort-five :::
minutes later we exited the cave having found little of interest except
for a 23 year old time capsule left by some cadets of Va. Tech. .
During the friday get tgether on August 21, 1982 a number of us trainees
approached Ed Devine and Carol Zokaites telling them that we wanted to learn
how to map. No, we did not want to play lead dummy on a miserably long :
mapping trip in a cave for which the sketch would be 5 years in the coming.
We just wanted to learn how to map.' So the following day Ed Devine, Carol
Zokaites, Jim Washington, Bill Kelly, Mike Futrell, Deanne Peterson and
myself showed up at the sign-out sheet ready to take on the uncharted realms
of the underworld. The only problem was thathie hadn't quite decided on where
to go. Jim and I knew of a couple of rat holes and so off we went, back
down into Ellet Valley, for a fruitful day of exploration, including scaling
pole climbs in Sam Hancock's and leap-frog mapping crews along the Johnson's
trunk.
Well Jim took Sam's and I took Johnson's and we both swore we'd have
them drawn up in no time. But the days turned to months, and then a year
went by with no sign of their completion. Rekindled by mapping efforts
in Slaughterpen, Lynn Hollow and Muncie's Caves, Johnson's was finally drawn up
and inked. Forty-nine man hours underground and a year and a half later
it is here for you to behold - two parallel lines stretching from one corner
of the page to the other. Oh well. (Rumor has that a sketch of Sam's will
make its debut somewhere in this issue but I wouldn't hold your breath.)
