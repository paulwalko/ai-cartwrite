ALL'S WELL THAT'S TAZWELL
"Tazwell?? why no one's been there in over ten years" I heard an
old timer say as others of his vintage raised their eyebrows and cocked
their ears towards the podium. Yes, Jack and I had done the unspeakable.
We had driven more than one hour to go caving and, what's more, had gone
to Tazwell - that county where all landowners shoot on sight. But we
were spurred by a little area on a 1912 30' quad called Sinking Waters.
I pointed it out to Jack amid the many unfolded topo maps. He quickly
scanned Douglas and Holsinger - "Nothing" was his reply. So on October
11th, 1983 we headed out 460 armed with maps, files, books, ropes, wet-

Within half an hour we had passed the Rich Creek turnoff and found our-

And so we were introduced to Roger, a local who would have us bounced
all over McGuire Valley, Sinking Waters, Pounding Mill, the Sinks and then
some before the year was out. The person Roger had been talking with was
Kenny and he had actually been down in some of these "holes". He told us
of one up the valley which had a very tight crack for an entrance but then
opened up and came to a drop off whereupon you could hear a "river" flowing
down below. Roger knew where he was talking about and so Jack, Roger and
I headed off. Unfortunately, the landowner said that he did not know what
