BUDGET KNEEPADS
If you need knee pads but don't want to spend any money,
you should try my all new trainee-scum partially disposable
kneepads. Items needed to make these kneepads are 2 pairs
of old tube socks, 4 sheets of newspaper, and 2 40". pieces
of string. The first thing to do is to take 2 sheets of
the newspaper and keep folding it in halſ until you get a
rectangle about 3"x57". Now take this rectangle and put it
in the center of a tube sock with the long side verticle,
Take another sock and cut the toe off. Slide this tube over .
the newspaper bulge in the first sock.so that it rests loose.
Grasp both ends of the inner sock and pull tight. Tie these
ends behind your knee. Next take one of the pieces of string
and tie it tight around the påd. Make sure the knot is tied
behind your knee or you will have a hard time untieing it.
because of the inevitable mud. These kneepads will work, even
if they get soaking wet because the sock. will hold the paper
together. The only major problem with this pad is that they
will fall down (like all pads) if you don't pull them up
from time to time. If you go on a trip and get the pads
soaking wet or muddy, all you have to do is throw away the
newspaper and wash the socks. The outer sock will last several
trips (depending on your style of caving). before any major
holes appear. When this happens just turn the sock around.
so that the holes face your knee.
