Newcastle Murders Us Trip
i
.
It was a dark stormy night. On the small, narrow embankment
outside Newcastle MURDER HOLE (Sinister organ music) four
innocent? unsuspecting cavers. hudled closely together. "And :
this photo is Sally from St. Louis....", Lawrence was saying.
. Sometime in September Sir Lawrence, Psycho, Smedley, and
Soami travelled to the wilds of Craig County to challenge the..
murder hole. Why ? Noone knows. Possibly because it was
there. Actually this is all Bullshit. It was a nice day and
Lawrence thought there might be an undone pit. Don Davidson
had told him of a pit that was not done nor put on the map.
After our adventurous, arduous journey ("What's the last
thing to go through a bug's, mind when he hits your winshield?",:..
asked Lawrence. "His asshole." A dose of responsible landowner
relations and we got there. Clothes changing, rope pulling,
tale-telling, advice to trainee scum Smedley and Soami.....
Before we continue we should probably talk about this
enigmatic beast, the traineescum. Some say that the definition:
of a trainee is a person who is not experienced, not a member,
and not very confident. we prefer to think of a trainee as a
person who learns quickly, and bouyed by this state of over-
confidence is too stupid to realize the real dangers involved.
. Thus we find ourselves at the bottom of the 90' entrance
rappel. Ahem, the passage we seek is halfway up one wall of
the pit. Psycho gibbs halfway up the entrance rope, and plays
Tarzan as Jane Smedley bounces him back and fourth between the
walls of the pit, as he tries desperately to fuck the passage
leading to our goal. "Ouch!", screams Psycho repeatedly, "What
the fuck is going on down there?". After several attempts at.
swinging into the hole, Mike decides to simply climb back to the
surface and climb/slip down to the hole in the pit wall.
:: Meanwhile, Lawrence and Soami venture into the main cave.
They travel many walking passages, climb many fun verticles,
traverse many gaping pits, and Soami practices his air rappel.
By now Psycho. found his way to the hole halfway up the
entrance and tied off a rope for the rest of us to ascend.
