I saw Eric's parents at a local theater and they told me, "You ..
nearly killed our baby!" It was that trip that Eric coined his.
infamous phrase: "Oh noo0000...."

Two memorable excursions that I took since then were into
Bane!'s. Spring withMike Futrell - Psycho. One trip, March 1?,
was to check this newly found pit. With minimụm gear - highly
unWilbur 'like - we flashed to the cable ladder drop psyching
each other with good Wilburing and contriving atrociously..
lewd jokes about each other. We heavily padded our 200' PMI :
through "Maneater Lip" and proceeded to pad 2 ledges 5' and
101 below the main lip. I was given the honer to rape this
pito: It was a clean beautiful 80' drop. With 2 change of
directions (total of 4) and a few batman hops. I rapped
down another pitch, about a 50-footer. I looked down a.;
difficult 101.climb and saw a survey mark, P22, the stream
survey... AWSOME MAN, I just rappelled though "Topless Dome".
This was a dome that noone knew how to rappel into or if 'it:
had a ceiling that was accessible from above. Topless Dome
was 'only approachable if a bozo rappels to the stream via
Whistling Wells or any pit beyond the first cable ladder drop.
Psycho bebopped down and we were exited with our find. He
ascended first with his newly improvised half gibbs - half
prussik bozo rig.' Psycho had a lot of problems climbing on
this bizzar creation and swore he'd sew a proper gibbs rig:
I died laughing as he struggled up the drop. His rig was
such a handicap that we christened our borehole "Paraplėgic :::
Pit"...We Wilbured through the crawls and exited the caye.
7 hours, after entering it.

On a late Wednesday night, October 26, I was really
uptight with school, work, and life in general, I needed
a release. when Psycho got off work I buzzed him to see if
he wanted to go to Bane's Spring tonight. He Wilburingly
agreed. Psycho and I had been plotting to rape the clatter
pit for some time. "Two weeks earlier a strong party of 7
attempted it but failed. "The Clatter Pit was the last virgin
