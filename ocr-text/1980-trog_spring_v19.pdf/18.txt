pushed on to the other side of the formations picking a very careful path.
Another low, flat-ceilinged room and a short climb down brought us into passage
we'd seen before. We were on top of the breakdown pile at the end of the 50'.
crawlway which leads away from the pit. My light went out, but we were so near
the entrance that I decided to exit with the flashlight-in-teeth technique,
One quick glance back at Bill and Keith showed that they were almost out of
light too, so we made a quick exit to avoid any REAL trouble.
Two months later Bili, Keith and I returned with Dave Bell to survey the
big passage leading to Horseshoe Falls that Sandy, Bill and I had found back in
November. Part of the trip was to be a rescue attempt on Ortiz' pack, but one
look at the water level ruled that out. Besides, we knew how nice it was to
stay in the big stuff anyway. We tied in to our last survey and headed down-
strean. Big passage is nice to survey, but it almost gets boring. We mapped
about 1000' before leaving.
The next week we took two teams into Spring Hollow. Sandy, Pam and Mike
Wolf took a photo trip while Bill Koerschner, Bill Gunther and I mapped. We
were determined to get to the passage on the far side of the 43' pit, and Bill's
notes indicated that Horseshoe Falls wasn't far from the pit. We went to the
falls and pushed the leads in the breakdown ceiling. We popped into a lon,
low-ceilinged room with flat slabs for its floor. After surveying across to
its end we found ourselves looking at the 43' pit again, this time from the
side we wanted to be on. Bill Gunther started the scramble back so we could
connect this side of the pit with the entrance side.
Meanwhile, I started poking around some of the breakdown at the edge of
the pit, looking for a suitable place to throw the tape over to Bill when he
got there. I realized my stupidity too late; I found myself slowly sliding
down a mud-covered breakdown block which sloped menacingly towards the pit. I
had never before prayed while caving but this was it! Several long moments
later I felt something solid after dropping about six inches. I was on a con-
vieniently placed ledge, about 20' from the point where Bill could reach on
the other side. A few minutes later he reached the pit and I tossed the end of
the tape over, closing a large survey loop.
Next we started exploring a small side stream which drained into the main
stream just above Horseshoe Falls. It opened into a large dry trunk which was
about 30 or 40' above and parallel to the main stream. It looked to be an old
upper level of the stream, but leads took off everywhere, I pushed down one
passage and popped out of a small hole about 30' off the floor. I oticed a
large room and told Koerschner we'd have to bring in a cable ladder the next
trip to get to it. According to survey notes we were headed directly for
Banes Spring cave and our excitement over a possible connection was running
high.
Ortiz, Bill and I returned a few weeks later to check out the new upper
section that we'd found. We decided to do some side leads before heading for
the passage I'd pushed on the last trip. One of them looked pretty promising,
and we pushed into it for a grand total of 30' before it pinched down to a
clothing ripper. The walls were studded with popcorn that felt like barbs on
a hook. This was definitely a one-way passage.
Tired of rotten leads, we surveyed over to my find of the last trip. We
were soon disappointed to learn that it led in the same general direction as
the main trunk we had just been in. Apparently, the large "room" I had wanted
to cable ladder into was the same trunk, and I had simply popped out of a hole
