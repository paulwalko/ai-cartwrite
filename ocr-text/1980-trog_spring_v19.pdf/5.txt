even stronger. We're going to lose a lot of members at the
end of this year and we're going to need a lot of new members
in the coming year to assure future continuity.
To our present new members, it's your club now, too.
There is always plenty that needs doing. Get involved on a
committee or two, or if you see something that needs to be
done, see what you can do to see that it is. Write an article
for the "Trog" (That's for you, Pat), practice techniques for
"Old Tiners", learn what you can from those who are leaving,
help out at a Vertical Session, but just get involved!
I thank all my friends in the Club, old and new, for a
very memorable year.
