FALL PROJECT 1979
by WIN WRIGHT
Last fall the club launched a ridge walking project at East
River mountain in West Virginia to familiarize newer members
with the geologic occurance of caves and to get some mapping
projects started. Along with several caves already known in
the area, a few new holes were found. Joe Zokaites and Hugh
Beard started mapping one of them that had a 90' entrance pit,
but unfortunately that's all it had to show. Bill Stephens
started mapping the largest cave in the area, known as Cave
Rat Cave, and is presently drawing up the map.
Bill Shipman and I started mapping two of the other known
caves in the area which the West Virginia Survey book referred
to one of them as Honacker Cave. So I mapped the larger of the
two and drew it up only to find out that you spell it 'Honaker'.
I am changing the spelling on the #2 before we submit the entire
project to the West Virginia Speleological Survey.
Not drunk is he, who from the floor
can rise alone and still drink more;
But drunk is he who prostrate lies,
with out the power to drink or rise.
