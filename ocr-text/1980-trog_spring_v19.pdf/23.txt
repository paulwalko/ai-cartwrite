The low lead in the flowstone room started in a little cubicle large
enough for two people. The passage was 15 feet long and hourglass shaped.
The middle was 3 or 4 inches wide and the bottom was filled with debris.
The top must have been smaller than a coat hanger because I couldn't even
get my shoulders into it. I called Ed and we switched places. He was able
to get in just past his waist and no more. There wasn't anything for him
to kick against in the room. He wedged himself in, slipped down in the
hourglass and tried to back out. A mintue or two later he announced he
was stuck and couldn't breath too well but would try some more before
needing help. Two mintues later I went in and started yanking on his feet.
What finally got him out was pulling on his jacket which had bunched up.
He was just as glad to get out of there as I was earlier,
That finished another lead so we started another one that was supposed
to end in a few feet. Ha, ha. Going Around the corner I found myself at
the top of a 15 to 20 foot canyon. We chimneyed around a comer into walk-
ing passage which opened up to ten feet high by four feet wide. About
fifty down, a crack on the right wall revealed a similiar sized parallel
passage. Stepping into it, I was amazed to find the mummified remains of
a mouse. , How it got there, I don't know, I took the right passage and we
got our first fifty foot shot! This is in Pauls' remember. If we had had
a one-hundred foot tape we could have used it all! It kept getting larger
and we passed through several rooms. The second room had a ten foot by
four foot passage disappearing into blackness that we didn't even touch.
We kept in the main passage which became a four foot wide by ten inch high
crawl. It opened up into another room, and another, and another,... By
this time we were hysterical. Spontaneous giggling would often erupt.
We came into a fifty foot break down room with leads everywhere. Halfway
down one of these leads I found a bone. Rather, half of a bone. Even so,
it was six inces long and had a two inche socket. Since the room was dry,
and water hadn't flowed in it for perhaps thousands of years, it was prob-
ably the bone of a bear.
We journeyed onward with Ed constantly yollinis at us for goins so fast
and giving him thirty and forty foot readings instead of the three to seven
footers he was used to in Pauls'.
What at first appeared to be the end of the line was a very lar;
two layer room. We came out on top and walked around. The floor opened
up into three pits. I finally found a way doim to the bottom, looked up
and almost died. The place we had been walking on thirty feet above was
actually several large break down blocks touching opposite walls that had
fallen inward and were holding each other up hy sheer pressure. There
was no support underneath. Lucky for us we don't wiegh much.
Amazingly, there was only one lead out of this large. It was in the
floor and dropped down to a small trickle stream. After some slightly wet
crawling it ended in twenty to thirty foot pit with sheer walls, This is
where we stopped. There may :or may not be leads going out the bottom of the
nit. That is for a future trip to explore.
We decided to go out the recently discovered Harmon's connection.
It invovled several tight crawlways, one rather lone, but it saved us two
hours and havine to go throught Wollow Hollow again, (dam!). The entrance
to Harmon's was a steep mud slope- very diffucult to get up when your tired.
We were in the cav' a total of fifteen hours and were the first ones to
do the connection entrance to entrance.
So ended my first Paul Penleys trip and it was a doozy. We discovered
and mapped the biggest passage yet; and it's heading for Newberrys. We
totalled 1600 feet of virgin cave and set 91 stations. I really can't wait
to get back in there. It was a damn good trip.
