high up on the passage wall.
This was when the real action began. Bill dropped his notebook down a
20' pit that we had just explored and found to be a dead end. I climbed back
down to get it and was on my way back out when suddenly I found myself on the
floor of the pit with no light, a groggy head and blood everywhere. Bill and
Keith yelled, almost simultaneously, "Chuck, are you all right?" I returned
with a shaky "I think so but I can't stop spinning and I'm all bloody." I
managed to get my lamp lit and Ortiz began lowering the cable ladder into the
pit,
I realized that I had trusted my full weight to a thin limestone fin and
it had snapped, causing my fall. My cuts were bad; my right hand and knee had
deep gashes and I could see that my knee would require stitches. I ripped off
the bottom half of my undershirt and wrapped it tighly around my knee to curb
the bleeding. My hand wound had clotted, so I left it alone.
With a tight belay from Keith I ascended the ladder and we started the
slow process of trying to get me out of the cave. We realized that it was up
to us to get me out because the rest of the club was holding a practice rescue
in New River cave that day. I couldn't bend my knee at all, 80 I had to struga
gle through the crawlways dragging my leg behind me. It took about four hours
to negotiate what had taken us about an hour to do on the way in, I don't
think I've ever been happier to get out of any cave than I was that night.
Six stitches and six weeks later Bill, Dennis, Tom Saxton and I returned
to map some more. It was early April and the spring weather was too nice to
miss. We spent all morning ridgewalking the area, and we actually found a few
small caves. When we tired of this we dragged more logs over to cover the
Spring Hollow entrance a little better. After finally having run out of good
excuses to avoid caving we slopped through the entrance and were on our way.
We took Tom on a short side trip to the formation room, and also checked
for any leads we might have missed in that area. After that we moved on to the
dry trunk and its maze section. After spending about an hour pushing leads
that went nowhere we picked up the survey and continued down the trunk. Tom
and Dennis had no patience for mapping in the maze so we left the cave. Dennis
and I kicked ourselves for not having brought our camping gear as we'd original-
ly planned. It was another beautifully clear, starlit night on Big Walker
Mountain,
Bill, Greg Babcock and I returned in May for what Bill and I thought would
be one of the final mop-up trips. We wanted to push the far upstream end of
the cave, and we knew that Ortiz had seen at least 150' of passage before losing
his pack there. We ju ped right into the stream crawl, and fortunately the
water was low. Bill and I were able to squeeze through a low spot, but Greg
simply couldn't make it.
We mapped for about an hour in loose, sloppy breakdown but saw no sign of
Ortiz' pack. It was extremely grungy and dangerous, so we called it quits and
went back to where Greg was waiting. We finished off another small lead and
then left. All in all it was an unproductive, disappointing trip. I was fed
up with Spring Hollow and decided that I wouldn't go on any more of Bill's
mop-ups. Too bad !
Dennis and I should have pushed this crawl, for beyond it lies the majority of
Spring Hollow cave. I only saw it two years later as a tourist.
The largest of these caves is 240', surveyed by Bill Koerschner last year.
