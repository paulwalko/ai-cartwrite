THE FRENCH-CROSSED CARABINER RAPPEL RIG
Often when vertical caving, the caver is faced with a short pit or a
ladder pitch where he is required to dig out his rack or doubles (this can
be a real pain) and rappel down. I have found a safe, useful alternative is
to use the French-crossed carabiners, an established European speleotech-
nique. All that is required in addition to the seat carabiner is a pair
of locking carabiners, an item usually clipped to the outside of the vertical
pack. For this usage steel carabiners are preferred, but provided the rope
is not too muddy or gritty aluminum ones will suffice.
The technique is simple (see diagrams). Pass a loop of rope through one
carabiner. Clip the second krab into the loop, then clip the same krab into
the part of the standing line that leads from the carabiners to the anchor.
Pull on the line and snug the krabs together. MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE CARABIN-
ERS ARE LOCKED!!! The resulting device tends to give a fast rappel compared
to variable friction devices and heavy persons (greater than 200 lbs.) should
excercise extreme caution in its use. I weigh 210 and have safely rappeled
the 120 foot entrance shaft too Pig Hole using French-crossed biners, but
I have never used it at any other time for a pit greater than thirty feet,
Be advised WEAR GLOVESI!! As with any other (in fact, all vertical cav-
ing technique, this method should be perfected on the surface.
