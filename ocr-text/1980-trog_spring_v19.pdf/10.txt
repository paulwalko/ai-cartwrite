CHASM OF DOOM
by Bill Stephens
A few years ago Bill Koerschner and myself mapped a going lead in Banes
Spring adding about 0.2 miles to the 1.8 mapped by the Whittemores et, al.
Now it appears that this length may soon be doubled even if things to bad.
On March 29, Philip Balister, Steve Lancaster, Debbii McKee, Frank Gibson,
John Heard, Brent Barnes and I entered Banes Spring for what looked like a
routine sport trip. Five others were in another croup which went a different
direction. We headed back to the terminal siphon room and stopped for a break,
At this point I began looking around the room feeling for air movement at small
cracks between the rock ceiling and the mud walls. Finally I pulled out my trusty
cave shovel and handed it to Frank who was eager to dig.
Meanwhile, Steve and Philipe began some digging in a dirt filled side lead.
Frank and Brent were digging away with the help of the others and soon a strong
breeze of pulsating air was blowing through the dig. With little success, Philipe
and Steve returned and Philipe and I took a few tums at the ever so tightening
dig. After about three hours, with everyone freezing, we almost gave up. I de-
cided to give it one last shot and eventually forced my way into a low, wide
crawlway. I called for Philipe to come through and took off.
After reaching a complex junction I went back and called for Steve to come
and in no time we were gone. Past the junction we hit a trunk. A few hundred
later the stream came roaring in from the side; we had bypassed the siphon,
After about a quarter mile we were beginning to hear the roar of a large water-
fall and I began to yell for a connection with a stream bearing dome in the Banes
end of Newberry-Banes. We finally got to the waterfall and went a little farm
ther. Climbing down towards the lip of a canyon we picked up a few rocks and
threw them in, Wow!; a four second pit. We were freaking out. Sure of a con-
nection with Banes, I took off my T-shirt and throw it down the pit. Temporar-
ily satisfied we left the pit, returned to the others, and left the cave.
During the week, I got out some maps and began to get rather pessimistic
about a connection, but a week of waiting would tell for sure.
The next Saturday Bob Alderson, Joey Fagan, Win Wright and myself returned
with 225 feet of Goldline and 100 feet of Bluewater. Once in, we found Bill
Koerschner, Ben Keller and Bill Olver already surveying. . We went to the pit,
rigged it and, unsure if the rope was long enough, I started down, "The pit
opened up to an incredible size so that I couldn't see the far wall. Soon I
could see the bottom and fortunately (unfortunately?) the rope reached. I was
not in Newberry-Banes.
Bob followed me down, and after some initial exploration, we called for
the other two. Through a meandering canyon we finally intersected a stream. A
few hundred feet upstream we reached the base of a waterfall while downstream
we found a windy stream dig. We tumed around and left making it an eleven
hour trip.
