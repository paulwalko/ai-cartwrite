Here it is a new decade and all thats left of the seventies are
memories. This holds true for the club in its new generation of
cavers. Everyone was impressed with Bill and Richards success
in building such a strong and intelligent group of bust-ass cavers.
Among this group are the secretary Carol, the treasurer Sue, the
parliamentarian Ed Fortney, and supplies chairman Philip Balister.
Bill Koershner has finished Spring Hollow and Ed Devine has
virtually finished Paul Penleys but you never know what you'll
find next in Paul's. Joe Zokaites has been working with Ed and
hasn't given up yet.
And what would Skydusky Hollow be without virgin passage to
explore? Bill Stephens successfully completed a dig in Banes
Spring that unleashed at least a couple of miles of cave that
features loose rock and several pits. Stephens also dug in
Newberry's and discovered the largest stream in a Skydusky cave.
It is hypothesized that this stream contains the water from
Spring Hollow and Banes Spring.
This hypothesis should soon be proven as Joey Fagan is work-
ing on a project to hydrologically connect the Skydusky cave
system to surface springs through dye tracing. .
The ridge walk last fall produced several projects out on
East River mountain in Mercer County, W.Va. We also had a
successful weekend at Buddy Penleys this May fixing the road to
Newberry's that was rutted at the 1979 picnic.
We may have a line on a possible field house but nothing is
certain yet. If we do obtain a place, it would be used by mem-
bers and their guests but great caution must be excercised so as
not to abuse the privelege so delicately obtained.
For the upcoming year, Vice-President Chuck Shorten and I
project new membership of twelve and plan on ridge walks, vert-
ical sessions, practice rescues, and of course bust- ass caving.
We'll see you at OTR!

Win Wright, President
