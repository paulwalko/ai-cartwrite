LOOKING
BACK .....
With less than 24 hours left in office, I'd like to make
one last statement as Vice President. When I was first elected,
a year ahead seemed like a long time. Now that it's over, it
seems as though it was all too short. It is certainly a year
I shall never forget.
I first began caving independently early in '78. It didn't
take me too long to realize that, although I enjoyed caving, I
did not have suitable preparation for it. I came to one of the
first Cave Club meetings Fall Quarter of '78 and have hardly
missed a meeting since. This same time was also the beginning
of the end of my 5 year marriage. I watched helplessly as that
situation grew worse, but at the same time I was becoming more
deeply involved with the Club.
Although I seldom talked about my problems, the friendships
I was developing within the Club gave me the support I needed
so badly. To all of my old friends, although you may not have
known you helped, you did, and I thank you,
As Winter Quarter passed I realized there was some question
as to who would be the next V.P. I was still a Trainee at the
time, but I felt strongly that I could do the job, and I really
wanted the opportunity to work with people that the job would
give me. To make a long story short, I became a member in
March and Vice President in April.
At that point I knew I had to do some serious caving if I
was going to be able to do the job I wanted to come Fall. I
caved every opportunity I got, read, and learned all I could
from our veteran members. I'd like to especially thank "Daddy"
Don, Pete, Chuck, and Bob for teaching me so much.
Although I'd never even talked to Bill before election
night, we hit it off well and became good friends and an ex-
cellent team. We felt a lot of enthusiasm for what we could
do with our new offices, and we could feel the Club respond-
ing to that enthusiasm. I want to thank every member, old and
new, for the support and the help to make it the good year
that it was.
To our replacements, whoever you may be, I wish you much
success in office. The Club is strong now, but it can be made
