PAUL "BAH" PENLEY'S
by Lawrence Britt
· This Paul "Bah" penleys mapping trip began on Oct. 13. Ed devine was
the sketch, Joe Zokaites was the brunton reader, and I was lead tape,
together we mapped a whole new section to Paul's that still has incredį ble
potential.
We started our Saturday trip by stopping at. Molly's house, We got
the inevitable cup of coffee and after an hour and much grumbling we de
cided to get caving. Just then Buddy pulled up and we spent another en
joyable hour talking to him. He could remember cavers going to map Paul's
long before Ed 'took over the joh. Ed himself has led 43 trips in. " That
and the fact that the cave still doesn't have four miles of passage sho'ild
tell you how tight and mazed it is. : .
Finally we arrived at the entrance. This was my first Pauls' trip.
and I was told that the way we were going in had been blasted open. I
could tell as Į squirmed in, and I immediatedly encountered the delightful
mud that Paul's is famous ford oh, it's great!!). After quite a while
of chasing Joe's heels through a maze which immediately confused me, we
got to the beginning of Wollow Hollow. My previous conception of this:
infamous crawl was totally devastated by its reality. Each of us put a
garbage bag on for protection against falling water, and our packs went..
into seperate bags. By the time we got through(2 or 3 mintues) all of ::
the plastic bags were shredded and the packs were wet. Since the Harmon's
Avalanche Pit connection, however, Wollow Hollow and two hours of Penleys
can be eliminated in order to get to the back, .
After a bit more travel time we started to map. We closed a minor
loop op, two and started pushing a passage which opened up into a small
flowstone room. Of the two available leads I chose the high, one first..
The upwards passage, angled at 30 degrees, nårrowed to a crawl and became
muddy. From then until we finished mapping we were in virgin passage. I
crawled along to a point where it became extremley tight, and I could see
ahead 20 feet to where it appeared to end in a small cubby hole. I
sincerely hoped that I could turn around there for I felt that once I got
past this point I couldn't back up. Both hands were in front of me and
my jacket would bunch up if I tried to go backwards. I squirmed aheal
until I got my head and my shoulders in the cubby hole. I knew then for
sure that I couldn't turn around in it. I couldn't ever get halfway in.
I lay there a few mintues to catch my breath while Joe and Ed shouted i
advice. I was breathing so hard from exertion and the room was so small
that I blew out my lamp three times. Fortunately I carry a butane lighter
(empty of course) around my neck for just such an emergency(I only need a
spark, not a flame). Using the lamp striker would have been impossible
in such cramped quarters. Finally I was able to get a hand down to my
waist to hold my jacket in place. If I had had to back out uphill, I
probably wouldn't have made it. Because it was downhill and muddy, though,
I was soon out and ready for the next lead.
