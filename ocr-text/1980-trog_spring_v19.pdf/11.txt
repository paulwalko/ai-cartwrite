In the weeks that followed, Bill Koerschner continued to map with several
thousand feet surveyed. He found an upper level bypass around the new 200 foot
pit via a 20 foot ladder drop. This leads to a very deeply entrenched canyon
with a number of smaller pits. This area of deep pits and canyons has been re-
ferred to as the Chasm of Doom. Koerschner has named the big pit Whistling
Well because of the shrill sound of rocks accelerating as they fall down the
drop. A proper rigging point could make Whistling Well deeper than Triple Wells
in nearby Newberrys.
Another half mile has been explored here of upper level trunk and crawls
and there may be more to come, Further, exploration and mapping could put us
still closer to other large caves in the immediate area. One note to people who
decide to go back there is to beware of loose rock. Rappels of the Whistling
Well can be quite dangerous due to rock fall and people at the bottom should
stay as far away as possible.
Hopefully, our further efforts in Banes Spring will be rewarding.
