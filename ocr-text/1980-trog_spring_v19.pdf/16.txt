SPRING HOLLOW
by Chuck Shorten
In June, 1975 I went backpacking on the ridge of Big Walker mountain
with Russ Seward. We were nearing the end of our hike and decided to take a
short-cut to our car which was parked in front of Buddy Penley's house. As
we were crossing the Bane's upper pasture we were enjoying the wild strawber-
ries when I spotted a small hole in the ground, It was about six inches in
diameter, and dry leaves which I placed over it definitely indicated a blowing
air flow. I grabbed the nearest rock and threw it down what sounded like a
15 to 20 foot pit. I was getting really excited, but Russ had to get back to
Blacksburg. Unfortunately, I too had to leave and the summer vacation started
in less than one week. My new cave would have to wait until fall.
The following November, Dennis Vaders, Pam Wolf and I set out for what
promised to be an interesting dig. We started late, spending hours to round
up shovels, picks etc. We reached the Bane's about noon, and they gave us .
permission to dig as long as we would cover the hole to keep cattle from falling
in.
When we reached the hole, Dennis jumped right in and started tearing at
the ground with his bare hands. Pam and I just sat back and enjoyed the show.
Dennis quickly tired of this, so we got out the shovel and started digging.
We moved a few boulders and quite a bit of soil before opening up a slot that
Dennis thought he could fit through. After donning his gear he started lowering
himself into the slot, only to become hopelessly wedged at the waist level.
Pam and I pulled him out and the digging resumed - this time with the heavy
artillery.
Picks and shovels were discarded and out came the chain hoist. We had
opened a crack about 12" wide by 2'long with bedrock at one end and a 300 lb.
boulder at the other, After digging around the boulder and managing to get a piece
of sling around it we rigged in the chain hoist. When we started to pull the
houlder shifted, fell out of its sling and crashed through the slot, falling a-
bout 10 feet. Spring Hollow was open!
The three of us quickly gathered our caving gear and positioned Dennis'
bluewater rope down the entrance, Dennis rappeled down the short drop and
announced that the pit appeared to be climbable, Spring Hollow had already
claimed its first victim though, for the bluewater was wom about half through
where it had been insufficiently padded on a sharp edge. Pam and I scrambled
down and joined Dennis for the first trip into Spring Hollow. What a feeling
being the very first person to ever see this cave!
We pushed through about 100' of fissure-like passage and reached a small
pit. A small stream flowed from another passage to the left and dropped into
the pit. This would ensure a wet climb on that drop, but we decided to push
an upper lead which trended in the same direction that we'd been through al-
ready. This lead went about 50' before coming into a low breakdown room with
leads everywhere. By this time our excitement was pretty high, but we were
really tired from all the digging we'd done. We left the cave with a good
story to tell.
The next day I retured with Ed Devine, Bill Koerschner and Keith Ortiz
