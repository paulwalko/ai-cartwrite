and the mapping began. We surveyed through the entrance and to the bottom of
the pit; 43 feet. Ed pushed around in the breakdown at the bottom, but he
said it was too dangerous to be down there by himself in the unstable mess. We
took the survey through the crawlway to the point we had reached the day before;
we weren't too optimistic that this cave would go any more than a few hundred
feet,
The following Saturday, November 8, Bill, Dennis, Sandy Newman, Tricia
Vacile and I returned to do more on the survey. Dennis and I rappeled into
the pit to push that lead while the others waited at the top. We spent about
half an hour pushing breakdown leads, but none of them seemed to go. There
was this one sloppy crawl, but Dennis looked at me and we both shook our heads.
We rejoined the rest of the group at the top of the pit. Tricia was getting
cold, 80 Dennis took her out while Bill, Sandy and I went exploring at the
end of the 50' crawlway.
The passage we found on the other side of the breakdown put a new meaning
into the word SCOOP! Huge walking passage 20' x 40' with a large stream told
us that this was no small-time cave. This passage went about 700' before drop-
ping over a 12' horseshoe shaped pit. Breakdown filled the pit's floor and
large boulders in the ceiling hinted of passage above. We now had several
leads to check out, so we left the cave.
By now, the Spring Hollow bug had bitten Bill about as hard as it had me,
80 we returned the next weekend to start the survey over properly. Ortiz had
used a Sunto compass without a clinometer, so that made the previous data vir-
tually worthless. Bill took on the cave as his project, so he was taking the
sketch. Ortiz was reading Brinton, I was lead tape, and Ed and Dennis were
off exploring the trunk passage we'd found the week before
We surveyed from the entrance to the top of the pit where we turned and
headed upstream. It was the typical meandering stream survey characterized by
slimy passage walls, three foot shots and loose ribble ceilings which shift
constantly. After about five or six hours of this we broke out into a low,
dry room with two leads. We took the upper one and mapped into another large
passage. We went to its upstream breakdown end and Ortiz disappeared through
a low stream crawl. Bill and I opted not to follow, and after about 30 minutes
We saw a faint light and a soaking wet, groady caver emerge from the crawlway.
Keith had dropped his pack down a small hole and had been unable to retrieve
it. Being his usual "safe caver" self, the only light he had left was on his
head, so he had turned around for fear of being stranded without light. Bill
complained about this saying "if you didn't push the whole passage then that
means I'm going to have to."
Unfortunately, we were now faced with a carbide dilemma. Without Ortiz's
pack we had only a little over four hours each worth of fuel, but mapping con-
ditions couldn't have been better. In front of us were massive amounts of
virgin trunk passage, so we made the obvious decision; who needs light anyway!
We turned our flames down low to conserve and pushed on.
After the horrible stream passage we'd just been in, the trunk passage was
like a dream. We surveyed about 4 or 5 hundred feet of it before coming to
cascades of flowstone and pure white calcite formations. Soda straws filled
the ceiling joints and flowed into bacon draperies along one wall. It was too
beautiful to believe, and it was totally unspoiled. All the grunting and slop-
ping through the stream passage was now far from our minds !
The carbide problem presented itself again when our flames became too short
to survey by, and we now had less than one carbide change among us. Still, we
