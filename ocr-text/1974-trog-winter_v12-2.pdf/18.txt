can be followed several hundred feet horizontally and 70-80 feet
vertically through a large breakdown room into a 40 foot wide
wall to wall rimstone walkway, undoubtedly the most extensive rim-
stone area I've ever seen. After mapping what we found at the end
to be a loop. created by breakdown, and therefore not a "true" pas-
sage, we pushed through breakdown into the stadium Room, a large
breakdown room. This room appears to be similar to the Big Room
(it's really big) in Sloan's Valley Cave, Kentucky in its mode of
formation. Two or three overlying passages collapsed, leaving a
room with mucho breakdown and several passages going off from it,
We chose a passage at ceiling level and proceeded to survey a canyon
passage developed in a ten foot thick bed. of dense chert and lime-
stone. The walls had a "bricked": appearance. The survey ended be-
cause the lead man didn't want to break any formations in a crawl-
way 8'x 13'. Retreating to a side loop, we mapped into a dry crawl-
way ten feet wide and two feet high. It was the first thing I'd
seen all day which reminded me of my beloved Crumps Cave in Ken-
tucky. Psyched by this crawlway, I crawled ahead at breakneck speed
to find the next station, snapping the new $12.00 Leitz fiberglass
tape with my sudden start,
We tied the loop in, then headed back to the rimstone area for
a food break, Paul Stevens, the trip leader, expressed a desire
to take a picture of someone in the four foot deep rimstone pool.
Always up to a challenge, I volunteeredSince we had a trip of
several hours plus two ladder climbs between us and the entrance,
I decided that in order to stay warm, I would strip to my tattered
shorts and helmet for the dip in the pool. I went through several
poses, then was joined by another member of the party, wearing
nothing. . We couldn't persuade Cady Soukup to join us in the tub.
Dressing for the return trip, we went and poked around a large
breakdown room, discovering an unclimbable twenty foot pit before
starting out.
My impression of Organ Cave (or the Greenbrier System) was one
of passage so modified by breakdown and flowstone that the original
nature of the passage is lost. I like to groove on ceiling channels,
but I saw few in Organ. Leads were everywhere, but in unpredict-
able locations. It is one of those caves where the the passage
size is huge, and the outside world a remote possibility, where
one can get lost, literally, in the underground wilderness.
