One of the easier parts of the trainee requirements was
getting endorsed by a member in good standing. With two days to
go before the meeting, I accomplished this task. I was engaged in
conversation with the president and two other officers that night,
I had just recieved a war-game in the mail that afternoon and the
president (being hard up for entertainment that night) wanted me to
go out to his apartment with him and "play the game".
It was the best offer I had had all day, but I decided aginst it.
Seeing the kind of mood he was in, I flourished my trainee sheet
before him and got his signiture,
On Thursday night, now a mere day away from my culmination of
hopes, I visited the residence of the vice-president to take the
comprehensive test and the carbide lamp test. These were adminis-
tered with much skill and foresight (and a damn sight more patience
than I would have for a clod like me). The comprehensive test
was, as stated before, general information concerning everything.
This was given in fill in the blank, short answer, essay, and dis-
cussion form. The carbide test involved putting a disassembled
lamp together, answering questions about trouble shooting, and
being able to reload the lamp in the dark.
My final requirement was passed off the afternoon before the
meeting. I went out to Maybrook Sink Hole with two other trainees
and a member. This member showed us how to belay properly and then
proceeded to show us what it is like to catch a falling body by
pushing a hundred pound dummy over the edge while we tried to belay
it with the rope around our backs. We then were allowed to belay
him on a cable ladder with the rope passing through two beners
behind us. The lesson was very good and I learned much from it.
The meeting, then, became the crescendo of the symphony that
was my neophyte stage. I was yoted in as a member.
This, then, was the experience I went through to become a mem-
ber of the club. I whole-heartedly approve of such a system. - I
feel that a system such as this one makes a person into a better
caver by forcing him to know and do things which he might not
otherwise, I think it is just good sense to have a base-line of
minimal caving expertise for members because it creates a standard
of abilities which is generally enough to make a person trustworthy
in his caving.
A quick scan at the things that were required shows that al-
though the requirements are not too much, they cover a wide field
of abilities. Knowing your lamp, general knowledge, and climbing
skills are basic for all cavers, Rappelling, prussiking, belaying
and knot tying are necessary skills for any caver doing vertical
work. The hours required give experience and the conservation trip
makes it mandatory to help-a-cave at least once in your subterran-
ean exploits. All in all, a good system; and one I am proud to have
gone through.
