WINTER THE TECH TROGLODYTE
Cava Mapping Trilogy, con't
Reading 'em out and writing 'em down,
Away to the dorm and into the town
Some oil for my boots and a shot for my head,
A drink to the living, a toast to the dead.
ch, the song of the future has been sung,
All the battles have been won,
In the deepest pits we stand,
All of hell at our command,
We have mapped beneath the soil,
With our teardrops and our toil.
Oh, there was a time in this fair land when the sinkholes were
not plumbed,
When wild, unbanned bats flew alone against the sun,
I ong before manila rope and boots with nails of steel,
When the dark stalagmite forests were too distant to be real,
When the dark stalagmite forests were too distant to be real,
Put still there's many a passageway, too distant to be real.

TYE TWEI:VE DAYS OF CHRISTLAS
(Caver's Version)
Last verse:
On the twelfth day of Christmas my true love gave to me:
12 calcite crystals
11 miner's hard hats
10 pounds of guano
9 piton hammers
8 carabiners
... 7 monkey's waiting
6 bats a winging
5 cans of beer
4 carbide lamps
3 meat balls
2 rubber bands and a cougar in a pine tree,
