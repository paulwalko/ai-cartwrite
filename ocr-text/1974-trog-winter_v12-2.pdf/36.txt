THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1974
REDNECKS, WHITE SOX AND
BLUE RIBBON BEER.
There's no place that I'd rather be then right here
With my redneck, white, sox and blue ribbon beer.
Barmaid is mad cause some guy made a pass
Jukebox is playin there stands a glass
And the cigarette smoke kinda hangs in the air
My redneck, white sox and blue ribbon beer.
A cowboy is cussin the pinball machine
A drunk at the bar gettin noisy and mean
Some guy on the phone says "I'll be home soon dear".
My redneck, white Sox and blue ribbon beer.
*No we don't fit in with that white collar crowd
We're a little too rowdy and a little too loud
There's no place that I'd rather be then right here
My rednecks, white sox and blue ribbon beer.
Semi's a passin on the highway outside
The 4:30 crowd is about to arrive
The sun's goin down and we'll all soon be here
My rednecks, white sox and blue ribbon beer.
There's no place that I'd rather be then right here
My rednecks, white Sox and blue ribbon beer.
