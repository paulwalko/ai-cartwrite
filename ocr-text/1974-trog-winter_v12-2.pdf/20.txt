THE TECH TROGLODYTE
3).

5).
Passed out? Well, not really; just a minor heart attack as
my inexperienced brain told me that the things that I would have to
do would take (if even possible) forever. This is what was re-
quired of me (paraphrased):
1). Spend forty hours underground on at least six trips over
a period of at least one quarter and write a trip report about one
of the trips.
2). Have a working knowledge of carbide lamps.
Demonstrate.certain climbing abilities,
4). Demonstrate correct belaying techniques,
Demonstrate rappeling and prussiking.
6).
Beable to tie an array of knots and know what they are
good for,
7). Take a general comprehensive test concerning cave-related
subject matter.
8). Go on a conservation trip.
I also had to be endorsed by a member in good standing and then be
approved by a two-thirds majority of the club, Starting from zero,
and without having had any real previous experience in caving of
this manner, it seemed like a lot to do.
But I preserved. I was sufficiently enthused with the caving
experience that I went on. Week by week. I mounted up the hours
and aocomplishments. On my third trip I went on an eight and a
half hour trip to Miller's Cove where I was able to fulfill the
climbing requirement. As time flew by I did little in the way of
requirements; I just caved;
It was the beginning of the second quarter when it became
apparent that I was nearing the required number of hours and would
have to get moving on those other requirements, So I: did, in a
manner not unlike a chicken: with its head cut off, I scrambled
around conning or cornering members into teaching me something of
importance or taking me to do something.
I had accomplished. my rappeling on my fourth trip when I went
to Newberry's, but had not yet gotten my prussiking done so I con-
vinced Cheryl to go to Pig Hole with me two weeks before I would
come up for membership. At Pig Hole Cheryl and I rappeled in, I
prussiked out, rappeled back in, and then went out on her cam rig.
A nice, quick trip.
One week before the date I wished to come up for membership,
I went to Newberry's and covered my conservation trip requirement,
It was a fun trip cleaning up carbide, scraping walls and trying
to pull all: the spent carbide up the 165 foot pit,
Next on my agenda was the knot requirement. Hesitant at first,
I approached a member and asked to be shown the knots. I went to
several people and got a fair briefing of what was expected of me
and, four days before my scheduled date, I confronted a member in
his room and preceeded to show him everything I knew about knots,
I did a fair job of it, managing to show him a few knots that he
did not know and baffling him with a thieves knot. To those who
are not familiar with this system, I had to know the Following knots:
Bowline, Boline on a Coil, Prussik, Fisherman's knot, Clove Hitch,
Sheet Bend, Butterfly, Square Knot, Figure of Eight, and Figure
of Eight Loop. None of this was too difficult,
