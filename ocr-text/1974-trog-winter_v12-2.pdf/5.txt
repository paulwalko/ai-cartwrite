MADAME VICE: The club got what it voted for last spring when it
elected Cheryl Jones as Vice President.. "Madame Vice" has been
doing a first class job handling the responsibilities of her office.
Not only has she been seeing to the training of the large number
of trainees we have had this year, but with help from Herb Safford
Safety Committee Chairman, Cheryl has been working on various pro-
jects for the club as a whole. Early in the fall a rescue roster
and procedure was prepared and distributed to the club as well as
other caving organizations through-out the eastern U.S. Clever
negotiations on the part of Cheryl has obtained a stokes litter for
the grotto. But it does not sit around waiting to be used in a
rescue. Cheryl has spent many of her free Sundays out at Maybrook
sinkhole with the stokes, instructing interested trainees and
members in vertical techniques, rigging, rescue procedures, and
pulley systems. Not a week goes by without some sort of handout
on valuble caving information from the desk of our hard working
vice president. A few weeks ago Cheryl received a letter from
Donna Mrcozkowski, Chairwoman of the N.S.S. Safety and Techniques
Committee, praising Cheryl and the grotto for the work done in the
interest of safe caving. Keep up the good work, Cheryl.
