ROCKY MOUNTAIN HIGH

He was born in the summer of his 27th year
Coming home to a place he'd never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key to every door

When he first came to the mountains his life was far away
On the road and hanging by a song..
but the string's already broken and he doesn't really care
He's changin' fast and it won't last for long
And the colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it raining fite in the sky
Shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullabye
Rocky Mountain high in Colorado
He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
They say that he got crazy once and tried to touch the sun
He lost a friend but kept a memory
He walks in quiet solitude 'mid forests and the stream
Seeking. grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serinity of a clear blue mountain lake
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
Talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky Mountain high in Colorado
Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down
To bring in a couple more
More people, more scars, upon the land
Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
Know he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly
Rocky Mountain high in Colorado
It's a Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
Friends around the campfire and everybody's high
Rocky Mountain high in Colorado
Rocky Mountain high in Colorado
Rocky Mountain high.
