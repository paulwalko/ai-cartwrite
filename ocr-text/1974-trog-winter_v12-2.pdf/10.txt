Biospeleology AT VEN:
(The Worki of Perry Co Ho??)
by ROBYN L. LOUD
Note: Ferry C. Holt is a Frofessor of zoology
at V.F.I.S.U. Interviews for this article
were held with hin as well as with Lynn
Ferguson, a graduate student under Dr. Molt.
As a graduate student Dr. Holt's interest in the study of
invertibrates led him to specialized researching or the
Branchioldellids (Fhyllum Annelida). He has, since then, set
his goals to classify these animals as well as define their
geographic range and elucidate their evolutionary significance.
Included in this research Dr. Holt has studied cave related
species and has written a paper concerning those of Eastern
North Ainierica.
Branch íoldellids are seginented, leech-like worms which
live on crayrish and other crustaceans. ost are harmless
commensals, being carried "piggy back," but a few are parasitic.
They can live either inside or out oi caves, but a few
troglobitic species do exist.
Dr. Holt does not collect his own specimens but receives
research speci:nens from other biospeleologists in such states
as Tennessee, Virginia, Florida, Kentucky and Indiana.
Specimens received are prepared by Dr. Wolt and technicians
as whole mounts. In this way they may be viewed and studied
from either side.
A few biospeleologists who have worked with Dr. Holt and
who have their own projects include Dr. John R. Holsinger, John
and iartha Cooper, Dr. Laurence E. Fleming, Dr. Torton "I. Hobbs,
Barry lansell, Dr. Kenneth Relyea and Dr. Harrison R. Steeves.
Dr. Holsinger is, at this time, working with Dr. Holt to have
a list oſ cave invertebrates published by V.F.I.S.U. Lynn
Ferguson, as well as other graduate students here at Tech. also
have work that directly or indirectly involves that of Dr.
Holt's and other cave studies.
on GOASZYvaion :
As a side note Lynn was asked, concerning cave conservation,
iſ he thought cave collecting or biological specimens constituted
cave vandalism. He replied that it coes ir an area is over-
collected or does not need collecting. His advice to fellow
cavers is to report sightings of interesting cave life to
someone who is studying it. This person should try to cetermine
whether the organism is required ior research and in what numbers.
IT ſauna or flora are taken out oi a cave when the numbers of
the species is small, extinction of that species is the probable
result.
