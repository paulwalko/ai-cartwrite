Another motif involves that of the supernatural: "haunted"
caves or fabulous creatures. Devil's Slide (Higgingbottom #1 ) in
Tazewell County, is avoided by the local residents because they
are convienced that some loathsome creature lives at the bottom.
Periodically, strange noises come out of it. Stoven's Cave,
Kentucky is also avoided because of "Screaming Willie's Entrance"
from which it is possible to hear screams, moans, and other weird
noises,
Caves have traditionally been the hiding place of outlaws and
treasure, Buzzard's Roost. (or Devil's Den) at Fancy Gap, Virginia
was reputedly the hide out of the notorious Allen Clan after they
"shot up" the Hillsville Courthouse in 1912, Supposedly, Sidna
Allen hid a considerable amount of money there, but most people :
don't look for it because of the "bottomless pits" and the rattle-
snakes." An interesting local story involves one of the small
numerous caves near Mountain L ke, in Montgomery County. À Union
general was given a gold plated cannon by his men.. while he was
retreating before the Confederate army, the cannon, either too
large to transport quickly, or the general fearing capture, was
hiddeen in a cave and is still there,
The Indian Burial Cave is also a popular story. For instance,
last year I was told of a cave in Russell County with a 250 foot
entrance.drop, and with a floor that was covered with pink Indian
skulls and artifacts, that had been there so long that they were
coated with calcite, -
Other miscellaneous interesting stories are told about caves.
New River Cave, according to local legend, was used as a church
during pioneer days. If one knows where to look, they might
possibly find bits of wood that were once pews, 14. Pighole, in
Giles county, is supposed to be the tomb of Earl Potterfield's
wandering pig. +
Essencially, the folklore involving caves is very interesting
and apparently unexplored. The roister of known Virginia caves
contains names (such as Bear's Den, Better Forgotten, Bottomless
Pit, Brass Kettle Hole, Cemetery, Dead Cow, Devil's Hole, Ely's
Moonshine, Kagey Skull and Bones and Soldier's) that imply a
potentially rich source of folklore.
