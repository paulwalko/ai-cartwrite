cliques is that they are not divided over caving techniques or
Region politics, but rather over the fact that the. "Front-of-the-
Room" clique does not want to party with the "Back-of-the-Room"
clique. This was made very clear at a party at Hall's, where the
"Front-of-the-Room" clique split the party and the club in half.
I later heard that the excuse of lack of space was used, but I've
seen 15 cavers hold a party in a van, vind it's strange that these
people didn't think of this when Hall offered his residence as a
party place..
This may sound petty to some, but if you agree with my fore-
going remarks about partying, you may sense something serious here.
When a new trainee comes to our meetings, he just might see
almost anything. But even if his first meeting is a bitter fight
over a constitutional amendment, if he goes to a party afterward
and sees the whole grottoe raising hell together, he just might
decide that we're a pretty together group of people. But if after
a meeting, no matter how pleasant, he finds that the club has
split into two groups that have no desire to socialize with each
other, what the hell is he going to think of us then?
Maybe things aren't quite that bad yet, and maybe they never
will be. I certainly hope not. But remember this. The number of
people on this campus who go caving is larger than our own member-
ship and they're increasing every year. That new trainee doesn't
have to come to us, but we do need him. And it is my opinion that
if we don't present him with a unified club with good fellowship as
well as good caving, we'r not going to get that trainee.
Think about it, .
