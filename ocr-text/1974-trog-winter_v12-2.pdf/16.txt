I would now like to conclude with a few additional precautions
concerning those who plan to explore. within this creatures domane.
First of all, do not be frightened by any peculiar sounds which
you may hear. It is most likely only a 28.4 foot salamander

it's favorite foods. Offerings should thus be carried at all

do a summersault, landing on your back and play dead. The beast
should now depart in order to mourn the loss of it's lover,
If not, well,... thats life now, isn't it?
