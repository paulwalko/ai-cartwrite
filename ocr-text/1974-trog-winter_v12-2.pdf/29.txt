Bob Mead hurriedly scrambled down the drop, loaded down with
all the gear deemed necessary to rescue me from my predicament.
He then went into the drain to retrieve my gloves, which I had
lost in my haste to save myself. He didn't bother to check for
luminescence since I was already back at the rope preparing to
climb.
I've now had time to sit back and reflect on the incident,
wondering whether there was bioluminescence. At the time, I would
have sworn to it--if just to save face for my suprised reaction.
The phosphenes were very prominent and I had to mentally screen
them out to observe the bioluminescence. Were the spots phos-
phenes? Was it an extrapolation effect of my brain or an actual
phenomena? A future trip to the bottom of Shovel Pit may resolve
these questions...
Editor's note: Although this article was heavily edited to
facilitate comprehension, certain portions were left intact to
reflect the author's personality and character. We are curious,
however, as to the manner that Mr. Ortiz extrapolates his brain.
Perhaps he will demonstrate this ability to us some time.
