COMMENTS:
Pretty good trip, though a bit long. Covered about
4,000 miles of main passage. As yet I have found nothing
virgin, but then I haven't checked any side leads yet...
Emerged from second entrance in Fairbanks. Noticed
considerable temperature drop during the course of the trip;
from 40° in D.C. to -240 here. Carbide lamps have a tendancy
to freeze up quickly!
The cave formations are quite curious and defy standard
explanation. There are millions of beautiful stalactites,
but virtually no stalagmites. Flowstones are also numerous,
but can be treacherously slippery.
Extremely vandalized... Estimate an average depth of two
to three feet of spent carbide... Good conservation trip for
trainees. Extreme caution must be exercized, however, in
removing spent carbide, due to the presence of a local
troglobytic species ; Ursus arctos. Usually dormant at this
time of year, they can be quite nasty when disterbed.
By the way, I soloed this trip. Anybody who doesn't
like it can see me about it.
A.M.F.,
Pete
