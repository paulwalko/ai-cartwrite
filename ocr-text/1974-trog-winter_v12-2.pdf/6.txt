WINTER
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1924
The Fall Project was again held in Smyth County on November 10.
Tom Calhoun organized the undertaking. A night of camping at

the N.S.S. Convention. Mike, Ed and Pete continued on to Alaska,

Pete Schnaars went out looking for someplace to go to school

breakfast. We here at VPI upon receipt of this news feel that we

to go north and sitting for days at a time in the library staring
at maps of Alaska.

to Lawrence, Kansas before Banquet and returned with 38 cases of
Coors. What classi

in this Trog.
Dale Parrott and Ken Sanford visited Mexico over Christmas.
Tom Calhoun attended the International Speleological Congress
in Czechoslovakia this past summer and discovered that the Trog
was well known over there. Communication? No problem--Tom learned
all the words he needed; beer, wine and coffee...
NEW CLUB POLICY: In the way of new club policy we have the follow-
ing;
A change in Bylaw 5, section 1, which now reads; "The President
shall appoint a person to keep and maintain the club files."
A suggestion was made to have trainees present their own ideas
for conservation projects in completing their trainee requirements.
The club has gone on record as to being opposed to the pub-
lication of the new Caves of Virginia.
New policy from the equipment committee concerning unreturned
equipment is as follows:
