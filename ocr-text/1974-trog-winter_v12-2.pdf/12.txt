When I first came to the cave club, I was a typical frat man.
And after caving every weekend for a month and a half, I was a typ-
ical frat man with some caving experience. But by the end of fall
quarter I was that familier sight, a dedicated V.P.I. caver. This
rapid metamorphosis was not due solely to caving; that by itself
was insufficient. It required that spark of fellowship provided
by that often-abused Cave Club tradition, the party,
Now, don't get me wrong. My premise is not that partying is
or should be the main activity of the grottoe.. Nor do I speak
from the stance of the non-caving party goer, I'll stack my fall
quarter hours against anyone. But the time has come for a defense
of the partying tradition of the V.P.I. grottoe.
How many cavers do you know? On a region-wide or national
basis, I know a hell of a lot of cavers, most of whom I met at one
form of party or another. Since then, I've been caving with many
of them, but by no means all. But even those I haven't been caving
with I .count as friends, and in many of my years as a caver, I
have noticed a rule of behavior that seems to apply to other cav-
ers as well as myself. The rule is "YOU ARE MOST LIKELY TO GO
CAVING WITH CAVERS YOU ENJOY OTHER SOCIAL CONTACTS WITH." I mod-
estly call this rule CONEFREY'S CONCEPT. Now if I'm correct about
this, (and I think I am), then I think it's safe to state that the
opposite is also true: "YOU ARE LEAST LIKELY TO CAVE WITH CIVERS
YOU DO NOT ENJOY OTHER SOCIAL CONTACTS WITH." This I modestly
call CONEFREY'S COROLLARY(?).. And both CONEFREY'S CONCEPT and
CONEFREY'S COROLLARY can be simplified in the following statement;
"The Cavers that party together, cave together."
By this time you may have noticed that I consider the party to
be an important part of the Cave club life. Why is this?, you ask.
Simple, The V.P.I. Grottoe is a social organization. That's right.
We're just as much a social organization as any of the social
frats. It may be hard for some people to face, but the V.P.I.
Grottoe is not The Cave Research Foundation. We are not a scienti-
fic organization of speleologists, but a social organization of
spelunkers,
But this is a good thing. In the college environment we func-
tion in, the only organizations that are able to attract and hold
totally dedicated members are those organizations with a complete
and all inclusive social life. This has worked for the Grottoe
in the past, and I believe the Region and the N.S.S. have done
well by us, too. We may not be the C.R.F., but we're the kind of
organization which produces the dedicated speleologists they and
others need. And I maintain that our tradition of partying is a
major part of the socializing which is so important to our Grottoe.
Now to get to the point. This past fali, two cliques devel-
oped in the club, and they could be roughly seperated by noticing
who sat where at meetings. Thus we have what I call the "Front-of-
the-Room" Clique and the "Back-of-the-Room" clique. Now the cave
Club has always had cliques but what disturbs me about these
