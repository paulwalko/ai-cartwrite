THE TRANES SYSTEM
AS A WAY OF LIFE
BY LOR VINDLE
I am sure that you Grotto'ers know what the trainee system
is. For you this article will let you know my basic experiences
with it while I was entraped as a neophyte,
For any readers who do not know what the trainee system is,
either in general or in specific points, this article will give
you a (hopefully) better impression and understanding of what,
precisely, it is.
It all starts out, as all things must, with a first: the
first meeting, in this case. I had seen an advertisement for the
Cave Club in Squires Student Center and was convinced by an acquaint-
ance that attending the meeting would be better than doing nothing
on Friday night, Upon opening the door at the meeting place, one
is (at least I was) assailed by both apprehension and wonder. In
all the chairs are multitudes of laughing, grinning people while
elsewhere people are running across the stage and jumping up and
down. In the middle of the aisle, this big, hulking, : brute with
long hair and baggy pants is passing out papers. It turns and ap-
proaches. As I stand there too terrified to move, this person hands
me some papers, tell me her name is Cheryl and that it is good to
see me, Numbed by all this, I sit down and fill out a questionaire
and read over the other papers. The meeting is called to order and
things quiet down, comparatively. Nothing extraordinary occurs and
following the meeting I and my companions attempt to try to find
someone to take us caving. le succeed at cornering someone and
arrange to go caving the next day.
So I went to my first cave. Some little hole in the ground
called Old Mill. Slime. Het and slimy. Water up to the neck.
All in all, quite an experience...and very exhilerating.
Thus was formed the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Hy
subterranean brothers sending me their voiceless summons; driving
me deeper and deeper (actually, as was once pointed out to me, it
is a logical step from the sewers of Arlington to the Caverns of the
Blacksburg region). Quickly then the weeks past. Trip by trip I
became a little more adept at caving. Finally, near the end of
January, the dream of every trainee came true: I was voted in as
a member of the grotto. How did this come about? How was I able
to turn myself from a mild, meek (Clark Kent) skill-less novice in-
to a bold; brazen (you know the analogy) caver? For that matter,
how does anyone become a caver? :
That is the article, then; The how (and perhaps the why) of
becoming a member, It all starts at that first meeting when you
have the courage and two dollars simultaneously agreeing to pay
for dues for the quarter. Dues are payed and, in exchange, you re-
ceive a three page collection of papers with your name at the top.
Somewhere along the way you are informed that this is the trainee
sheet and in order to qualify for membership you have to accomplish
everything that is listed on those pages. So I immediately sat
down, looked over the sheet and passed out from shock.
