Certainly an event to remember, the Ninth annual Banquet of
the V.P.I. Cave Club of the N.S.S. was held in Squires Student
Center on Febuary 9, 1974, in the monsterous Old Dominion Ballroom.
Members from such grottoes as Holston Valley, Smokey Mountain, D.C.,
Carta Valley S.W.C.K.S., Huntsville and Greenbriar, as well as from
A.M.C.S., P.S.C., and the New Orleans Speleological Society at-
tended...who could ask for more?: Tuna Johnson was our man with the
words of guidance for those gathered. .
: Bill Deane, the guest speaker, gave an excellent presentation
on the caves in the Guadalupes and near Carlsbad. With the magnif-
icent slides topped off with a very good talk, we were constantly
spellbound. Some of the cave systems in our area could probably
fit into just one of the colossal formations found in the caves of
that area.
After Bill Deane's paramount slide show, awards were presented
to distinguished individuals and groups. The first being to Lynn
Richardson, honored with the Heat Award. She received a Hornome ter
letting any male bystanders know ċf, her present state of horniness.
About this time, Ken Sanford decided to take a rest and promptly
passed out on the floor to the snapping of camera shutters. Jim
Hixon soon did likewise, Dale parrott was another victim of the
Awards Committee and for his ever continuing effort to map New River
Cave, Dale received the Slowly But Surely Awards: This award con-
sisted of a small shovel (more like a spoon) to that unfound, booming
passagei.
Mike Wolf, to follow up Robyn Loud and her Flame ward, re-
ceived the Glowing Ember of the Year for hismany spectacular: drunks,
Since he usually sits in the corner quitely drunk or sober, he re-
ceived a meter to inform his friends as to his condition ranging
anywhere from alcohol free ito dead drunk.
To the man who loves to map the most.miserable cave possible,
Robins Rift, Keith Ortiz received the Die Hard Caver Award: With
this he got a poster to draw his map on, two spinners, one to tell
the direction of the passage, the other tells the distance of his
passage. This device will save untold misery from people who might
be conned into going to Robin's Rifti
Funa didn't escape the awards committee this year, eitheri he
received the Almost But Not Quite Award. For his attempts in many
areas he was given computer printouts of his not quite so successful
adventures.
For keeping the V.P.I. "rescue team" on its toes with his late
arrivals from cave trips, Bob Alderson accepted the Better Late
Than Never Award. His habit of returning after his time due back
got him à telephone (two beer cans connected by a string) to take
with him to let the cavers on campus know his status.
In a time when oil is truely "ligud gold", Jerry Redder likes
leaving an oil trail everywhere he goes. He liked to drive his car
over manhole covers that were one inch higher than his oilpan.
