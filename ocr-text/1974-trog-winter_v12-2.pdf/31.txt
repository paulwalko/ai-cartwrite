AMAZING GRACE
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see .
T'was grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fear releived
How: precious did that grace appear :
The hour I first believed
Through many dangers, toils, and snares,
I have already come
T'was grace that brought me safe thus far
And grace shall lead me on.
When we've been here ten thousand years
Bright Shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun.
........ SHIT!!
AHHHHHHHHHH..
(As told to us by Doug Perkins)
