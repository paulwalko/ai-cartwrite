WINTER
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1974
This gave rise to another new award entitled "You Can't Push Willy
Where Willy Won't Go".
To the people who have dedicated their time and often more to
the grotto, the Committee showed their appreciation by giving out
Guano Clusters. Bob. Barlow received a cluster for instructing members
in Red Cross First Aid, Tom Calhoun for his work in organizing the
club's fall project and editing the Tech Troglodyte, and Ed and Liz
Morgan for hosting Fall project (supplying food, beer and hospital-
ity). Doug Yeatts received only one half of a cluster for his work
on building new ladders for the club. He'll get the other half when
he completes the ladders!
Â· ViP.I. cavers do honor the senior citizens of their group.
Herb Safford was honored with the Old Man Caver Award, a.staff to :
help him on his way and a tube of Musterol to ease those aching bones.
Bruce Byrd and his devious way of using carbon paper, managed
to convince Tuna to sign his resignation as president of the grotto,
This was more of an award to the club than to Tuna!
This year's new member to the honored society of armchair cavers
went to Bob Page, Rolf McQueary welded a fantastic sculpture of a
caver in a chair with a glass of beer in hand, .
Dubious Achievement Awards were presented to various individ-
uals and groups for some deserving act: D.C. Speleograph an
award their cover calling themselves the real cavers" and dropping
a two ton hint that we were "frat cavers". Paul Broughton (VPI 119)
was recognized for his dubious achievement that appeared in the
Mineralogical Record. Paul advertised for speleothems to be sent to
him to study, P.S.C. received an award for organizing the Virginia
Region Project at Simmons-Mingo cave into a grand folley: Cheryl
Jones earned her dubious achievement award at the edge of Fantastic
Pit when she ignited the highly flamable three day old bag of shit.
Bobbi Nagy received the award for relieving her Self into Tom
Williams' lap. For hosting a New Years party from his death bed
(almost), Tom Roehr was duly awarded. And last, but by all means
not least, Greenbrier Grotto fell fate to Jim Hixon and thus also
to the appropriate award.
The Brainbucket, given to an individual to protect what little
isleft between the ears, was presented to Cheryl Jones for falling
30 feet to the lip of a 160 foot: pit in Newberry's Cave, ..
The trainees of the club finished off the awards with the tra-
ditional door prize, and then some. The door prize was a giant
repair kit for that giant carbide lamp, consisting of a 1.5 foot
diameter felt, 8 inch diameter tip, and a 1.5. diameter gasket.
To Cheryl Jones they gave a bra with two balloons to add body. This
was to help her flirting techniques. The members of the grotto were
given two gallons of water from Pig Hole to put the caving spirit
back into their bodies on those mornings after a party.
The Trainee of the Year award was given to Lor Windle. This
is awarded to an outstanding trainee; one who not only proves to
be an enthusiastic caver, but who also shows to be a great potential
asset to the clubi Lor defina tely falls into this category.
Everyone a journed to party for the rest of the night and morning,
trying hard to forget the atrocious meal we were served.
