THE DEVIL 4T AIRPORT ROAD
(To the tune of "Thunder Road")
I can tell a story, I can tell it right,
About the VP Cave Club, and their meeting Friday night,
Moose he chaired the business, Lynn she took the notes,
Doug inducted trainees, and Mike helped to count the votes.
Owners got their valentines, so they wouldn't get up tight,
Trip reports were given, as they told about some pit,
Some times when they were lucky, then the LA gave a skit.
CHORUS:
And there was singing, singing, over lirport Road,
Caving was their pastime, they were adventurous and bold,
And there was caving, caving, it worked up quite a thirst
The Iord he swore he'd get them, but the devil got them first.
8:30 in the evening, it was on a Friday night,
The business was all finished, and a party was in sight,
The cavers grabbed their quitars, harmonicas and booze,
And hit Yh"CAMS, with no time left to lose.
Starting out with "Rider", and right on down the list,
They sang out every song they knew, and then the few they'd missed.
They finally came to "Falcon", and "Charlotte" sounded Swell
The "Friggin' Wheel" burst into flames, they were singing bent for
Â· Hell.
CHORUS
Roaring out of Flacksburg, out on 81
They headed for the underground, when Friday fun was done,
In Broncos and VW's, wherever caving led,
Those cavers took some roads, that even angels fear to tred,
Now I have told my story, I haven't told it all,
About the VP Cave Club, who drank lots of alchool
They left the town at sunrise, that's all there is to say,
Yurgover explorations were in store for Saturday,
CHORUS
"Boots"
