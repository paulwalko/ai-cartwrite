WINTER
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
3 HUH?
23 POINT

The year is almost over and this is the last column that
I get to write. I'm sort of at a loss at what to say because
I seem to have mixed feelings about everything. However, as I
sit and think about the past year, I will say one thing-it has
been different. About the past year though...
The VPI Grotto, of the NSS has a constitution. On the first
page in the second paragraph, the purpose of the club is stated.
It is "to promote interest in, and to advance the science of
speleology; to encourage fellowship amoung cavers and to promote
conservation of caves and safety in their exploration." At this
point I ask myself "Have we as a club done our part in fulfilling
the original purpose of the club?" Sometimes I wonder when
searching back through all.of the various happenings during the
past year. The trainee sessions and programs--did we really help
the trainees? Could we have made a more concentrated effort to
get in contact with those society members and free lance cavers
on campus who are genuinely interested in caving? Did we inherit
the caliber of people that we want to lead the club tomorrow?
The project-- did we help the science of speleology or did we
retard the idea of conservation? The banquet-- did we really bring
out the idea of fellowship?
To the sophomores and juniors all I can say is -- whatever
your answers are, you're the one's who will be guiding the club in
the near future. This club has weathered a lot in the last thirty
years, and I think that there isn't too much that will bring it to
its knees... However, to those who lead the club and to those who
think they have the answers, my one suggestion is to listen to the
opinions of people outside the club, in the region and the country.
You might be surprised at what they have to say about the Grotto.
Then ask yourself, honestly, do they have good reason for saying
what they do? Again, you might be surprised. Think about your
relationship with the club and how you might help or hinder the
club's relationships, impressions, and progress with the society.
Then go forward from there--not backward.
Good luck,
TUNA
