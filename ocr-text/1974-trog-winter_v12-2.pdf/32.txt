CAVE VAPPING TRILOGY
(To the tune of the "Canadian
Railroad Trilogy")
There was a time in this fair land when the sinkholes were not
plumbed
When wild, unbanded bats flew alone against the sun,
I ong before marila rope and boots with nails of steel,
When the dark stalagmite forests were too distant to be real.
But time has no beginning and history has no bounds,
4s to this limestone country they came from all around,
They probed into her sinkholes, and they walked the ridges tall,
Made friends with cave owners for the good of us all.
And when the young man's fancy was turning in the spring,
The caving men grew restless for to hear the brakebars sing
Their minds were overflowing with the visions of their day,
And many a passage was found and lost, and stations marked the way.
For they looked to the future and what did they see;
They saw cavers mapping from the fore to the lee,
Bringing the news to the hard workin' crew,
Drawing with care all that was new.
I ook away, said they, across this, karst-filled land,
At the caves that dot the Eastern limestone band,
Bring in the mappers and set up base camp,
Set a hundred stations with a carbide lamp,
Open your heart, let the lifeblood flow,
We gotta get on our way''cause we're mapping too slow,
We gotta get on our way 'cause we're mapping too slow.
Behind the wide Blue Ridge, the sun in declining,
Stars, they come stealing at the close of the day,
Across the wide valleys, our loved ones lie sleeping,
Beyond the cold rock, in a place far away.
We are the cavers who survey the passage,
Reading our bruntons, never seeing the sun
Iiving on jerky and drinking cheap wine,
Cracking our heads till the big map is done,
We are the cavers who survey the passage,
Reading our bruntons, never seeing the sun,
Setting belay bolts and wading the pools,
Cracking cur heads till the big map is done.
So it's over the breakdown and crawl through batshit
Into the siphon and into the pit,
Un the main drag and around all the bends,
Reading and taping all the way to the end.
