An Observer's Trip To
THE GREENBRICK SYSTÉM:
. by Joe Saunders
As a caver interested in the nature of large cave systems, I
recently arranged with the D.C. Grotto to go with them on a survey
trip into the Greenbrier System. A preliminary chat with Ray Cole
and my trip leader, Paul Stevens, informed me that the system as
presently known really appears to be two hydrosystems connected in
one area. We were to remap some passages formerly surveyed inac-
curately by WVACS. Our party of two three man teams entered the
Humphrey entrance, and stayed together except for the surveying in
adjacent passages. The Humphrey entrance led two hundred feet
through a 3'x3' gravel and pool floored passage to the French Con-
nection, which is a dry bypass of a wet, often debris-choked tight
crawlway. The Humphrey entrance takes part of the wet weather
drainage of a surface area of several acres or more. The cave for
several hundred feet inside the entrance displays many alternate
routes for water flow, most of these being enlarged joints too small
for passage. This complex pattern of small holes and fissures
probably ca“: be attributed to the solutional ability of aggressive
surface runoff backing up in flood times behind inadequate con-
ducts near the entrance: the input exceeds the output and in this
perched situation, where water which gets past the bottlenecks can
descend fairly quickly to base level, the small holes are responses
of backed up water to a bottleneck. This situation is similar in
ways to complex passage patterns formed by water diverted by break-
down in Blue Spring Cave in Indiana and Grady's Cave in Kentucky,
although in these two cases the developement occured at base level.
In the French Connection is one of these enlarged joints in
the Humphreys entrance route, which has been further enlarged to
body demensions by by chiseling. Two of us had to remove our
coveralls, which left me going through in my bare skin, and I still
took fifteen minutes to go three feet,
After the Connection, we proceeded through several hundred
feet of crawl and canyon, picked up a stream, dropped twenty feet
alongside a waterfall, and after additional hundreds of feet of
canyon and stoopway, descended the 35 foot drop where the entrance
stream had found the large 20'x25' trunk of Humphrey's.
There followed several thousand feet of large breakdown stream
passage, occasional narrow canyon sections. On the way we passed
the upstream Lipps trunk. This Lipps-Humphrey junction of two major
streams, probably at base level, is the major passage of the
western hydrosystem of the cave. I estimated the stream flow at
the junction to be 0.3-0.5 cubic feet per second, low for this time
of year, I'm told. The terminal siphon of the stream lay several
thousand feet downstream,
After proceeding another thousand feet downstream through
breakdown and over gravel banks, we turned right into a rimstone
