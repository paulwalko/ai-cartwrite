LOOKING FOR CAVES
IN THIS AREA
- By
Tom CACHOUN
When checking out a new area for the possibility of caves, a
caver naturally does not want to waste time in an area that could
not possibly contain caverns. Knowing exactly where one can look
can save time and energy for better things like studying or party-
ing instead of wrestling the mountain laurels or kicking the cows
in an area where the only subterranean caverns that can exist are
groundhog holes. This article may help the non-geologically orient-
ed members of our group who have found asking the local geologist
only gets them more confused with a geological history starting
with the Algoman orogeny,
Topo-maps can be very useful for finding potential areas,
Such features as springs, disappearing streams, sinkholes or the
absence of surface drainage indicate a karst region as everyone
knows. Names on topo-maps given by locals also give hints to cave
regions, names like "Sinking Creek" and "Cave. Spring", Valleys
named like "Rich Valley" has limestone, where as "Foor Valley" or
"Poverty Hollow" have non-cave forming rock. Limestone and dolo-
mite valleys got named by the farmers "Rich Valley" because
good, rich soil is formed, as opposed to "Poor Valley" which has
shale and sandstone and produces poor soil..
In this vicinity, there are two kinds of ridges, the difference
being which of two kinds of weather resistant rocks form them,
Mississippian, or Silurian age. On the ridges held up by Silurian
age rocks, such as Walker Mountain, the steeper side of these
ridges and the valley adjacent contain most of our caves.
How far to walk up the ridge is a good question to ask since
the slopes often get quite steep and covered with bramble and the
crest in the clouds. As it turns out the cave producing formations
generally don't get very close to the top at all, usually they end
a little way above the base of the mountain. There is an easy way
to tell where the cave producing formations end and that is by
looking at the soil. As one climbs up the base of the mountain
the soil will change color depending on which formation underlies
it. The last cave forming formation produces a distinct reddish
brown soil, the formation itself appears as a maroon-gray to light
pink. Right above the red band of soil one will find a yellow :to
tan color, representing the next formation which is a non-cave.
producing formation. So when the soil changes from a reddish
brown to yellow the chance of finding a cave decreases greatly,
Look just a little higher up the ridge in case Ã  collapse in a
cave producing formation causes an opening in the non-cave zone.
This change almost always is close to the base, not near the top.
Maybe this information will help one become more efficient in
finding caves, such as during projects. Before going tramping in
the boonies, look for any previous record of existing caves and if
any ridge walking has been done in the area, it may not need to be
looked over anymore. When out on the ridge Saturday morning with
a Friday night hangover, you don't want to go stumbling over the
rugged terrain, fighting the rattlesnakes or the snow in an area
of no caves if you can help it.
