an extrapolation by Keith Ortiz...
No caver who has experienced the darkness of a lamp explosion
or similar extinguished experiences, cannot repudiate the value of
light. The effects shown by persons deprived of light, illuminate
its importance to man. It is the external stimulus to the retina
of the eye caused by an assemblage of energy waves resulting from
collapsing electron rings. However, the stimulus is more than a
random bombardment, it is subject to human interpretation and reac-
tion. It provides the most important of the 5 (maybe 6) receptors
of external stimulus and without light a person is seriously handi-
capped. Fortunately, even on the most overcast, moonless nights,
nature still provides enough light for essential perception and
artificial light fills the gap for extraordinary perception. In
places where natural light . is not enough for essential lighting ,
artificial means, fill this need to such an extent that when it is
lost, such as in a blackout or lamp explosion, man behaves in
irrational physical and pyschological manners. His minds eye can
take a limited reign. This interpret-reaction effect is accentua-
ted among cavers because of their fetal attachment to their lamps
and the plutonian fear of their surroundings. Visual perception,
the ability to interpret visual inputs as common objects is porpor.com
tional to the amount of light available. For instance, a larger
reflector will allow a caver to see more detail. An upper limit
obviously exists since we can observe the effect of a bright flash
gun. As light intensity drops off, we reach a point where the mind
instead of accepting the limitd information, attempts to extrapol...
ate more than is there, Using guesstimates combined with fears and
expectation, we see people staring in our bedrooms through the
dark windows or movement in a dark corner of a building. In total
darkness our mind is still receiving inputs from the retina.
Called phosphenes, these are the squiggles and spots one sees when
he closes his eyes. Caused by fluid pressures, moving blood and
the like, they cause a visual display in the absence of light, (A
mechanical manipulation of the retina similar to those caused by
probe inserts.). It is with the semi-dark and the total dark that
I recently became interested.
The above explanation of perception, artificial light ect.
is a sort of explanation/description of a recent caving incident in
Salamander Cave located in Giles County. Mike Wolf, Tom Calhoun,
Bob Mead and I were an exploration team in the "pit area" of the
cave, a 409: high 50! by 50!. room with 3-4 coalesced dome pits,
each 20 to 301 high. A high lead off of one pit leads to a "typ-
ical" 6' walkway and a l' crawlway combination which traverses a
20' to 300(?) pit equipped with a stainless steel traverse cable.
It is called appropriately '"Traverse Pit" (I suppose by earlier
explorers). It is within 20' of Shovel Pit which is a 60' high
Canyon. After some preliminary exploration which uncovered working
of earlier explorers, (carved out footholds in a mudfill and a bolt--
carabiner combination) and more leads, I duly volunteered to
descend Shovel Pit. After rigging a t√©nuous combination of 4 swiss
seats, 1 length of pyrlon and and a 70' length of goldlon, I care-
