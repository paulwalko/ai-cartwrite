fully descended. The descent was uneventfull. : The canyon is 60'
to 80' longth a few noted high leads and a high gradient strate
17.01cfs) coming in from the right, flowing along the canyon floor
and disappearing in a mud lined drain of basketball size. Just
before the drain there is an overflow route crawlway with another
yet smaller (hardhats off) overflow route off of it, 'This second
overflow route joins a second stream in a crawlway of decent pro-
portions. Since I was alone, this would be the last crawlway I
would explore before needing moral assistance. ..
The crawlway is a two to three foot high, mud lined drain :
with the small stream cutting a groove on one side of the floor. I
Twenty feet in, one encounters a recently demised bat with his in- :
testines exposed, laying in the middle of the crawl way. I wouldn't
guess as to its fate; perhaps a victim of a cave rat (suck-in
technique #5: expectation). The crawlway narrows down on the other
side of the bat, necessitating a careful negotiation over it...
Cavers, in general, take a special glee in finding some thing
disgusting and uninviting in order to 1) push ahead and bask in
the personal glory of another Mammoth-Flint Ridge connection or,
2) entice someone else in to pushing ahead since you'd still get
part of the glory. However, since I was alone in this uninviting
drain, I pushed ahead. I carefully worked my way over the bat,
looking down to see where to put my knee. The fetal association
I had with my Justrite intensified when it became extinguished.
I decided to back up out of the stream and over the bat in order
to sit at a dry spot to fix my lamp. Unfortunately, my lamp was
not on my hard hat, so I had to crawl back over the bat, with
vivid images of kneeling on it, and grope in the stream for my i
lamp. Finally finding it, I crawled back over the bat again.
Since my other 3 light sources were at the top of the drop, I::..
decided to relight my Justrite.
Judging from the boiling sound issuing from the water com-
partment, I knew that I had to ream the tip in the dark. After
wiping dry the reflector, my hands, and the flint, I was ready
to start. After 4 unsucessful attempts, I decided to rest. I
Sat, staring into the darkness, watching the phosphenes dance in
front of my eyes, when I suddenly realized that I could see my:
hands and helmets I looked around for a rescue, but all I saw
were faint, barely perceptible blue streaks on the walls of the
crawlway. To make sure it wasn't my imagination, I decided to
experiment.
I reached out with my right hand, waving it in front of the
wall, following it with my eyes. Positioning my right hand in
front of me, I took aim with my left hand and reached out, touch-
ing my right hand exactly. After trying this experiment a few
times I decided it was not my imagination, but rather some mat-:
erial on the wall.
Since all attempts to unclog my lamp had failed, I decided
it would be better if I left; Behind me I heard a percolating
sound like a cup of water being poured into the stream. Turning
around, I noticed a bright blue "eye": on the left hand wall,
With the cave horror stories of Rolf McQuery's running through
my head, I decided to let out a subtle blood curdling cry of
