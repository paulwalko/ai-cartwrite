The TTh ABOUT
30 FOOT Salamander
by Rolf McQueary
It has come to my attention throught the past six months
that many grave misconceptions and rumo:rs have developed concern-
ing the alleged thirty foot salamander which abides in Salamander
Cave on Big Walker Mountain. I will, therefor attempt to piece the
facts together and clear up any unconformities which may exist to
date.
First of all the salamander is not thirty feet long. That
indeed would be absurd. It has, instead, been measured to be
exactly 28.4 feet as of it's last molt on March 19, 1974. It
molts approximately six times a year and on Tuesdays. This,
however varies as to season and when new fashon necessitates the
change.
As for sex, this amphibian is female or male and, therefore,
will be refered to as "it" throught the remainder of this article.
Reproduction is assumed to be parthenogenic as this single specimen
appears to be unique. Sexual behavior has been displayed, however,
toward cavers. Few eggs , as yet, have been found, but one should
keep a lookout in such moist areas as the top of dome pits, rim-
stone pools, old discarded garbage bags and the like. The eggs
should be about a foot in diameter and encased in a gellatenous
hammock-like structure as illustrated bellow. (Figure 1)

One excellent location for egg attachment would be between rungs
on a cable ladder. Keeping this in mind one should always be on
the alert when returning up drops. Giant salamander eggs are very
slippery and trecherous. They should, therefore, be removed before
any attempts are made to climb. Danger also exists for those bel
