CAVE LEGENDS OF THE
CENTRAL APPALACHAINS
BY JANICE GOAD
Caves have apparently always had an unsettling affect on Man's
imagination; they have been explored, lived in, painted on, and
written about. Their mystique has had an active influence on Amer-
ican floklore, Almost every cave is reputed to possess a "bottom-
less pit" in which rocks never hit bottom. About equally as ommon
is the "Tom Sawyer" type legend that involves someone becoming lost
and wandering for days before they eventually re-emerge miles
from their original entrance. Cavelegends are most often found in
areas that are geologically blessed with caves, and also among
spelologists and other members of the caving fraternity.
Essentially, in the legends involving caves of the central
Applachians, there appears to be five reoccuring motifs: the "Mur-
der Hole", disappearance and miraculous re-emergence, the super-
natural element, hiding places, and the Indian burial pit,
The "murder hole" motif is one of the most common local legends.
In stories of this type, either someone supposedly has used the
cave as a convenient body disposal, or the cave itself has mur-
dered someone. For example, Goochland Cave, Kentucky, is said to
be the last resting place of a traveling salesman that made him-
self unpopular with the local community. Rumor has it that human
bones were later found by spelunkers. Newcastle Murder Hole
(Craig Co.) has a similar reputation. In the 1800's, an entire
stagecoach, with passengers, was thrown into the cave by rob-
bers.- Catawba Murder Hole, in Botetout County, became famous
through poor road construction and over-indulgence in alcohol.
The cave entrance is at the bottom of a 150 foot sinkhole. The
road split into two lanes and went around the depression. One
night an inebriated farmer driving back from Roanoke maneuvered
his wagon too close to the edge and horses, wagon, and farmer
fell in and were killed, 3 Greenbrier Saltpeter Cave, West Vir-
ginia, developed its entrance when a farmer and his four horse
team plowed over top of it. The horses were killed, but because
the farmer fell on top of them he was uninjured.â€œ
One of the more interesting "Tom Sawyer" type stories
involves Crabtree Cave, in Smyth County. During the Depression,
a man vanished into the cave and was never found again. This
disappearance was doubly distressing, as he had eight hundred
dollars in his pocket (his relatives even had the F.B.I. look-
ing for him.) 5 This same cave had goose heads put into it and
they resurged on the other side of Big Walker Mountain, 6 A dog
that fell into Maxie Knob Pit, Kentucky, emerged at Lawson's
Spring Entrance, two miles and five hundred feet lower.. Legend
doesn't mention whether the dog was still alive or not.? An
old hat thrown into Higginbottom Cave, Tazewell County, came
out eighteen miles away. 0 Local legend tells of a girl who :
became lost in New River Cave, Giles County, and wandered for
days until she came out an entrance near Newport, approximately
eight miles away. As a result of this legend, cavers have been
looking for the lost back entrance to New River for years.
