the climber. A falling egg hitting the lamp of an unwary caver
can quickly .coagulate around the victum's head resulting in shock,
a supressed ego and, in more serious cases, suffocation,
As for morphology. this salamander seems, at first glance, to
hold closely the exterior appearance of Eurycea luciiuga, (the
Cave Salamander). It is the typical orange-red color with black
spots and long tail. As many as two costal grooves are found
between oppressed limbs and the usual barbles can be seen toward
the end of the naso-labial groove. Differences, however, become
quite apparent as one views this creature more closely. It is seen,
for instance, to wear a monocle in it's right eye. Also apparent
are hairy nuckles and digital discs which it is quite fond of
tapping on rocks in times of stress. Other features include the
ability to change color in exact shades with that of the Chatham
Hill formation and a prehensile tail with which it likes to hang
and swing from formations while whistling it's favorite tunes.
Local rumor has it that this beast holds a nasty habit of
riding Walker Valley periodically for the, seemingly, sole purpose
of slurping peoples windows. This has been confirmed by Mr. Zeff
Whittaker, Mr. Frank Vest, and Mrs. Eugene Carr, local residents
of the valley. They report all of their storm windows totally
ripped up and destroyed. (Figure 2) Mrs. Carr reported also of
hearing a "low pitched giggle" and "squeeky crunching sounds like
someone chewing rubber bands."

It was also mentioned that the slimy residue left on the windows
was very difficult to remove. Whether this salamander has the
capability to digest such polyvinyl material is unknown at this time.
