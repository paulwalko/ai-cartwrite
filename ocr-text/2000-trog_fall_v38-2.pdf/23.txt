problem. We loaded up our cafeteria trays as high
as we possibly could, risking pulled muscles and
back sprains under the weight. One of us was
given the Senior Discount; it's up to you to figure
out who.

Once the cafeteria kicked us out, we headed back
to the motel and our reserve of beer. We spent a
good bit of time piled on the beds discussing the
next day's plan. John's great scheme involved
visiting four caves in one day, you'll read how
well that turned out. Finally, the lure of cozy
mattresses, fluffy pillows, and warm blankets
became too much to deny.
FRIDAY, BY AMANDA STILES
I woke up Friday morning with the feeling that
something was amiss. I was not wearing every
piece of clothing that I owned, the ground was
too soft, and the ceiling was way too high. Aha!
I was in the motel room! I was warm, I was clean,
and we had four new caves on the agenda for
today.
We packed up our stuff, pulling the still slightly
wet cave clothes and equipment off of sagging
hangers and the backs of motel chairs. We
packed our cave packs, packed our day packs and
packed the two abused, stuffed-to-overflowing
cars in the parking lot. It was breakfast time, and
for the first time in days somebody else was
going to cook, and better yet somebody else was
going to do the dishes.
We went all out. This would be no measly break-
fast, no half cylinder of oatmeal or half dollar
pancakes, but a full Best Western buffet. Greasy
bacon, salty hash browns, and those oh-so-good
straight from the plastic bottle scrambled eggs.
We stuffed ourselves, hopefully amazing the
waitresses with our stacks of plates and rapid to
and fro to the buffet line. But really, we were
probably lost in the hungry holiday crowd who
felt like they hadn't gotten enough to eat on
Thanksgiving, either.
Our first stop that day was the Park Service sta-
tion in Carlsbad. Eileen and Sandy planned to
thank the people who had given us the permits
and all the much appreciated information on the
caves. Unfortunately the guy wasn't out of that
office; he worked right at Carlsbad Caverns. We
hoped he would be working when we showed up
at the caverns on Saturday.
Then we drove to Slaughter Canyon to begin our
hike to the first cave.
Slaughter Canyon Cave is the site of the Carlsbad
Caverns “Wild Caving” tours, so the path was
well defined as it headed up the side of the can-
yon. It took us a while to get motivated after our
big breakfast, and we spent a long time reorga-
nizing our stuff and getting into our cave clothes.
We lingered and enioved the sunshine. took a
score of silly pictures, and it was late morning by
the time we finally headed off towards the cave.
It was a nice hike up the canyon, slightly steep
but we weren't in a huge hurry. It didn't take long
before we found the entrance to Slaughter Can-
yon Cave (also known as New Cave). We knew
that Wen cave should be nearby, and we walked
up and down the path searching for the side path
that should be there. We heard a yell from Lepera
that he had found a cave, but that it was not the
right one. This cave said Cave 32 on the sign, and
worse yet, it was gated. We were confounded. It
seemed to be in the right place, but the gate and
the name were not right at all. We spent some
more time searching around and then discussed
what to do. We could move onto the next cave
and hope it was not gated also, or we could go
back to the car and check the permits for a com-
bination.
We decided to check the permits for a combina-
tion, worried about the chance that the other
three caves could also be gated. I ran back to the
car with a heavy heart, positive that this was a
