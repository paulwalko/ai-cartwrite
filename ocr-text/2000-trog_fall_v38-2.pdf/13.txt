Cave. With any luck, VPI can stay on good terms
with the NCRC folks.
Wil Orndorff got himself into a nasty predica-
ment while canoeing, caving, and playing in
Pennsylvania when he accidentally poked his leg
with a rusty wire. Strangely, the alcohol he put
into his system that night wasn't able to stave off
the infection, and he wound up in the hospital
with a swollen leg. The leg is now fine, but I'm
not sure about the ego. (He didn't take kindly to,
"Hey, it's pus-boy!")
BRIDGE DAY 2000
VPI managed to put together their own Bridge
Day team this year, and actually got a spot on the
bridge. The final crew: Steve LePera, Craig Rob-
erts, Mark Eisenbees, Eileen O'Malley, Dave
Colatosti, Ko Takamizawa, Eric Stanley, Pete
Sauvigne, Mark Ruocco, Kirk Digby, Jim Pugh,
Ray Sira, and Philip Balister. Pam Mohr and Matt
Mead were on hand to shuttle the rappellers up
to the bridge after each drop. Communication
worked well as there were several amateur radio
geeks on the team, the most recent being Mark E.
(KG4KCN - Kill Cave Nerds).
After much scientific study and careful observa-
tion, a team of top scientists declare that Melba
Williams does indeed prance.
THE REAL NEW MILLENNIUM
There were three major club parties for New
Year's Eve. In Blacksburg, Dave Colatosti and
Patricia Feely offered ice skating on their pond as
a fun alternative to travelling. Joan Johnson and
Ko Takamizawa hosted the Elvis Grotto annual
to-do, and of course Ed and Lynn Richardson
held their usual event. At the Richardson's,
Sandy Peterson took a spill on her way to bed
one night, and spent the next few days hobbling
on loaned crutches. Once home, she went to the
doctor and discovered she had fractured her leg
in two places! Ah, the beauty of alcohol-induced
numbness.
ODDS -N- ENDS
Paige Baldassaro bought herself a motorcycle.
It's probably too late to consider her a dropout,
be she's definitely sporting a leather jacket now-
adays.
Lynn Pirie has graduated and is now working at
an elementary school in Pulaski teaching Special
Ed courses.
The club gained two new members. Kevin Rock
and Mike Cole join the ranks of voting trainees,
still worthy of abuse but able to dish out a bit of
their own. Kevin has taken it seriously, and we
can't seem to make him take a weekend off from
caying.
Carol Zokaites finally got some state funding for
Project Underground. She plans to share office
with Wil Orndorff in Radford. Will they actually
get work done, or spend the days chatting about
their favorite cave trips?
After much scientific study and careful observa-
tion, a team of top scientists declare that Matt
Burnett is still a total geekboy. Fortunately his
reputation is saved by having a sexy bullet head.
Eileen O'Malley joined the ranks of vehicle-roll-
ers in August. She hydroplaned off I-81 and did
a few loops before landing upside down. She was
unhurt, but was suddenly interested in having all
the latest safety features in her replacement car.
Steve LePera and Philip Balister donned ugly
spandex to compete in bicycle races this past
summer. The two managed to eventually cross
the finish line, and neither of them were dead
last. They did look pretty dead-tired by the end,
though. Next summer will show if their biking is
real or just a phase.
