Fluffy that Chris had found earlier. It turned out
that we were right back where we started, at the
Climbing Section. Oh, well. It was fun going that
way anyway.
We decided to go up the Elevator, but we
followed the stream before going up. We went
past the sumps and followed Chris into an
interesting climb above a pool of water in which
we couldn't see the bottom. While clinging to the
rock I thought to myself, “If I fall I'm going to
land in that water and then the cave monsters are
going to get me. This isn't good.” From what I've
heard there are cave monsters. That's why Dave
Colatosti wants to send me into the water-filled
hole in New Starnes. I mean, what's one less
trainee? Luckily I made the climb and continued
+
to follow Chris. Once on the other side we went
through a few small crawls and some climbs only
to have to turn around. I would like to note that
at this point Chris was leading the trip and was
actually pushing holes and trying climbs. I guess
the Pimento Cheese finally kicked in. Mmmmm...
Pimento.... We went back to the Elevator and
climbed back up. Once in the main passage, we
crossed the Butt Ledge and peered into Double
Wells not to be confused with Steve Wells). At
this point in the trip we were pretty tired and
decided to head back out. So, after five hours
underground we collected our gear and climbed
out of the cave. Once changed, Mr. Sizer once
again greeted us. We sat around, enjoyed the day,
and talk for a while. We eventually returned
home, and after I took a hot shower and ate some
food, I fell fast asleep.
