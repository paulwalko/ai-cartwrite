The 350 foot rope was brand new, and had been
living on a spool right up until this trip. Bob and
Sandy, playing the roles of two people who have
never been vertical caving in their lives, pulled all
the rope off the end of the spool (instead of spin-
ning it like they should have) and stuffed it
directly into a rope bag the night before we left.
This created the greatest tangle of spaghetti I've
ever seen when we pulled it back out and tried to
toss it over the lip, which turned out not to be a
lip at all but merely a shelf leading to a second
lip, which was also not actually a lip but indeed
another shelf leading to another shelf which led
to the drop. After the rope was in a total knot, it
was quite clear that we should have rappelled
with the rope still in the bag, but it was far too
late for that now with the rope tightly twisted
into a self-induced knot on the first shelf below.
I rappelled down and inch by inch threw the rope
onto the second shelf (where it knotted itself
again of course). It took about an hour to finally
get the mess over the side of the actual drop,
where it finally hung free and unwound enough
to deal with. Despite the warm cave temperatures
in New Mexico, everyone began to freeze at the
top of the drop while I sweated below. In order
to keep group spirits high, Sandy set herself on
fire beneath her heat tent, burning a hole
between her breasts through two polypro layers
and a sports bra. I could hear the laughter below,
but figured it was directed at me and continued
fuming at the rope. (She was unwilling to repeat
the show later despite my pleas.)
The drop itself was quite nice after the multiple
shelves, leaving about a 100 foot free rappel to
the floor of a great cavern. Along side you the
entire way was a historic wire ladder used during
the original exploration of the cave. Imagine 300
feet of barb-wire fence type wire wound up
around rotted out sticks of wood, and that is
what the ladder was. Very scary.
We spent about two hours looking around. The
room at the bottom of the drop opened up into
a second, slightly smaller cavern with a ton of
formations. There were some decorations similar
to those we see commonly in the east, but for the
most part they were a lot different. This cave was
totally dry, and all the formations were dusty
with white powder. Your light seemed ten times
brighter than usual because so much of the sur-
roundings were white. Many walls were covered
with formations that looked more like yarn than
rock.
While the first climbers started out, the rest of us
heated up some leftovers from the night before
on a Whisper Lite I'd dragged into the cave.
Worked great and kept the last of us at the bot-
tom of the drop toasty warm without sacrificing
any of our clothing.
Bob, Amanda, and Sandy started hiking back to
the car while Eileen, John, and I derigged every-
thing. All of our lights were failing like crazy due
to dead batteries and blowing out in the freezing
wind. Yes, night had fallen in the desert and the
temperature had fallen significantly as well! The
GPS indicated we were not at the car, and
promptly ran out of batteries. No one had a com-
pass. Fortunately, while we were farting around
looking for rock cairns in the dark, Amanda and
Sandy actually walked back from the car and met
us. Which was a good thing as we actually
returned to the car without having to resort to
Marco-Polo range-finding techniques.
We were hungry and irritable, and still cold by
the time we got back to camp, but all was cured
by roasting the camel over a big neo-VPI quality
campfire and cooking up some instant rice and
beans on the Coleman stoves. We could see every
star in the crystal clear sky, and fell asleep quite
easily before we knew what hit us.
TUESDAY, BY SANDY KNAPP
We had pancakes and sausage for breakfast. We
planned to do Gunsight and Sentinel, since
they're within hiking distance of each other.
We drove back over the Dragon's Teeth, took
the first right, and parked at the end of the road
at the Gunsight camp area. This looked like a
nice campground with Stonehenge-like lounge
chairs around a campfire. We hiked down the
Gunsight ridge for about an hour to get to Gun-
sight. The trail leads straight to the cave; don't let
the step log throw you off.
The entrance to Gunsight is huge. We spent
about an hour poking around, but could've spent
more. We spotted what looked like pottery high
up on a giant boulder, so we went for a closer
look. It was an owl! He glared at us while Eileen
took a few photos, but it was hard to get close to
him. Then he swooped away in annoyance.
