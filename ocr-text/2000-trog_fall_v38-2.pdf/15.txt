Breathing Cave
by Dale Parrott
On July 7, 1967, Bob Vocke of D.C. Grotto, Jim
Dawson, and myself left for Breathing Cave,
located in Bath County, Virginia. After only
thirty minutes on the road, the temperature
gauge on Dawson's Ramblin' Wreck read
"EXPLODE.” Replenishing the radiator's water
supply carried us another five minutes. Finally
we figured out the wire lead to the thermostat
had come off and was touching the engine block!
After spending a couple of hours in Staunton
looking for a store that had something to quench
our thirsts, we headed for the cave. .
Mr. Lockridge, the owner, kindly gave us permis-
sion to enter. On the road going up Chestnut
Ridge to the cave, we hit a bump and to our great
dismay watched the gas gauge needle swing from
full to nearly empty. We expected the ground to
be covered with gas, but not a spilled drop was
to be found. The car was still going so we
watched as the gas needle swung from half full to
full and back to empty again. So what if the car
was running on air?
After our merry adventures in the Rambler, we
turned our attention to the cave. We assembled
some rope for the descent into the second siphon
and entered the cave. We made our way through
without incident to the “Serpentine Way? where
we chimneyed up about 60 feet and crossed over
the passage. Even with the belay provided, it was.
difficult to make that big four foot step across the
chasm.
From there is it a slippery climb up a mud slope
to a crawl that opens into a window. One must
bridge over a fissure passage on the other side of
the window. Even though the fissure drops 120
feet into the first siphon, it was a lot easier than
the traverse at the top of the Serpentine Way.
Finally we rigged a rope into the pit going to the
second siphon. At the bottom of the pit there is
a long, steeply sloping crawl to the stream. We
connected several lengths of handline together to
aid us on the way out. The siphon is at the end of
a long, very wet crawlway. This crawlway
becomes smaller and smaller and has plenty of
jagged rocks on the bottom. And for further
complications, there is a couple of inches of
water in the crawl.
After retreating from the crawl, we paused and
refreshed ourselves with chicken spread and
Vienna sausages. On the way back we checked
out part of the rainwell area. It is a maze of tight
fissure passages and crawlways – hardly the place
to go caving. We also took the Nutcracker route
instead of the usual bypass. Things got rather
tight at that point. Upon seeing a fresh boot heel
in the mud, Vocke exclaimed, “I wonder what
dumb clod left this here!” After making our exit
from the cave, Vocke was a bit surprised to find
one of his boot heels missing!
We had spent about 7.5 hours in Breathing when
we changed our grubby clothes, packed up, and
made our way back to Aqua Campground for
more fun and frolics at the Speleo-go-go.
Way Back is a series of articles pulled from the club archives. Every once in awhile it's nice to be
reminded that this cave club has a long and rich history of cave exploration. The idea and this sub-
mission came from Lawrence Britt, keeper of the club files.
