OTR: Not Just for the Old Anymore
by Michael Cole
Every year cavers from Virginia, West Virginia,
Maryland and Pennsylvania gather together over
Labor Day Weekend to cave, camp, compete,
and party with old and new friends. It has been
an ongoing tradition since 1950. Though many
attendees still cave during the weekend, many are
there just for the party. People are bringing non-
cavers to OTR and changing the whole atmo-
sphere. OTR needs more cavers, especially those
new to caving. There are already plenty of old
farts there; all it needs now is more young cavers,
especially from VPI.
OTR stands for Old Timers Reunion. Since
1978, The Roberson Association (TRA) has
sponsored it. Prior to 1978, several different
organizations were responsible for holding OTR.
Currently OTR is held in Davis, WV, just outside
Elkins, WV. TRA purchased and developed a
piece of land there where Old Timers has been
held for the past several years and will inevitably
be held for years to come. Developments made
to the property include pavilions, shower houses
and the extensive sauna section located along the
river that runs along the backside of the
campground.
So what does one do at OTR you ask? Well there
are several things to do besides drinking and par-
tying. Though not as popular as in previous
years, people go caving. There are several very
interesting caves located near the TRA campsite.
Such caves as Bowden, Sinks, Cass, Stillhouse,
Trout, New Trout, Hamilton, and many more.
One of my favorites is Sharps. The entrance is a
crack in the ground that is about two feet wide
and seven to eight feet deep. Once inside you
climb down a huge breakdown pile into the
stream that runs through the bottom of the cave.
Walking upstream will bring you to a very cool
waterfall that is about twelve feet high.
A cave I always end up at during OTR is The
Sinks of Gandy Creek (Sinks). It is basically a
stream that runs under part of the mountain.
Some portions can get deep, but most doesn't
rise above your knees. The passage is fairly large,
but you are in the water almost throughout the
cave. If entering the cave upstream, a cool way to
exit the cave on the downstream end is through
the "water" exit. I never understood this because
any way out of the cave involves water, but the
"water" exit involves swimming because it is too
deep for most to walk through. Swimming in
coveralls or heavy wool is quite an experience.
And yes, the water is very cold. Though not very
interesting, a through trip may take a slow group
only thirty minutes.
Close to Sinks is a more interesting cave known
as Stillhouse. It involves more mud and a few
tighter passages. Though not very big, there are
a lot of cool little side passages to play around in.
There is probably enough cave to keep a steady
passed group busy for an hour or two. Stillhouse
is located within minutes of Sinks, and a good
recommendation is to go to Stillhouse and get
muddy, then do Sinks to wash it all off.
The Trout Rock Caves are not too far from Old
Timers. These are three cave owned by NSS that
are right on the side of the road on the side of the
mountain. There is Trout Cave, New Trout Cave,
and Hamilton Cave. Hamilton is my favorite. It
is basically a big maze. Though average passage
is only five feet high, the floor is soft clay so
crawling around isn't too bad. Hidden within the
maze of Hamilton is the museum or clay room.
It has many names, actually, but it's basically a
room where people make things out of clay. I
won't give any away, but I'll just say some very
talented people have been to this room, and not
all clay figures are appropriate for young chil-
dren. Trout and New Trout are your basic caves.
They've got some interesting passages, and Trout
is fairly historical in that the Confederate Army
used it for saltpeter mining during the Civil War.
Also, excavations in the caves has resulted in
finding bone deposits of Pleistocene mammals,
including a saber-toothed tiger, jaguar, and giant
cheetah.
All the above caves mentioned are horizontal.
Though getting to any Trout Rock cave during a
snowy winter can be a challenge, especially Trout
Cave. But for those vertical cavers, fear not,
there is vertical to be done near Old Timers.
Though I haven't been to any, I know they exist.
