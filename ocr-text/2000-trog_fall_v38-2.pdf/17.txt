first. “You know," he called up the 30 foot drop,
"I don't think we rigged in the right place.” So
John and Bob re-rigged and the rest of us went
down without a problem.
At the bottom of the drop we saw a cool bat
hanging on the wall. He was a bit too high to
really get a good look at, but we could tell he was
one of those funky-shaped bats with a weird pro-
trusion that we just don't get to see in Virginia.
Too bad he was out of photo range.
Hidden Cave was, for some of us, our first expo-
sure to New Mexico caves. The rooms were filled
with beautiful, white, pristine formations. Every
where you look are soda straws and very fine ten-
drils of helectites. It was also filled with flagging
tape trails, which is perhaps how the formations
stay so nice.

A PILE OF FIREWOOD
EARLIER IN THE DAY.
and went back over the Dragon's Teeth. Luckily
the Suzuki was a filling meal, and we were
allowed to pass without too much of a struggle.
Back at the camp we started the campfire. Bob
had bludgeoned a pile of firewood earlier in the
day so we'd have a nice ready stack. Sandy and
Amanda cooked up some fine spaghetti with sau-
sage links on the side. Despite the cold, we
stayed up late by the campfire eating and discuss-
ing our upcoming trips.
MONDAY, BY STEVE LEPERA
The camel died quite suddenly on the second
day, and LePera fretted sulkily and, buffing his
already impeccable nails – not for the first time
since the journey began - pondered snidely if this
would dissolve into a vignette of minor inconve-
niences like all the other holidays spent with
Sandy
The morning was bright and sunny, but cool.
Our camp water was frozen across the surface.
The campground which had been a muddy
swamp the night before when we went to sleep
now was solid, and until it began to thaw around
10am fooled us into thinking we might be able to
keep all of our gear neat and clean the entire trip.
Despite the obvious advantages, at no time did
we ever manage to leave camp before the ground
thawed.
Someone made breakfast of coffee and oatmeal
on a Coleman stove while the rest of us milled
about summoning motivation to disembowel our
packs from the previous night, sort things out,
and cram it all back in again. For the first time, I
turned on the antique GPS loaned to me by
Philip Balister.
The GPS was confused by its sudden appearance
in New Mexico and protested by staring help-
lessly at the sky for fifteen minutes. Bob got out
his newly purchased GPS and the race was on.
But a freshly awoken, bleary-eyed Bob proved no
match for the antique; while Bob was still stuck
in curious menus titled “MP Load Letter" and
“Moon and Fish Chart,” the antique device pos-
itively confirmed that we were, indeed, in camp.
We wandered around this upper level for awhile,
taking in all the sights. Then Steve made an inter-
esting discovery; there was another entrance hid-
den away and sealed off by a huge metal door.
That was certainly curious.
Eventually we made it back to the rope, where we
hopped on to descend to the lower level. (You
can rappel straight to the bottom if you like.)
This level had more of the same pretty stuff, and
also had the largest section of rimstone dam I've
ever seen. The rimstone dam was almost a foot
high and curved around for about twenty-five
feet. The water had long since disappeared.
After wandering the lower region for awhile, we
decided it was time for some chow. We frogged
and knotted our way out. At the top of the drop,
New Mexico treated us to a clear, star-filled sky.
We hiked back to the truck in groups, changed,
