awhile. Las Cucarachas de la Muerte played until the
wee hours, and kept such cave club characters as
the Scotsman and Charlotte the Harlot in a danc-
ing frenzy. Rumor has it that the band is about to
break up, because Steve LePera wants to launch
his solo career playing the mouth harp.
David Byrne never played so well.

Cucarachas de la Muerte, VPI's attempt to prove we
can do more than just throw wood on a fire.
The cockroach band was so good that they were
invited to play at the following Fall VAR in West
Virginia. This time, though, the band site wasn't
as good and the crowd wasn't as interested. Per-
haps that was okay by Matt Burnett, whose head
was still pounding from the previous night's
entertainment.
OTR/NOTR
VPI walked away from the OTR awards cere-
mony with the Overall Grotto Participation
award again this year. VPI folks took many first,
second, and third place prizes in the vertical con-
tests, again as usual. This crowd is obviously not
drinking enough beer on Friday night. Chris Hib-
shman and Sue Setzler won the individual overall
award for women and men, respectively. TJ and
Naomi Ordnorff showed the other kids how
rope running is really done.
Dave Colatosti celebrated his last Old Timers as
an unmarried man. He was very involved in the
More Wine Party, and ended up puking in a
porta-a-john.
Meanwhile, the original crowd of More Winers
partied at the campsite several miles down the
road. The weather was more forgiving this year,
so the "who can get their vehicle stuck in the
mud‚Äù competition was cancelled.
CONVENTION
This year's convention, held at the OTR site in
West Virginia, was a boon for everyone. Ben
Shwartz and Mike Ficco blew everyone out of the
water with their announcement of Omega Cave,
the location of which is TOP secret.
Carl Bern's photo of Amy Johnson coming
through a crawl won him a blue ribbon in the
Photo Salon, and Ray Sira received Honorable
Mention for the creation of his Why To Cave
map.
In addition to placing in some of the vertical
contests, VPI won the Medley competition. They
just wanted to make sure Carl and Amy know
which is the real grotto.
HALLOWEEN PARTY
This year's party, hosted as usual at the Bat
Ranch, was the biggest it's been in for quite
Among party attendees were Scott the mechan-
ics, a magician, Kurt Cobain (complete with
shotgun), Little Red Riding Hood (pursued by
the wolf), a bat sticker, two Jesi, and some very
scary-looking women. (I didn't know women's
shoes came in that size.)
This year also brought out the pumpkin-carving
talent. Ben Shwartz and his wife Cori provided
their contribution.
Even the pumpkins were dressed well this year.

TRAVELIN' FOOLS
Cheryl Jones joined Bill Stringfellow for a week-
long rail car trip. Apparently the cars are small,
giving the two ample time to get cozy. String kept
