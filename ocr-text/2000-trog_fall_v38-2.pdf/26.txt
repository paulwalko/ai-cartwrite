friend of mine! What about so and so from such
and such? Oh, yes, they used to work at such and
such before he and so and so went to such and
such a place. Turns out they had both been on
the same restoration trip many years before. This
conversation gave quite an insight on the range
and the closeness of the caving community.
After that, it was time to find the main tour
building and do our first â€œcushy cave trip of the
week. We should've enjoyed the easy, effortless
trip, but Steve and I kept looking around the
entrance discussing how much fun it would be to
rappel in. Over there? No, I think you should
come down there....
I'm not going into much detail about Carlsbad
Caverns. Impressive does not do justice. Huge is
an understatement. You must all go there and see
it for yourselves. It makes any cave you've even
been to seem like a mouse hole. Don't even
flinch over shelling out $6.00 (or $12.00 if you're
dating LePera) to take the self-guided tour. It's
worth every penny.
Take the Natural Entrance tour and forgo the
elevator down. The natural entrance path winds
down and around, past more and more interest-
ing things, until you reach The Big Room at
around -850 feet. Go through the Big Room and
the rest of the cave. There are formations of
every type, in every size, and most are sparkling
white. Around each bend is another amazing dis-
play of speleothems.
