Signout has moved to Steve Wells' house. Matt
Burnett and Mark Eisenbees keep their eye on
things now that Kirk Digby has given up his
duties.
Steve doesn't seem to mind having Signout,
mostly because he's never home anymore. He
joined up with Joe Thompson as a travelling bio-
hazard, cleaning nuclear reactors for weeks at a
time.

the SIVTAC listserv readers entertained with
daily reports.
Bob Simonds and Cletus Lee packed their
"funny-looking bikes" and headed for Central
Europe. Why Central Europe? Because they're
crazy, that's why. They totalled 600 miles, got
miles, got
lots of amusing attention on their bikes, and
claimed to have a wonderful time. They also
think American drivers should take lessons from
the Hungarians.
In keeping with the tradition of skipping out on
families during the holidays, a group of mostly
VPI spent Thanksgiving week caving in New
Mexico. Read their journal in this issue.
Another tradition, the SIVTAC winter weekend
abroad, herded cavers to Paris this year. Reports
are just now coming in, so stay tuned....
THEY COME, THEY GO....
Natalie Serbu has moved into a friend's house in
D.C. and has begun some serious job-hunting
while she temps. She seems to be enjoying the
excitement of the big city life. Despite leaving
Jeff at the beach, Nat and Jeff are still an item,
much to the disappointment of many caver men.
Kim Hansen has moved out of Dave Cinsavich's
house and into her own apartment across town.
Perhaps the high schoolers dropping their ciga-
rette butts in the yard became too much. This
leaves Dave free to join his family's cruise as a
swinging single. (Moms, hide your daughters.)
Meanwhile, Kirk Digby has moved his junk into
Pam Mohr's place. They somehow managed to fit
it all, including the two cats.
Amanda Stiles returned to the U.S., but not to
Blacksburg. She's living with the folks in NOVA
looking for either a cool new job or a cool new
grad school.
Kathy Lamb has officially moved to Blacksburg.

Jason Obenshain had to return to NOVA, but
luckily still keeps VPI cayers informed about
every single detail of his daily life through the
club listserv.
After much scientific study and careful observa-
tion, a team of top scientists declare that wil
Orndorff is still The Bastard.
DON'T GET HURT!
In September, many VPI cavers attended an
NCRC Orientation to Cave Rescue. Matt Burnett
helped organize the two-day event which took
place at the Newport Rec Center. The class
learned some basics about the cave rescue hierar-
chy, practiced stokes-handling techniques, and
participated in a practice rescue in Tawney's
carbide \kar-bd\n: a compound of carbon with another element
