After that, we started the twenty minute back-
track to Sentinel. Luckily Bob saw the 150 foot
rope lying on the ground outside of Gunsight at
about the same time that Steve realized that he
had forgotten it. By the time we got to Sentinel it
was getting late, so we decided to forgo the big
drop and left the 350 foot rope at the top of the
ridge. The 100 foot rope was inadvertently left
up there too, although we did plan on using it.

around the hot tea and schnapps. Back at the
camp, we made a big fire, ate some potato soup,
and went to bed around 1:00 am.
WEDNESDAY, BY SANDY KNAPP AND JOHN DEIGHAN
The big plan for the day was to find Pink Dragon
Cave. It was another beautiful day. John chauf-
feured us back over the Dragon's Teeth, past the
Gunsight turnoff, and then right at the fork.
Sandy got the permit from the Forest Service,
but they said Pink Dragon was pretty hard to find
so did not provide directions. Now, I realize that
a single sample can't be used as proof of a gen-
eral rule, but I can state unequivocally that in this
instance, finding the cave was more difficult
without directions that it would have been with
directions. Well, good directions anyway. Sandy
did get some directions from John Lyle, and
there is some disagreement between us about
whether they were "good" or "bad" directions.
We didn't find the cave. I rest my case.
The trail headed due east, down a hill and then
over two major hills. The instructions then said
to go down a draw until it hits a cliff, and then
look for a trail that should take us to Double
Canyon. We reread and re-interpreted the
instructions several times, and ended up on an
outcropping that looked like it could be over-
looking a double canyon. Down to our right was
a massive-looking entrance, and there was sort of
a trail. (That entrance was never found, and may
have just been a shadow.)
John and Steve scouted out another draw that
went down to the canyon floor and found Pink
Panther, Damn, and Pallet Caves. Pink Panther
Panther Damian
and Damn were gated. The rest of the group fol-
lowed John and Steve down a steep, slippery
trail. We looked around some more and decided,
since it was going to be dark in an hour, we
should call it a day and head back. Hiking along
these ridges seemed more sketc hy than anything
else we'd done, and we weren't sure we wanted
to be there after dark. There was some disagree-
ment (i.e. a fight almost broke out about
whether to go back the way we had come
(through probably the only jungle you'll find in
the New Mexico desert) or find a better route
back. We climbed up a little higher and followed
the rock ledge back to Double Canyon and then

At the cave, we backed off the 70 foot rope to a
big rock/chockstone and did a few wraps around
a tree at the top. The drop was about 30 feet. We
used a 30-foot handline to traverse a pretty
room. After the traverse we set another handline
and did a 15 foot arm rappel into the pretty
room. We found the piton that I was told about,
but could not traverse the room like my infor-
mants had claimed. We needed the rope that we
didn't have. If we rig at the piton, we would need
a 50 foot rope. If we rig farther back, which is
what Steve and John recommended, then the 150
foot rope would do it. The instructions I got said
there was another drop of about 100 feet farther
on and then the 250 foot pit. We need better
instruction about this 100 foot drop next time. I
had not read the directions close enough before-
hand, so we probably wouldn't have had enough
rope to get to the 250 foot pit anyway. We heated
up leftover rice and beans and told funny stories
after coming back across the traverse. It was a
mild evening when we got out. We hiked back to
