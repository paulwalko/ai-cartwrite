silly idea, there would be no combinations and
we would just have to move onto the next cave.
Much to my surprise, upon looking at the per-
mits in the car window, there were combinations
to two of our four caves. Elated, I wrote them on
my hand and hurried back to tell everybody at
Cave 32. I called out the combination as soon as
I got within shouting distance, but to my dismay,
as I approached the cave, I realized it wasn't
working. I called up different combinations.
Maybe I had written down the wrong number?
Maybe I had reversed something?
I cursed myself for leaving the permits back at
the cars. When I reached the actual cave
entrance I was presented with Bob and John who
said, “At last, someone with good eyesight can
check the combination!" Never in my entire life
have I been accused of having good eyesight and
I stopped to bask, record the comment, and
asked them to repeat it a few times before
crouching into the entrance to try my luck.
The combination failed despite my eagle sharp
eyes, and I was deflated. I tried the reverse num-
bers as well, I tried look-alike numbers, I even
made up a few combinations. Then Bob men-
tioned to me that with Master Locks you have to
push up before you pull down to open. I tried the
original combination again... and it worked! We
were finally allowed access to Wen cave, our first
cave of the day.
Steve and John rigged the rope for a short rappel
into the cave, and one after the other we rap-
pelled down. It was a comparatively small cave,
but like all the others we visited in New Mexico,
it was filled with amazing pretties. The rest of us
filled out the register while John, having discov-
ered a way up into the ceiling, climbed around
the top making fun of us.
Realizing it was getting late in the day, we spent
only about 45 minutes in the cave before using
our frog systems or knots to climb out. The next
cave on the list was Christmas Tree Cave. We had
fairly good directions to the cave, and we knew
that the first step was to get to the bottom of the
canyon. Where we stood, we could see the trail
we needed winding away. We could either hike
down the canyon the way we came, in the oppo-
site direction from Christmas Tree Cave, or we
could go straight down the sloping side into the
canyon and reach the path that way. Which way
do you think we went?
The hike down was quite steep, and made slightly
nerve racking by one type of cactus. This cactus
could range from the size of your fist to the size
of a small pony, and it looked just like an aloe
plant except it was completely rigid. It was more
like an aloe plant made of stainless steel or better
yet, long sharp pointy teeth. The images of losing
your footing and tumbling into this unforgiving
plant filled my head as we scrambled down the
slope.
Eventually we reached the bottom of the slope
and the area below was wide and flat and covered
with small vegetation. Much of the ground was
rocky and looked like a river flowed through at
times, or at least flash floods.
The trail was well marked with cairns, and as we
hiked the sky slowly deepened into dusk. Our
group spread out, and we hiked alone. We had
seen a dark area on the opposite side of the can-
yon, which we thought might be Helen's Cave,
and Sandy went to check it out. I could see her as
a little blue speck high up the canyon’s side.
It was getting dark as the path bent around an
outcropping in the canyon wall, and I could see
Steve and John's headlamps high up on the slope.
we could see a path, and Eileen, Sandy, Bob, and
I began the hike up after them. It was a steep
path, and we kept losing the trail, but it was easy
to see our destination high up in the distance
where two lights bobbed mockingly. Eventually
we reached a flat area near the cave entrance and
stopped to organize our gear before going all the
way to the cave. There was a small animal hiding
in the rocks near the cave that may have been a
ringtail.
It was a short rappel into the cave, and we walked
around inside. It was a bigger cave than Wen, and
there were lots of places to explore. I found the
"Christmas Tree” to be a bit of a disappoint-
ment. Any formation that you have to squint at
and ask, “Do you think that is the Christmas
Tree?" is not a good namesake for the cave. Per-
haps "Triangular Shaped Rock” would have been
a more appropriate cave name. This was a picture
cave, so and Steve and Eileen set up some inter-
esting cave shots using the camera flash and sev-
eral slave flashes.
