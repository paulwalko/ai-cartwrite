Thanksgiving in New Mexico - A Patchwork Journal
by the trip members
INTRO, BY BOB COHEN
I had the pleasure of caving in New Mexico over
the Thanksgiving week. My friend Sandy Knapp
invited me to join her and friends from the V.P.I.
Grotto. I drove down to Blacksburg, Virginia.
After much traffic and road rage, I arrived at
Sandy's for a very short nap. At 3:00 a.m., Eileen
O'Malley, Steve LePera, Amanda Stiles, and John
Deighan appeared with John's truck. I was
stuffed into Sandy's vehicle with my gear, and the
six of us were off for a 30-hour haul to New
Mexico. I've seen non-cavers go insane at such a
trip. It's a good thing we are cavers.
Our first planned stop was the Wal-Mart in
Carlsbad, New Mexico. Here we took on supplies
and headed up the mountains. A primitive camp-
site near the fire tower was our home for the next
five days. It felt good to sleep in a stationary set-
ting - a tent – although I kept waking up, assum-
ing it was my turn to drive.
The high desert up in the Guadalupe Mountains
is beautiful and so are the caves. Most of them
require a substantial hike to reach. We may have
done more walking than caving, but both activi-
ties are well worth it. Most caves there have a
vertical component, so the hike includes carrying
rope and the usual vertical stuff. I often lagged
behind on the hike (big surprise). When I caught
up to the crew at the cave, the entrance drops
were already rigged. Slow sometimes has
rewards. Being last out of a pit makes up for this
- you have to de-rig and carry the rope.
The caves in New Mexico are awesome. Forma-
tions right out of fairy tales fill huge rooms from
ceiling to floor. All you have to do is follow flag-
ging tape, and you get a grand self-guided tour.
After experiencing only one of these rooms, I
guarantee you will feel near the point of delight-
ful visual overload.
We tried to get in at least two caves a day. Even
with great directions, we still had trouble finding
the caves fast enough to fill our quota, but, hey,
a bad day of caving is better than falling into a
bunch of cactus.
SUNDAY, BY STEVE LEPERA AND EILEEN O'MALLEY
We arrived in the Guadalupe mountains on Sun-
day afternoon. The scenery on the way up was
gorgeous, as was the view from across our camp-
site. We ooohed and aaaahed for a bit and then
set up camp. Out went the gear, up went the
tents, and John cleaned snow out of our firepit.
Okay, time to get to Hidden, the first cave of the
trip. We all crammed into John's truck and
started our four-wheeling adventure. It wasn't
long before we encountered them... the Dragon's
Teeth.
The Dragon's Teeth are about 50 feet of jagged
cobbles on steroids that must be crossed on the
way to every cave we planned to visit while in the
mountains. The Dragon's Teeth. Sounds pretty
terrible when you say it, and Sandy must have
said it 100 times between Blacksburg and New
Mexico. And they grew larger every time, leading
right up to the time when John's tires were up
against them. Looking down at the little things
now, however, they just didn't look so bad.
But The Teeth are insidious in their placement.
If the front right tire went up onto a Tooth, the
left rear one fell into a Cavity. The dragon had
some seriously poor dental hygiene if you know
what I mean. With all six of us and our gear in the
vehicle, tearing the bottom out of the Pathfinder
seemed inevitable. According to John, we sur-
vived due to his skill alone and continued on
towards the gate leading over to Hidden Cave. I
figured, since it was still early in the evening, that
the Dragon had just eaten a Suzuki or something
and was waiting to get us later.
We found the "parking lot,” which is basically a
small bare spot in the woods. Everyone changed
into their cave clothes and arrived in stages at the
cave entrance. The hike to the entrance was a
snow-covered route downhill through the
woods. Luckily there were boot tracks in the
snow for those lagging behind in the quickly fad-
ing daylight.
