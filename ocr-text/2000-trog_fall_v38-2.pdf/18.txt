place to be. We crossed several outcroppings
which may have been the landmark identifying
where to turn off the path and hike down slope
looking for the cave entrance. Because I am
always right and no one else can ever manage to
do anything correctly without my assistance, I
eventually insisted we turn around and look
behind us for the cave, as the topo clearly
showed the cave could not possibly be out in the
direction we were headed.
I was in short order able to save this important
location and name it CAMP. We were about 1422
miles from Balister's house, another important
location stored within the GPS.
This day we were headed to Deep, a cave known
to have an inconvenient entrance skree slope
requiring 100 feet of rope followed by a more
significant drop requiring a 350 foot rope. We all
slowly loaded our gear into John's Pathfinder,
vacuum-packed ourselves in also, and headed
out, again over the damned Dragon's Teeth.
They looked a lot less evil in daylight, but we still
dragged a few times as we crept across. We
crossed these rocks twice a day, every day, for
four days, begging the question, “Why didn't we
camp on the other side?”
After a relatively short ride, we parked on top of
a plateau right at the fenced boundary between
the National Park and the National Forest. To
our left was a breathtaking panorama of ridges
armored like triceratops, limestone spires along
their spine, mesas breaking into valleys, cliffs
dropping deep down into desert chasms. On our
right was a sheer precipice thrusting out above a
wide canyon, and below was a dry river bed lined
with rolled white rocks... from our height the
cobbles looked like a roadbed. Your eyes
followed the canyon out into the abrupt infinity
of the flat desert plains we'd crossed driving into
Carlsbad. Truly worth the price of admission
right there.
So we took some worthless photos, which of
course didn't come out anything at all like what
the camera was pointed at, and returned to the
vehicle and readied ourselves for the hike. Now
sadly without the camel, we were forced to make
John carry the ropes. Plus his own gear, of
course.
Bob and Philip's GPS both verified we were not
in camp anymore, so guided by some treasure-
map quality directions and a crappy topo, we set
off 1-2-3-4 steps this way and 1-2-3-4-5 steps
another way, following some kind of a trail along
the ridgetop. The trail was reasonably clear and
marked frequently with rock cairns, but espe-
cially in very rocky terrain (of which there was
plenty) it could become difficult to find. Despite
this, we wound down a bit and headed out into a
steep-sided drainage which looked like the right
Amanda climbs next to the historic (read: scary) ladder.

To make a long search story short, an hour later
we found the cave just ahead of this point in the
trail. I called this location DEEP on the GPS.
We all kitted up, rigged a short webbing hand line
down to a twig of a tree, where we then rigged a
100 foot rope down the skree slope and into the
entrance of the cave. There is a narrow ledge
along the right-hand wall and a gaping black 300
foot deep hole to the left. We decided to stick to
the right. We all followed the ledge across to a
flat area where everyone sat while we rigged,
which is an adventure in itself.
