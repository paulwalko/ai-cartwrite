BABY BOOM
On April 26, Molly Lucier and Mike Newsome
introduced Birch Lee Ambrose to the club. See
Birch's first trip report in this issue.
Not to be outdone, Patty Kitchin and Mark
Leach announced the arrival of Benjamin Russell
Leach on July 19. Ben weighted in at 8 pounds,
13 ounces, at 21 inches long.
As if two boys weren't enough, Hoss and Laura
Leiffer had Derek Owen Leiffer on September
12. Derek was 8 pounds, 4 ounces, at another 21
inches long. Derek was kind enough to stop by
the Bat Ranch's Halloween party the following
month.
Luckily, there's a girl on the way. Craig Ferguson
and Katherine Shelor held a hasty wedding in
October in preparation for Little Elvis, who's
expected in March.

Carl Bern and Amy Johnson are finally going
legit after years of following each other around

Virginia. Rest assured, however, that the fancy

Dave Colatosti and Patricia Feely have set their
date for June. Rumor has it, Dave wanted to

Natalie Serbu and Jeff Jablonski hosted their
annual Fourth of July weekend bash at their
beach house on Emerald Isle. pure t mommicked
played at a local bar, so the group got a chance to
dance to some cool tunes. Days were saved for
windsurfing, sea kayaking, golfing, eating, and
general lounging about. Fireworks on the beach
are cool as long as you stay out of target range.
VAR AND VAR
Sandy Knapp forced yet another event on the
club, so VPI hosted Spring VAR at a camp-
ground at the river. There were plenty of caving
trips, but unfortunately not enough beer Satur-
day night. Despite this, Sandy achieved her main
goal of the weekend: the campground didn't
flood. The crowd seemed to have a good time
and danced late into the night to the tunes of Las

In true caver fashion, the bride and groom
exchanged vows in record time to get straight to
the partying.
SPEAKING OF WEDDINGS....
Chris Hibshman is days away from marrying his
high school sweetheart, Michelle. Planning was
poor, however, because the club's VP is missing
the first meeting of the new semester. Michelle
claims she doesn't mind all the time he spends
caving; it gives her some quiet time at home.
