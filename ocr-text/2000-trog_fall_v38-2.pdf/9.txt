From all that I've heard, Cass Cave is very inter-
esting. It has some vertical in it. Windy Run Cave
is also vertical and close to Old Timers.
For those not wanting to cave, there are numer-
ous competitions held at the campsite. Rope
climbing, obstacle course, survey course, cable
ladder climbing, carbide lamp assembly, beer (or
non-alcoholic beverage for those under 21)
chugging are some of the many contests held.
VPI has always made a strong showing in almost
all competitions over the past several years, espe-
cially in winning the overall grotto participation
award. Many VPI members win first place in
some contests, usually survey contest and in the
different categories of rope running (mechanical,
knots, and different age groups). And cool prizes
are always awarded at the award ceremony Sun-
day night. Ropes, vertical gear, general caving
gear, camping gear, and other odds and ends are
given out. Some times they give out “OTR
bucks,” which is basically money you can spend
at the vendors.
The vendors are another great reason to go to
Old Timers. Haven't bought that frog system
you've been wanting yet? Well where better to
buy it than from one of the vendors at OTR? The
best of the best in caving equipment are there
and will suite you up with whatever you want and
or can afford. Can't afford gear? Another reason
to come to OTR. Participate in contests to win
that rack you always wanted but couldn't afford.
After a long day of caving, one thing a caver does
best is party. The party at Old Timers tops all
caver parties. For starters, there is plenty of beer
on tap and semi-sober individuals to pour for
you so you don't have to worry about being too
drunk to pour your own beer. There is also
plenty of music. Saturday and Sunday night there
is usually a live band playing on the dance floor.
If not, there is plenty of recorded music to crank
onto the dance floor and throughout the camp-
site. Believe me, it's loud. It can usually be heard
on the opposite side of the campsite. And the
dance floor is a lot of fun. No skill required to
dance with other cavers, because they look just as
stupid as you do dancing in an alcoholic haze. All
this is located in the main pavilion. Just outside
the pavilion is where the infamous fire is located.
OTR is where the phrase "more wood” was
started. The fire at Old Timers is huge, or used
to be before the great fire builders of VPI were
kicked out of Old Timers for supposedly build-
ing the fire too big. Can a caver ever have a big
enough fire? Though the fire is still fairly large,
just remember when you see it, it used to be big-
ger.
OTR parties traditionally last long into the night
into the early morning. You used to wake up the
next morning and go see who didn't make it back
to the campsite and was passed out by the camp-
fire. But this past Old Timers was not as active.
By midnight on Friday and Saturday, the camp-
fire ring was practically empty along with the
dance floor. I don't know what was wrong with
everyone. It wasn't the VPI folks, that's for sure;
we were still up drinking our share of the beer.
Perhaps it was the bad music, or security holding
back the size of the fire, or maybe its just that the
current crowd at Old Timers is too old and not
able to party throughout the night anymore.
So to all you trainees and OTR virgins, Old
Timers 2001 is waiting for you. If you're not a
member of TRA, no problem. There are plenty
of VPI members who can sponsor you into OTR.
With your help we can turn Old Timers back into
the good old event it used to be; caying all day
and partying all night.
