We climbed out of the cave and began to reorga-
nize our stuff for the hike down. We heard a yelp
and a very unhappy Bob joined us with a large
collection of cactus needles sticking out of his
butt and thigh. After the necessary jokes were
made, I used Sandy's leatherman to pull the nee-
dles out, one by one. It was a painful process, and
I don't think that they all came out, attested to by
Bob's intermittent yelps on the hike down, as a
new cactus needle twisted around to stab him.

We reached the bottom of the slope and began
the hike through the valley of the canyon, back
to the car. By then it was dark and getting pretty
late. There was no way we could find the other
caves at night (we had trouble enough in the
broad daylight.) So much for doing four caves in
one day! It took a long time to reach the car, and
the terrain changed back and forth from gravel to
large rocks to a wonderful smooth section of
waist high waving grass. Eventually we reached
the car, repacked, and stuffed ourselves inside.
We drove to look for a campsite, and I drifted off
to sleep. When I awoke, I realized that we had
given up on the particular campsite we had orig-
inally planned on, and were parked in a sandy
area not far off the highway. It was cold out, and
we rushed around to get the tents up and the fire
started as soon as possible. There was little in the
way of firewood, so the plan was to cook dinner
and get into the sleeping bags as quickly as pos-
sible. We warmed up as we ran through our mea-
ger pile of wood we had collected, and we
hurried to put extra gear back in the cars for the
night. It was a strange place to camp. The high-
way was angled so that it looked like the trucks
were headed straight towards us; suddenly they
would reach a bend in the road and drive away.
It was the end of a long day. We headed off to the
tents and fell asleep to the rumbling noise of
Mack trucks barreling down the highway.
Note from Bob:
All through our rambles to and from the caves, a
number of us had to stop and pull spines out of
various parts of our body. Of course it was dark
when we exited the underground. It was quite
easy to fall down the rocky trails even with head-
lights. It was a good thing there were always
plenty of cactus type plants to arrest our fall.
We just finished Christmas Tree, which was our
last cave on our itinerary for this trip. This is the
one to save for the finale with its huge rooms
stuffed with amazing Southwestern formations.
The ropes were packed, and I was the last one to
leave the entrance area. I turned around and
thanked the cave as I do in these moments. The
cave said you're welcome in a way I am yet to
understand. I immediately fell butt first into a
patch of fine hair-like spined cactus.
Before I had time to fret, I had my overalls down
and presented my posterior to our beautiful
young female paramedic. With a flashlight and a
leatherman tool, she did her duty. I was accused
of landing on that cactus on purpose. For the
record, I did not. However, I know my uncon-
scious mind is capable of rolling me uphill
through an entire hillside of spikey plants to gain
the attention of such a beautiful woman.
SATURDAY, BY EILEEN O'MALLEY
After another breakfast of oatmeal and whatever
else needed to be finished off, we did a final vehi-
cle pack and set off for Carlsbad Caverns. Only a
few of us had been there before.
First we wandered around the administrative area
looking for the building where the rangers hang
out, so we could return the signed permits and
say hi to Stan Allison, my contact person. While
searching we met a group of cavers who were
heading into the cavern for some clean-up work,
so we talked to them for a few minutes.
We eventually found Stan, and he and Sandy
chatted for a bit. Names flashed back and forth.
Do you know this person, from so and so who
worked at such and such cave? Of course! Good
