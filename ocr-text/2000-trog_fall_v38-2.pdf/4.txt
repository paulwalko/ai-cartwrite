My Trip to Murder Hole (In Excruciating Detail)
by Kevin Rock
decided to go back the way we came to try a
different route. About halfway back to the
Elevator we started climbing up. At one point
there was a little pinch where you had to squeeze
between the two walls and under a rock. While I
was going through the tight spot, someone found
that the rock above me was loose and I decided
to wiggle through as fast as I could. A little
higher up Steve, found a large rock that was just
waiting to be used as a portable handhold. Once
everyone was up to his level and a rock call was
At the Friday meeting, it was announced that
there would be two vertical trips going out on
Saturday. One was going to Newberry's, led by
Chris Hibshman and Kirk Digby, and the other
was a trip to Newcastle Murder Hole, which was
led by Steve LePera and Chris Rourke. Since it
seemed like most of the new trainees were going
on the trip to Newberry's, I decided to be
"smart" and go on the Murder Hole trip. This
was unfortunate for Chris and Steve because I
was the only one interested in going on their trip.
I'm sure they would have loved to sleep late and
relax on Saturday instead of caving. Luckily for
me, while we were deciding if we really wanted to
go caving, someone else asked to come along.
Tom Calhoun, an old VPI member, was visiting
and wanted to go on a cave trip before returning
home.
Bright and early on Saturday morning, we
gathered at Signout and piled into my car and
headed out to the cave. Once at the cave, LePera
noticed that he didn't have his caving suit and
clothes. This, it seems, was a blessing on our part
for he was thinking of leading the trip into some
muddy passages. Since he had to wear the clothes
he had on, we were spared these sections of the
cave. After talking to Mr. Sizer for a while and

UNDER ME AND HIT THE
GROUND WITH A THUMP.
plan was to go through the climbing section and
then maybe rappel Double Wells. Once over the
straddle pits and into the Meander Room, we
dropped all our vertical gear because we would
be coming out of the hole to the left if everything
went well. Little did we know.
Once everyone was ready we headed off through
the right passage and down the Elevator. This is
a fun climb because it uses mostly friction
between the floor and ceiling. At the bottom we
attempted to work our way in the direction of the
Climbing Section. As it turned out, this was
harder than we thought. After a while of caving
and much backtracking we made it to Slot 43.
From here we weren't sure where to go. Chris
went up to the right and found what looked like
the remnants of a cat, which we lovingly named
Fluffy. After a few minutes of wandering we
made, the rock was rolled out of its position so
that, in the future, no one would have to see just
how strong that hold was. Up and up we climbed.
Then we popped back into the main passage. We
came back up between the Elevator and the
Meander Room. That was definitely not the
climbing section. We decided to go down to the
Climbing Section exit so we would find exactly
where the two passages connect.
Once back to our gear, we started down the
Climbing Section. A little ways down you get to
what is called the Toilet Bowl. I was following
Chris and was told to just slide down.
Unfortunately I didn't notice that the edge was
undercut just a little so when I started my “slide”
I didn't feel anything under me and hit the
ground with a loud thump. It wasn't very far of
a drop but it certainly did hurt. I was a little more
careful after that. Next we went down through
the Rabbit Hole and worked our way down to the
stream passage. About halfway down I looked
below and could see something white. I figured
it was just another animal, for we had seen lots
of bones and skulls on the trip. (Not very
reassuring, I might add.) As I got closer I realized
what this white pile was. It was our beloved
