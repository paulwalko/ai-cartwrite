Editor's Note
by the editor (duh!).
Well it's about time for my every-so-often pitch
for articles. Of course you all know what I'm go-
ing to say, right? But here it is anyway. The Trog
is an easy newsletter; it will print just about any-
thing from anyone. Comics, articles, sketches,
poems, love stories, horror tales, and photos of
your cat in a cave. These are all acceptable con-
tributions.
Note to prospective members:
You are required to submit an article of some
sort to the Trog editor (that's me, remember?) as
part of your membership requirements. In most
cases it's a trip report, but if you feel like getting
creative, knock your socks off. However I must
ask that you discuss your great idea with me first,
just to make sure you're going in the right direc-
tion.
Do not be offended if I send your fabulous mas-
terpiece back and ask for changes. I'm not usual-
ly looking for you to spend outlandish amounts
of time, just that you spruce up the article by
highlighting a few key points. (Do not, I implore
you, go to Andy Yeagle for help in this matter.)
So with that said, please remember your favorite
newsletter (the Trog) the next time something in-
teresting crosses your path in a cave.
