DUMPSTER-DIVING' PROVES HAZARDOUS
(Stolen without permission, thanks to Chuck and Pat Shorten)
In the comic strip Doonesbury it was whimsically called
"dumpster-diving." But a group of Minneapolis doctors, writing
in the New England Journal of Medicine, reports an increased
number of real injuries to homeless people falling into or out of
trash dumpsters.
Dr. Richard T. Zera and several colleagues at the Hennepin
County Medical Center said these three cases occurred in a
three-month period last year:
.- A 31-year-old man suffered a deep cut to his right hand
while trying to pull himself into a dumpster. Although he could
not bend his right index finger, suggesting a cut tendon, he left
the hospital, refusing further treatment.
- A 53-year-old woman scavenging through a dumpster fell
into the street, damaging her right knee. After six months, she
is still recovering from treatment, which included surgery.
- Emergency room doctors found two pieces of glass in the
back of a 36-year-old man who fell backwards into a dumpster.
The glass was removed and he recovered.
One other homeless person was less fortunate, they report.
In St. Paul, a 30-year-old man apparently fell asleep in a
dumpster "and was killed when it was emptied into the back of a
trash truck."
