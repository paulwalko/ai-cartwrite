MODIFICATIONS TO THE SAUVIGNE ROPE WALKER
Probably the most dynamic situation in caving equipment in
recent years has been in single rope techniques and equipment.
The accompanying crude drawings attempt to show some of the
evolution in the Sauvigne Rope Walking System, so popular in the
VPI Cave Club for the past ten years.
The shoulder Gibbs Cam has been replaced by a chest harness
with a roller (Simmons or Landau). The result is a much smoother
climb and a more comfortable position, especially at a lip or
against a wall. The ascender shown in the right hand should be
considered essential for safety as well as comfort. Clipped on
the rope above the roller, it provides a third point of contact
and prevents being upended. It also makes resting more
comfortable and facilitates getting over those bitchy lips; just
unclip it, reach over the lip and clip it back onto the rope,
then disconnect the roller. What a difference.
Probably the most important reason for the safety ascender
was demonstrated during "The Great 1985 International Mexico
Caving Trip." On Christmas day I climbed up the 700 foot drop at
Haya de Guaguas. My ascending rig worked well on the clean but
well used PMI.. Three days later we were at Golandrinas for the
1100 foot drop. About 100 feet off the floor I realized
something was not working. It turned out that the teeth on my
knee cam had accumulated enough wear that they would no longer
grab on brand new, slick PMI. At every step the cam would just
slide back down the rope. If I had not used a safety ascender,
my only point of contact with the rope, and my only working
ascender, would have been the Gibbs on my right foot. As it was
I was faced with a lot harder climb than I had bargained for.
But without the safety ascender? Think about it.
Many chest harness designs are used, the one shown is one of
the simplest. I don't know its designer.
Chest rollers represent a major improvement to the rope
walker, some others are more minor but still worth considering.
Probably the next most useful is replacing the floating knee cam
with a Petzl Jammer. It works as well but is a lot easier to rig
and derig.
The final modifications are quite minor, but some use and
like them. They are (not shown) a shock cord from the foot cam
to the seat 'biner, which might help the cam ride and grab more
reliably, and a l" sling from the floating knee ascender, also to
the seat 'biner. Presumeably the last one is useful for hand
operation if the over-the-shoulder shock cord fails.
Try them, you may like them.
