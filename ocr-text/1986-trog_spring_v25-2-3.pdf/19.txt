CAVING ON COLE MOUNTAIN WEST VIRGINIA
BY
Maureen Handler
Last August I went up to up to the WVACS work week end and
while trying to decide what to do on Saturday, Ph√≠l Lucas told me
about an unexplored pit on top of hill near Anthony Creek. Now
all I have to hear is "virgin pit" and I'll hike anywhere to
check it out. Alex Sproul and I drove to Anthony Creek to look
for the pit on top of Cole Mountain. The directions by the
landowner, Mr. Ramsey, were fairly explicit, so off we went with
the rope and all our gear. Well, we spent five hourscombing the
east side of the mountain, in 90 degree heat, fighting the
stinging nettles without finding any sign of the pit entrance.
Hot and tired, we retreated back to the van for a beer. I swore
I would never ridge in West Virginia in the summer again.
At the WVACS weekend this past February, Bob Amundson, Alex
Sproul and I were sitting at Shoney's getting ready for a bustass
survey trip into McClungs when the subject of sunshine and beer
came up. Well, it didn't take long before we decided not to go
caving. Alex suggested we go back to Cole Mountain. We drank a
few more beers and drove off to Anthony Creek. This time we
started hiking from the north instead of from the east and of
course we carried no gear what so ever. As prescribed by the law
of perversity in looking for caves, within 1 1/2 hours were
looking down the pit. Now we knew that we had to clomb that
damn mountain again to check out what we had found. We made
plans for the three of us to come back again on the first weekend
in May.
On May 3, Alex Sproul, Doug Abernathy and myself once again
attacked Cole Mountain. We had named the cave Saddleback Pit
because we had to hike to a saddle on top of the mountain to get
to the cave. The three of us started hiking up the mountain.
About a third of the way up, I found out that Alex had left the
Suuntos in the van, so with a lot of swearing, I threw off my
gear and went back down to get them. The hike is close to a 40
degree angle for nearly an hour and by the time we got to the
pit, we were already tired. The entrance was still blowing lots
of air. We could feel it 5 feet away. With expectations of a
major system, we rigged a 110 ft. rope and I was the first one
down. We measured the pit at 78.5 feet. It is one of the most
beautiful pits I have seen in West Virginia; a double well with
scalloped walls. Doug rappelled down followed by alex. We
immediately started surveying, only to be dissappointed fifteen
minutes later when we came to the end of the cave. The rest of
the passage consisted of two more short pits and and about 30
feet of passage. The bottom of the last pit contained quite a
number of bones including a deer and what looked like a
groundhog. There was a very small hole at the bottom of this pit
but we couldn't fit into it and there was no more air blowing.
We surveyed what we had found and looked for high leads going off
the main pit, however, we couldn't find any. We were unable to
find out where all the air was coming from. Dissappointed, we
left the cave saying good bye to Saddleback Suckhole. Now I'm
glad that I never have to climb that damn mountain again and next
WVACS it will be back to Mcciungs.
