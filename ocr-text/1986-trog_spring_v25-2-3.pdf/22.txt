... names have been changed to enhance the storyline.
My worst cave experience happened in a local cave while
caving with my best friend, and Rob Hills. My trusted Petzl
Lamp (my best friend) was burning brightly in the passage before
us. We had already descended three pits to place us at the
bottom of this cave we had recently discovered. As we trudged
along in the mud, our boots made a burping sound as the water
created a vacuum around our Vibram soles. Rob followed quitely
behind me carrying only the bare essentials of cave gear, as we
always packed lightly. I too had come rather unprepared to
explore the cave we had uncovered, but we trudged on regardless.
After several hours of walking through tight canyon passage we
noticed burnt embers and footprints at our feet. Had there been
others here before us? Was there another entrance? We had been
in the cave only 36 hours and Rob and I were both still full of
energy, so we continued on in search of another way out. After
another hour of jogging the canyon closed to a mere hallway
passage. In fact, it resembled a hallway in many ways for the
walls were smooth with well defined edges. We continued on with
minor trepidation, for a strange feeling had started to overcome
us. The passage no longer resembled a cave, but rather something
creature made. Our unease grew as the passage continued. The
burned torches we had previously seen now hung from the walls as
if the passage had once been lit. We turned a corner and stopped
dead in our tracks as a towering oak door appeard in front of us.
The door was at least twenty feet high and eight feet wide with
huge wrought iron studs protruding from its surface. There were
no visible hinges or handles to be tampered with. Fearing the
trip back more than what lay on the other side of the door, Rob
and I attempted to open it. The door was smooth and solid to our
touch. Seemingly, as we pushed upon it, there would be no way
- for us to move it. We tried for several minutes to find a secret
lever, but to no avail. I sat down in exhaustion, fearing the
long trek out of the cave. Rob's temper grew until he slammed
the door with his fist and yelled, "Damn, I wish I had a beer!"
Instantaneously the door slid open to reveal blackness beyond.
Rob gasped and stepped back in amazement. We both moved closer.
as if drawn from something beyond the darkness, but our lights
would not penetrate it. I stepped back afraid of the darkness
that my Petzl would not cut, for I had never before experienced
such a technical problem. Rob stared at me blankly, perhaps
wondering what to do. He was a tough caver and didn't back down
lightly from such challenges. Unlike most men, the fear of
perpetual darkness did not deter him, for he was a true caver at
heart. Stepping into the black void he disappeared in front of
me. Fearing the loneliness without his presence, I grabbed our
cave packs and jumped in after him. Suddenly I was cast into an
eternal spin. I could not free myself from -- Aaaarrrrgggghhhh...
I awoke lying in the dry bat guano next to Rob's feet. Rob
looked down upon me as I opened my eyes. "What happened?" I
asked.
"Oh nothing, just another one of those teleports again. I
hate when that happens."
