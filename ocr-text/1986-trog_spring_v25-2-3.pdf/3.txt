FROM THE PREZ:
The club has been doing a lot of caving in the past few
months. Thousands of feet of virgin passage have been mapped and
a successful practice rescue was held in Starnes. Unfortunately
there was a small turnout for the practice rescue. .
I think this small turnout was caused by one of the club's
two major problems. We have a lot of interest in caving, but
very few new members. Hopefully we can recruit a lot of new
members next fall. As our record shows, we don't have trouble
getting them to come to meetings, but finding someone to take
them caving is another story. If everyone takes one trainee on a
real trip it should help solve this problem.
Besides increasing our membership, I'd like to see a new
fence around Pig Hole soon. Seems like this project has been put
off for a long time and the club hasn't done much conservation
work lately. But until the fall; we might as well take it easy,
go climbing and hiking and most of all, have fun caving!
