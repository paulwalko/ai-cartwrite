The Editor's Column:
First of all, I'd like to apologize to all of you who were
dissappointed at not receiving a Trog during Winter Quarter. I
inherited this job about the last week of classes and didn't feel
that there was enough time to put anything out that was worthy of
the name. There are some excellent articles in this issue, and I
hope that will make up for our absence last winter.
Right after I was nominated to be the editor, I moved that
the Cave Club reinstate its former policy of requiring an article
for the Trog as a prerequisite for membership. Somewhat to my
surprise, the motion passed with little opposition. The article
requirement had been a part of the VPI Grotto for years, and was
eliminated in an era of weakening trainee requirements about ten
years ago. At the time, the club was having difficulty recruiting
new people and the membership requirements were slashed in an
effort to keep from turning away new prospects. This may also
have been the time when efforts to strike the word "trainee"
originated. All of the requirements except the Trog article had
been reinstated when I made my motion.
My intent is not to scare prospective members off. On the
contrary, I feel that once a trainee passes all the membership
requirements, including the writing of an article, he or she will
feel that they are more a part of the club. I believe that the
Trog is every bit as essential to the club as officers and
committees and that contributing to the publication should be
among the most painless of all the tasks required of those who
wish to join us.
