TRAINEE TIPS

1). What they always forgot to tell the trainee:
- Go to the bathroom before you get there.
-Don't forget to bring $$$ for a food stop on the way home.
-Watch trip leaders - the comments they make to each other
are often at least as informative as what they tell you.
("Look at that idiot trying to ..")
-Cans of Coke aren't the best drink to take. You have to
haul the cans out.
-Knee pads are very helpful in some caves.
2). Good ideas :
-The pathway down the middle with all the tracks on it isn't
always the way to go.
-When in doubt watch how members do things, fellow trainees
Â· are often just as ingnorant as you so don't follow their
example unless you know how good they are,
- Bats are extremely sensitive. Both light and loud noises
.disturb them so try to not do either. They also don't
like to be leaned upon. Remember, bats are people too.
-Don't shine your light in peoples' eyes.
-Lamps are tempermental. Like them, they're nicer to you
that way.
-Don't jump down anything because you may not be able to get
back up.
-Don't do anything you're not comfortable with..
-Don't complain about wimpy things. Nobody will like you.
- Even if you're scared of bugs, remember they're scared of
you too and they live there.
-Bring a change of clothes. Most people won't let you in
their car if you don't..
-When caving stay as dry as possible, Cold feet are no fun.
-Watch for arrows on the wall. They usually point the way
out.:
-Don't touch fragile of white formations. They break or get
dirty easily.
-Don't ever go solo caving (caving by yourself).
-Don't play around in any unsafe fashion:
: a) Don't throw dirt at people. It could get in their
eyes.
b) Don't ever push people.
