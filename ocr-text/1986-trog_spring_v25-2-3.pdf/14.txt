TWO COMPUTER PROGRAMS FOR CAVE MAPPING
Koichiro Takamizawa
BY
In the process of mapping caves, plotting the map takes as
much time as surveying. Some of the plotting time is spent on
calculating the survey data. In general, this calculation
involves only simple trigonometry, and it can be done quite
easily with a hand calculator. However, it becomes a bit
tiresome after a while. Instead, the calculation can be done on
a micro-computer to reduce some redundant calculations.
. Here are two simple examples on the use of micro-computers
in number crunching the survey data. The first one calculates
two-dimensional projections of survey stations and their scaled
coordinates on the map.. See Listing 1.
: The second program calculates the closure error and its
accuracy. Then it tries to adjust (fudge) data to make closure
on the map. Listing 2.
These are very simple programs, and should be applicable to
to any computers available to you. I am also writing a more
sophisticated program to handle other tasks. If you have any
questions or suggestions to my programs please talk to me.
