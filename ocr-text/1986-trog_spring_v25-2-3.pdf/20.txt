An Overview of the Wilburn Valley Project
Wilburn Valley is located in Giles County on the south side
of Pearis Mountain. There are a dozen or so known entrances. I
first developed an interest in the area in 1982 while helping
Lawrence Britt with the survey of Starne's Cavern.
Lawrence has supposedly completed the survey of Starnes.
However, he has joined the Navy and there is great speculation
that a large Parrott is riding around on his shoulder. At any
rate no one is holding their breath for the map. I'm just
ranting and raving a little on behalf of myself, who wasted 64
hours, and others who wasted more or less. Hey Lawrence...
By the fall of 1984 I was ready to undertake my own project
in the area. On Sept. 29, Craig Ferguson, DeeAnn Peterson and
myself took the first shot from sunlight to darkness in Wilburn
Valley Cave. This was to be the third and final survey of the
cave. Though "attempted" twice before I believed the cave had
not been "pushed" and still held grand possibilities.
Well, I've been steadily ploading along in Wilburn for 2
years now. After ll miserable trips I've netted 5710 feet of
surveyed passage on 1.08 miles. All that remains are a few high
leads which are scheduled to meet the scaling pole in the next
couple months. Everyone can look for a completed map and full
write up at that time.
During the past couple years I've also managed to slip out to
the valley and map two smaller caves with the aid of Joan Johnson
and Frank Gibson. These are Dead Doe and Hodges, both small
insurgent caves. They will also be appearing in publication
soon.
As it stands now there is much to do in Wilburn Valley,
survey and resurvey. So if you are one who likes to push hard
and doesn't mind the inherent sleaze slop squeeze caving
encountered in the valley's caves grab your gear and we'll go
stretch some tape.
