SUGGESTIONS FOR BUILDING BAT HOUSES AND ATTRACTING BATS
· Bat houses of the designs illustrated for models 1 and 2
(see plans) have been used successfully for a variety of bat
species in Europe. Their exact size and shape probably are not
important except for the width of the entry space. This should
not exceed one inch, with the ideal being only 3/4 of an inch.
Regardless of the kind of house built, all inner surfaces of the
of the house must be rough enough to permit the bats to climb on
them with ease, and rough outer surfaces are prefered.
Young bats grow best where daytime temperatures are in the
80-90F range. For this reason maternity colonies are most likely
to use bat houses that provide temperatures in this range or are
So well insulated that body warmth is easily trapped. Europeans
often cover their bat houses on top and for an inch or two down
the sides with two or more pieces of tar paper. The dark covering
absorbs heat from the sun by day and provides added insulation at
night; in addition to protecting the bats from rain.
Several means of insulating or providing a range of
temperatures in bat houses are available but as yet largely
untested. One involves covering the bat houses with styrofoam on
top and on all four sides. An additional covering of dark colored •
shingles or tar paper might prove helpful, especially in northern
areas where the bats may need higher temperatures. Also making
bat house model i two feet tall, with only the upper six inches
and top covered with dark material might provide a better range of
temperature. By moving up and down and from front to back bats
could find roost temperatures more continuously to their liking.
Paint or varnish reportedly is somewhat reppelent to bats, at
least until well cured.
Bat houses should be fastened securely to a tree trunk or
the side of a building roughly 12-15 feet above the ground,
preferably where they will receive morning sun but will be shaded
in the afternoon. Inside temperatures above 90F generally are
intolerable. For this reason a well insulated bat house that
receives only morning sun should prove most suitable. Male bats
do not live with the females while young are being reared, and
these bachelor colonies may be attracted to sheltered, cooler
locations. Additionally, most bats seem to prefer sites that are
relatively protected from the wind.
. . It is important to note that bats can live only where local
food supplies are adequate. For this reason most colonial bats
are found near places such as rivers, lakes, bogs, or marshes
where insect populations are high. The closer bat: houses are to
such places the greater the probability of being used. Those
located more than a half a mile from these habitats have greatly
reduced probability of being occupied unless alternate food
sources are available.
Sometimes bats occupy a bat house within a few weeks.
Often, however, bats require a year or two to find a new house.
Chances of early occupancy probably are increased if houses are
hung before or by early April and also if bats already live in
barns or attics in adjacent areas.
Since use of bat houses is very new in the United States, we
have much to learn about local bat preferences. Your reporting of
successes and failures could contribute measurably to our
knowledge of how to attract bats. Write to Bat Conservation
