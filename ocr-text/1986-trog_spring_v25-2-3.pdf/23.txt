"Yeah, me too," I sat and ruminated over our predicament.
*Well where the hell are we now?"
"Well, we are obviously at the bottom of a local cave. Yes,
I reconize it immediately. It's going to take us a while to get
out though, because we are at the bottom of this pit." Searching
through our cave gear we managed to come up with 30 feet of
webbing, 3 carabiner gates and 2 chocolate bars. Picking up a
solid rock from the floor we headed for the wall. We began our
ascent by using the carabiner gates as bolts and simultaneously
standing on each other's shoulders to drive the next one in. The
work was slow, however, as we had to use the rock as a hammer.
Soon our lights grew dim for we were out of carbide and other
light sources. In the dark we tied ourselves together and
continued our blind bolt climb. Each time Rob pounded in the
third bolt, I would remove the first so that we would have enough
to reach the top. As we drew near to the top of the pit, (judged
by our dropping screeching bats tied to rocks down the pit and
counting the seconds) one of our bolts broke and we were forced
to carry on, both of us hanging from one bolt as we pounded in
the other. The climb was not difficult as compared to the rest
of our journey to escape from the local cave, however. Eating a
diet of cold bat meat and Vibram shoe leather, we managed to
crawl for many days until we reached the entrance of the cave.
Breaking out into the bright January sunlight, we were met with
the cold weather of a Virginia blizzard. Since we had not
planned to be teleported to this cave on our trip, we were forced
to walk for two days back to campus. The only casualties of the
cold were our bare feet, for we had eaten our shoes in the cave.
Rob and I have learned many things in our cave trip experiences,
but none so valuable a lesson as this trip afforded us. From now
on, Rob and I will be sure to pack more than 2 candy bars in our
cave packs, for neither of us like the taste of bat meat.
