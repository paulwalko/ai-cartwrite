Here's what you've been waiting for ..
THE GROTTO GRAPEVINE
by
Kay Jacobsen
The sleepy little town of Blacksburg was rocked last
February by a major disturbance -- the Cave Club held its Annual
Banquet in Squires. Rob Hills, Tom Foster, and Kay Jacobsen were
among the victims. The alunni fought back with leftovers. In
case of future problems, Rob Hills was given a "tight-squeeze
survival kit". Included were such items as vaseline, a shoehorn,
Valium, and a Bible - - everything Rob needs in case he gets
stuck in a cave again or has a not-so-hot date.
To his dismay, Tom Foster gained the title "Most Obnoxious
Trainee". Kay Jacobsen was given a battery powered cucumber for
emergencies such as her boyfriend leaving town.
Many heroes appeared during the banquet, Bob Simonds won
the prestigious A. I. Cartwright Award, and Sue Setzler came off
with Trainee of the Year. Carol Zokaites was given the
Exponential Population Growth Award, but rumor has it that the
Zokaites having perfected the model are shutting down production.
Commerative medals were given to all cayers who have
contributed to international relations and have escaped with
their lives. Maureen Handler, renowned for her international
"relationship" with Alec Villagomez, went to Mexico with Alec,
Alex Sproul, Walt and Cecile Pirie, and Craig Roberts. Mike
Futrell, Ed Devine, and Linda Baker brought American dollars to
Jamaica, Jim Washington apparently went somewhere international,
but we're not sure whether Giles County is on foreign soil, or
whether he went someplace else.
Some other awards: Reggie Reid won the Pig Hole Squeeler
for earning most of his hours in Pig Hole. Garrie Rouse got an
Honorable mention for his brave and dauntless mapping activities.
Josephine Lunny and Kay Jacobsen picked up the VPI Barf Mop for
cleaning above and beyond the call of duty. Becky Himmelmann won
the Armchair Caver Award, and Dave "Fatito" Bennett won the Best
Brewmaster Award.
Brain Bucket and Flame-out Awards were not given this year.
Lack of interest in Flame-out has been blamed on Reagan, Falwell,
and conservatism in general. Luckily, there are some candidates
for next year's Flame-out Award. Craig Roberts is one of the
prime candidates due to puking all over campus. Philip
Ballister, famous Flame-out recipient, is back in the running to
defend his title. He barfed in Mike Futrell's fireplace. Dave
Cinsavich apparently puked in the Ton-80 Club, breaking it in as
a new caver hangout. The Hokie House Committee has been
dissolved.
Sadly, Guano Clusters and Landowner of the Year were not
given. Glen Davis and Don Anderson arranged to have a special
banquet at the Fortune. Restaurant for our favorite landowner - -
Buddy Penley. He was given a certificate signed by everyone in
the club inviting him to every banquet the Cave Club will have.
It was our way of saying "We love you, Buddy!" Glen and Jean
Hartman hosted the Buddy Penley Banquet Party.
