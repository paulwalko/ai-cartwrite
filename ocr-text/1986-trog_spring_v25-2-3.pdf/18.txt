This is a big year for weddings and engagements. Susan
Reece Little married Kevin Edward Murray on April 26th. Her
brother, Lee, is in town working as president of vice for Snyder-
Hunt Corporation. Will miracles never cease?
Steve Conner and Ann Marie Little are getting married August
2nd. Dave Shantz is engaged to Nancy Gibson, and Carol Trexler
and Ray (not Hagwood) have to get married. Kay Jacobsen is
marrying Neil Johnson after she lives in the Mojave Desert for
several weeks next fall. Philip Ballister is pregnant, but Jean
refuses to marry him.
Picnic was the weekend of May 10th. Saturday began with
caving and hacky sack. After the hot-dog dinner, the evening
turned into a more wood party. Everyone slowly recovered on
Sunday. .
And now to catch up on what some of the cayers from outside
Blacksburg are doing:
Lawrence Britt is in San Diego, and is really doing well at
classes. He will have the Starnes map ready at convention.
Eric Anderson is living in San Francisco with a rabbit..
He's working as a street magician. He's going to try and make it
to OTR.
Alec Villagomez is working as a waiter in Austin.''
Dave "so-am-I" Jett is working for Gould Electronics in Glen
Burnie, Maryland. He says, "It's cold out there."
Winfield Wright are living together in Richmond. Win
finished his thesis.
Paul and Berta Kirchman have moved to 2.0. Box 208, Oaks,
Pennsylvania. .
Pam Neiser is getting her masters and Phd at the same time
at the University of Kentucky. Yes, she's still into the
reproductive physiology of sheep.
Sue Lacourse is going off to Georgia with seven guys to an
Air Force base for several weeks next fall. She claims she's
"working". Right, Sue!
Float Trip will be Memorial Day week end. Jim Washington is
admiral, and he'll be holding the party at his house. It will be
the last time anyone will get truly smashed before summer break.
That's all for the grapevine this time. Have a good break
and do plenty of safe caving.
