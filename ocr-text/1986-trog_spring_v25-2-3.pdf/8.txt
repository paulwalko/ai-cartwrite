THE BOND OF TRUST
One of the most important concepts I have learned through
caving is trust. In all of my underground adventures, I have
found it necessary to place complete trust in, not only other
members of the trip, but gear as well. Although to some this may
not be difficult, I found it hard, at first, to place my trust in
people and techniques that were totally foreign to me.
I started caving in mid September of 1984 when I decided to
check out an advertisement for the VPI Cave Club. The meeting
was very interesting, but it was the mention of a training
session which really sparked my interest. I was excited about
learning all kinds of new outdoor activities, especially
something as exciting and thought provoking as the deep black
frontier. Thus, forgetting my fear of heights, I eagerly dashed
off to the bridge session the following Friday. From a distance
the bridge did not look very tall, as I approached, however, my
fear of heights began to grip me. I was going to jump off that
thing? Terrible visions of breaking my neck forced me to grip
the railings tightly as I watched others rappel the 20 feet to
safety. During the session, I was taught all about the strength
of the ropes and the reliability of the gear. These people
certainly seemed to know what they were talking about. Finally
my turn came, and with great effort I rigged myself to the death
line! Listlessly I gave my calls, fearing the positive reply of
the belayer. When I finally stepped over the side, I could not
let go of the railing, nor could I face the ground below me. .
After a few minutes, more out of embarrassment than confidence, I
let go of the railing and faced certain peril. The rope held.
Since that time I have been involved in many caving and above :
ground vertical experiences, and have learned to trust my gear
completely. In fact, I found that the more one knows his/her
equipment, through usage and reading, the more one will trust the
gear which his/her life depends upon. In fact, in order to do:
any vertical work, it is imperative that one believes in the
gear, or the experience will probably not be an enjoyable one. .
Similar trust in cavers was at first hard to give. These
people were strange, and where they took me was even worse. I
soon learned, however, to trust in these knowledgeable people,
for in a cave environment it is not always possible to survive on
one's own skill and knowledge. One must learn to trust in other
members of the party, completely, if the trip is to flow
smoothly. This is especially important for trainees, for
experience is an invaluable aid to caving. Although there are
many examples of why someone should trust others in their caving
party, I feel the most obvious example centers on belaying. When
a situation arises that a belay is required, the situation is in
all probability life threatening. In this instance, it is
imperative for the climber to trust his belayer, or the trip will
soon come to a halt! One such example I can remember was
climbing a lead in clover Hollow. Myself and two friends, one
inexperienced, were attempting to find our way out of the
Andrew's drop without climbing rope. At one point in our journey
I found a thirty foot, rather smooth, chimney climb which
subsequently led to the top of the drop. Although I quickly
