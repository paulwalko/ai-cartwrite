DEAR TROG
VIRGIN WET SPOT
I am a student at a conservative Southern university. While
enrolled, I have been an avid fan of the Tech Trog and an active
caver. I have read of many caving escapades but never thought I
would have one worthy Trog publication. Little did I know of the
delights that I would one day find.
Recently I was assisting a friend who was leading a trainee
trip. We were doing the routine route through a heavily traveled
local cave. I was quickly getting bored while my friend was
aweing the newcomers with his vast knowledge of speleology (such
as: how stalagmites form, and why bats don't have udders).
Feeling like I should be doing more than acting as a
babysitter, I started picking up trash. The long train of cavers
passed me as I was slowing down to pick up the occasional battery
or gum wrapper. After accumulating almost more trash than I
could carry, I noticed a beer can carelessly tossed into a
break down pile.
I removed my pack and squirmed down to it. It was akward
but I soon found out it was worth it. Upon reaching the can I
noticed a slight breeze blowing across my face. I immediately
jumped to attention. Reaching out one arm I found a small
passage. My arm came out dripping with mud. I was getting
excited. The passage looked pretty tight so I removed all of my
clothes in the blink of an eye to avoid becoming stuck. Wearing
nothing but a helmet and a lamp I slowly eased my way in. It was
tighter than I imagined, but the muddy wetness urged me on. The
mud acted as a lubricant making it easier to penetrate the slick
channel. Not very deep in I encountered a small mud block which
I quickly tore through. This allowed me to enter deeper.
All this activity shook up my Premier and my normally 2 inch
flame sprang up to 6 inches. It didn't stop there but increased
to 9 inches. I'd never seen it that long before and didn't know
that length was possible. I redoubled my efforts and plunged
further and faster and faster and further. I wanted to reach the
end before my lamp blew itself out.
Finally the passage exploded into a room. It wasn't a large
room but it was infinitely better than the passage I was in. I
groaned in ecstacy as I spilled into the chamber. Mud oozed off
of me as I collapsed in exhaustion.
I have been there several times but I will never forget the
first time.--Name and address witheld.
