The regular banquet party was held at Turner Beach. Carol
Zokaites decided it was time to give birth while she was dancing.
Russel and Robert Zokaites came into the world on February 16th,
and have been promptly nicknamed Russ-20 and Bo-zo. Not to be
outdone, Pat Shorten is planning to have her baby on Float Trip.
It could be really interesting on the nude raft this year!
Despite all the partying, people are still going caving.
Garrie Rouse has mapped 3 1/2 miles of Stompbottom along with
Joan Johnson, Mike Fiore, Mike Futrell, Jim Washington, and
anyone else he can convince to go with him. The search for new
cave passage is continual. Craig Roberts, Rob Hills, Ko
Takamizawa, and Reggie Reid have plans to explore the siphon at
the bottom of Double Wells in Newcastle Murder Hole, Jim
Washington is looking for new passage in Link's (where else?).
Surprisingly, Ed Devine has given up scaling poles in favor of
bicycling. Perhaps he's getting more intelligent.
Pig Hole has been declared boring, and many new cavers
(alias "trainee scum") have never been to New River except to
float down it. Link's may soon become the favorite place to take
trainees caving due to Jim Washington's status as landowner.
Beer is flowing like never before at the old Link place, and it
looks like Jim may become one of the more frequent party-givers.
John Lohner and Keith Smith aren't happy with their reputation as
party hosts. It has been suggested that a benefit concert be
held for the River Rats to help them recover from their benefit
concert for the South Main Cafe.
Don Anderson traded in the legendary Big Blue and now owns
Big Red. John Lohner has a new white truck. Jerry Redder bought
a house on Patrick Henry Drive in Blacksburg. Jackie Redder's
been seen driving the B. T. She's going to China over the summer
with money earned driving the bus.
We won't have Chicken Wing to kick around much longer. Yes,
Mark Honosky is graduating this spring. Steve Conner and Kay
Jacobsen will be receiving degrees at the end of summer.
There have been quite a few parties and caving-related
activities this spring. Many poeple went to the OTR
tree-planting weekend during the weekend of elections. There
wasn't much mud-slinging at elections. No one wanted to run.
Joan Johnson became the Cave Club's first female president, Craig
Roberts was elected president of vice, Mike Fiore can now abscond
with the club's funds, and Jenny Ford got suckered into being
secretary.
About ten people went up to JMU'S Spring Fling at Aqua
Campground after elections. Rob Hills and Craig Roberts decided
it was much better to sleep on the suspension bridge instead of
in a tent.
Jenny Ford, Ko Takamizawa, and Sue Setzler are the newest
members of the Cave Club. The membership count is up to 294.
Jerry Redder and Glen Davis celebrated their birthdays at
Jerry's place, Glen provided unlimited punch and hot-dogs.
The practice rescue was held at Starnes this year. Philip
played victim in the old Stokes. The biggest criticism was that
Philip's mouth should have been gagged.
Richard Cobb bought a new hang glider. He's teaching Steve
Conner and Bob Simonds the fine art of hang gliding.
