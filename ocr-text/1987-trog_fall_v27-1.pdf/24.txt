This is Mike's fault. It all started when I bounced enthusiastically up to Fiore, and
offered to help him with the Trog since I seem to have an abundance of extra time in
my life right now. He said "Sure!" with that cute little elfish grin of his, and added, "You
can write a Trog article!"
"But Mike," | protested, "I don't go caving!"
"It doesn't matter! Make up something!"
Great. I don't really think my fictional gay vampire story went over too well. I
started having my usual multitude of tedious ideas such as doing a crossword puzzle,
a maze, writing caving trivia etc. The thought of contributing to the Trog gradually
faded away as I got involved with buying guinea pig food and watching / Dream of
Jeannie reruns.
After the cave club meeting one Friday I was unsuspectingly minding everyone
else's business, when Glen Davis came up to me and said, "Why don't you go to Links
tomorrow with Kristen Morris and me?"
Now I've been approached to go caving before this, usually by Ed Fortney. I'm
quite skillful at rejecting these offers of caving, so I knew I could deal with Glen's offer.
Glen wouldn't accept my initial rejection until I'd talked with Kristen. She turned
out to be a gorgeous geology student who had never been caving. It intrigued me to
meet such an attractive female who was not only in the same worthless major in which
I got a B.S., but that she had also somehow wandered into a cave club meeting. I was
amazed that she wasn't surrounded by the usual swarm of males who come over to
check out the new female trainees. Kristen seemed nice enough, and I always liked
Links despite being rescued once from the canyon crack by Bill Kelly on Craig
Ferguson's first caving trip. Glen's not a "cave-until-you-die" caver, and he promised it
would be a nice, easy trip. I decided to go.
Yes. This is a caving story. I hadn't been caving since the week after my wedding
last November. I can't say that I was excited about the idea. I woke up on Saturday
with a feeling of dread. Will I survive Links?? Will I fit into my caving clothes?? I wasn't
sure if I could even find all of my caving clothes! Amazingly, I found all of my clothing
and gear except for a bandanna for hair corral purposes. The clothing went on, but
some of it had shrunk since I had last worn it. I'm convinced the closet at my apartment
has been exuding some strange vapors that shrink clothing because I've had a lot of
trouble with clothes I've had for years suddenly not fitting. Anyhow, I was fully outfitted
except for my excruciatingly tight knee pads and a bandanna. Glen provided me with a
tea towel to use in place of a bandanna.
Glen picked up Kristen and I at our respective homes and drove out to the
Washington residence. Already I realized the distinct advantages of caving with Glen
over caving with someone else. For once I didn't have to walk a mile with 25 pounds of
bulky caving stuff to wait in blizzard conditions for some hung-over cavers at an
unreasonably early hour in the morning. It figures that I finally have a car when my
caving enthusiasm is about zero.
I let Kristen sit up front next to Glen. Glen and I see each other often, and I didn't
want her to feel unloved in the back seat. Aren't I just incredibly considerate!
We pulled in at Jim's place, and I decided I needed to pee. My first real dilemma.
Should I use the inside or the outside facilities? Should I knock on the door and
