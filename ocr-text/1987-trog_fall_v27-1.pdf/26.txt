moved out after only living with me for one quarter.
Back to Links. After the crawlway there's a walking passage with a "hip grabber"
wall pinch right before the room entrance. Kristen marveled at how Glen managed to
easily contort his body to get over the hip grabber without getting wedged between the
ceiling and the walls. Kristen was small enough to squeeze between the walls without
much avoidance of the nasty, hip-high, jutting rock. I managed to get over the rock by
exerting more effort than I had previously in the cave. As I dragged my ankle through, I
had morbid thoughts about what would happen if I broke my leg in the cave. It was
comforting to realize that it would be much worse and probably about as likely for me to
give birth in the cave, and there was absolutely no chance of that happening in a cave!
The little room in which we ended up was almost cozy with its smooth dirt floor and
its little pile of rodent droppings. It reminds me of my living room. We sat down, ate
some of Glen's pepperment patties, and played the turn out the lights bit. We sat in the
dark for quite a while chatting and seeing imaginary walls. I'm usually reluctant to be
the first person to relight my lamp because it's safer in the dark. You can't see the
enormous pit that sneaks up to eat you, but you know it's there. I knew I'd be safe from
hungry pits in Links. There weren't even any slimy cave monsters!
Glen and I broke down and we lit our lamps. Kristen and I began to talk about a
subject familiar to both of us -- geology at Virginia Tech. I won't go into the gory details,
but we both enjoyed some good reminiscing and griping with a sprinkling of gossip. It
turns out that Kristen knows Neil, my closet husband. I wasn't too surprised about it,
because Neil is extremely skilled at meeting female geology students. Besides, I'd
already asked him what he could tell me about Kristen.
Before Glen got bored out of his mind, (But, alas! It's too late for you, the reader!)
the talk turned to horses. Kristen owns two of them, and is good at riding them. Horses
gave way to other topics, and we ended up sitting in that little room in Links for over an
hour. Isn't caving wonderful!
Eventually, we faced the hazards of cave traveling once again. Step by step /
moved toward the hip grabber. I breathed in, and I breathed out! Gathering my
strength, I threw one leg over the rock and dragged the other leg past. Step by step /
reached the crawl. Slithering valiantly, I pulled myself through to where Glen and
Kristen were waiting. We stopped awhile outside the crawl for Glen to change carbide.
My flame waited to get low until Glen had finished recarbiding. Yes. Kristen didn't
need to change her carbide until I was done putting away everything.
Our goal was to get out of the cave and get food. We bravely passed all of the
traditional sport climbs. Then came the dreaded entrance slope with the crotch
grabber speleolump/foothold. I didn't notice Glen go up the rock and out. I assumed
he had no trouble. I wondered how Kristen would do as I thought back to the time
when Becky Himmelmann, Linda Oxenreider and I slid back down the slope a couple
times before getting up it. Kristen put her foot on the speleolump, grabbed onto the
higher handholds and pulled herself up. No problem. I was impressed. I realized later
than anyone who rides horses regularly would have no trouble mounting the entrance
slope. I knew I could get out, but I slid once down the slope just for old times sake.
I survived Links! I didn't even have any major bruises! Of course we had talked
longer than we had moved in Links. There are advantages to sedentary caving; all of
us had loads of energy after coming out of the cave.
Glen took Kristen and lout for Chinese food after the trip. We went out to watch
Kristen feed her horses after our meal, and we saw a gorgeous double rainbow over
Ellett Valley. Thad a completely wonderful day. Caving's not so bad after all.
