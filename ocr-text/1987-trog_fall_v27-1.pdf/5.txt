GROTTO GRAPEVINE
Heh Cavers!! Wanna hear some poop?!?
'cause ya'll are nosey so here it goes:
I knew ya'll would
Here's some OTR stuff. Wonder women Beth and Joanie did some
200 miles of pedal power to OTR this year. Some fun was had by
all as usual! Craig, Dennis Vaders, Berta and Jenny all won for
VPI and got some good awards stuff for their efforts. Pittsburgh
Grotto should give up trying to run Speleolympics. There were
some great looking rain tested roads this year at the OTR site!
Thanks Jerry and Glen! Rain stop the more wine party? No way!!!
Ameoba. Ameoba.
In the beginning (of this quarter) the VPI Cave Club found
itself secretaryless. Our fearless Reggie had defected to
Mexico. Doug Abernathy galently accepted the position for fall
quarter after being threatened to have 40 cavers show up at his
thesis defense if he didn't accept.
Ben's mom hosted the Holloween party this year. With his
costume, Jerry educated us all about safe sex. Mike Fiore's
girlfriend came dressed as a princess...or was it a black
widow...or was it an angel? Maybe Mike should make an
appointment to see Jerry for more information. (Mike will have
to stand in line behind Paul Hess, though. Something about you
can't have your cake and eat it too.) Other people awash in
hormones at the party: Roberta, who was lighting matches off of
men's crotches, and, Kristi, who Joan found necking with Ko in
front of the piano (Ed. note: This is rather surprising, since
Pyro was playing at the time and his playing has been known to
turn most people off.) Barbara left Dave on Halloween to go out
with some hairy woman. Other costumes included a beer can
doubles rig and a happy elephant. Carol Zo was ready and willing
to whip it out for any thirsty Halloween caver. Fergie showed
enthusiasm for his new job with his explosive costume theme.
(Yes folks, he graduated and joined the ranks of old farts at the
arsenal. His club status has changed from young republican to
yuppie old fart.) Cecile provided delicious pumpkin cake and bat
cookies (yum) but it must not have been enough because people
kept taking bites out of Beth as the night went on.
Now for some job stuff. Keith Smith flew south for a while
to build trails. Doug Abernathy will fly south for a longer
while to be a real engineer for Golder Associates in Atlanta.
Chicken Wing got his 382nd job since graduation. He will now be
working for the forest service in WV which is closer to Margaret
at WVU. Fergie got a job. Viola got a job. Doug Bruce dropped
out of school and got a job at Rose's. Kay graduated and got a
job at Arby's. Paul Hess thinks he's got a job as a gigolo.
Heidi and Joanie both chose higher education over work and are
both now gearing up the ol' resumes to find jobs. Ko is
following the Balister school of thought and taking his time to
graduate. Rumor has it that everybody's favorite scapegoat, Don
Oswald, has graduated and is now working on nasty, secretive,
technical stuff for one of the lesser loved federal agencies.
