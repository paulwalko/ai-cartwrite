Giles County Survey
I know a lot of you will not read an article like this for
long because it doesn't have any pictures, however I felt it
would be important to get this in print as soon as possible.
Back a few weeks ago, the VPI Cave Club voted to support the
resurvey of Giles County (VA) cave resources. VPI did this
before, in the 50's and 60's, and the county was declared "done"
before the publication of Caves of Virginia (Douglas). Now, we
are going to do it again. There are a few questions that may pop
into people's mind about this. I hope that I can answer some of
these sufficiently in this article.
1. Why does Giles Co. need to be redone?
The official count of Giles County caves stands at 184 caves.
Among those, 12 are on the Virginia Significant Caves List, and. - 8
are on the Virginia Deep Caves List (>200 ft. deep). EVERYBODY
KNOWS that there are more caves in the county. It seems that
every time someone looks for a new cave in Giles, two are found.
2. Who is organizing this and why?
Mike Futrell and I discussed the Survey with Phil Lucas of
the VSS (Virginia Speleological Survey) at the most recent Fall
VAR. We decided that Link Cave Farm (Rt. 2 Box 554, Newport, VA
24128 ) would be an ideal jumping-off place and data repository
for the project, since it is already in Giles and already gets a
lot of VPI caver traffic. To boot, it and we should be there for
the foreseeable future, and this will give the survey some
stability. I will not discuss our motives for taking on this
frankly monstrous task here, but suffice it to say that in
retrospect, I will probably ascribe it completely to stupidity.
3. What does the club have to do?
We have requested and received official VPI Cave Club
"Sponsorship." This gives us some credibility when talking to
cave owners and allows use of the VPI name in any classified ads
we may have to publish to get leads. In addition, some financial
help may be solicited in the future for map publishing materials,
postage, or other incidentals (maybe; it will have to be voted
on.). MOSTLY, however, the Survey will need PEOPLE! There is no
way that Mike and I can do this alone.
