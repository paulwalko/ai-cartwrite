We hiked uphill forever, fighting our way through dense
patches of thorns and underbrush. John experienced an especially
unpleasant encounter between a thornbush and the hair on his
head. We finally made it to the right area, leaving a large
chunk of hair behind to mark the way back down.
After fifteen minutes of searching, we located the pit. It
was about 10 feet in diameter and dropped down at an angle into
darkness. There was no evidence of surface drainage into the
pit; very little dirt from around the lip had washed in. It
looked like a fairly recent collapse.
We rigged to a large tree nearby and John began the descent.
We could see a bit deeper into the blackness by his light, but
that soon vanished. Because the pit twisted down like a wormhole
or a warped spiral staircase, he was soon out of sight. Moments
later he called up that he had reached the end of the rope, but
the pit continued down. We sent down an additional 30 feet of
webbing, but after joining the two, John again reached the end.
We then realized we had made a mistake by not carrying all of
our gear and clothing up with us. John climbed out and we all
went down to the car to get the rest of our gear. After the
exhausting hike back to thje top of the ridge, we re-rigged the
pit with a 150-foot rope. I rapelled down this time, and reached
the bottom with about 20 feet of rope to spare. The others soon
followed and we found ourselves in a sleazy, muddy dead-end room.
We checked all the leads except a difficult high one, and it
became obvious to us that we were the first cavers ever to be
there. There were no footprints, no trash and no smoked arrows.
We had to dig away untouched clay to examine the more obvious
leads. Although all the leads died out (except that
near-impossible high one), no one had failed to notice the steady
breeze blowing down the pit from the surface. We were just
unable to find where it went. We climbed back out into the
chilly night air and hiked back down the ridge. We were both
elated and frustrated at the same time by that elusive breeze.
One high lead unexamined. And we will be back.
