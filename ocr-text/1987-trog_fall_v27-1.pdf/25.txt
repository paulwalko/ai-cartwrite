possible disturb sleeping (passed out?) people, or should I break in and risk being
discovered and resented the rest of my life? Do you really care? While I muddled in
wishy-washyness, Kristen opened the side door and said, "There's the bathroom." |
made up my mind. Trying to regain some shred of dignity, I sauntered into the
bathroom like I always walk into houses uninvited to sit on the toilet. At least, I
rationalized, I haven't totally grossed out Kristen and scared away another female
trainee by picking the nearest bush to pee behind.
Jim came out while we were changing, and we exchanged comments about the
weather and caving etc.
As I checked my pack for the last time, Glen taught Kristen how to light a lamp.
She lit it well. I had trouble with my striker being stiff as usual. Glen had me loosen the
spring a bit which didn't feel much different, but I did get the lamp lit along with
mutterings of "I hate this lamp! I've always hated this lamp! I liked my old lamp better!"
I was trying really hard to be enthusiastic about caving, but it's fun to gripe a little.
We trudged up the hill, and I went from being first in line to being last. I was
impressed that I walked up the hill fairly easily, and could still breathe when I got to the
top!
It took us a little while to find the cave entrance because the Links entrance always
moves farther away when it knows that someone is approaching. Kristen saw the
cave before the rest of us.
Glen crawled in first. I took the rear and warned Kristen about the little slope near
the entrance with the crotch grabber speleolump in the middle of it. She had no
trouble. I was crawling along clutzily with my helmet creeping forward. My lamp rested
on my nose. I stopped to readjust everything while Kristen identified fossils for Glen.
Of course I'd never noticed trilobite fossils in Links before. I felt I had to add my two
cents so I said, "Gee! I've never seen trilobite fossils in Links. Those are neat looking!"
Trying to appear somewhat intelligent, I added, "Yes, that one is definately a trilobite
fragment, but I'm not certain about that other fossil." My wisdom fell on deaf ears
because I was crouching uncomfortably behind Kristen out of the range of the excited
fossil hunters. Just when I was starting to feel third wheelish, our leerless feeder
guided us into the depths of Links, or at least out of the sun light.
It was a nice, slow, laid-back trip. I slipped and slid behind Kristen, but I managed
not to fall on my derriere. (This is a family article, in case you haven't noticed.) Glen
was a good tour guide and pointed out the flowstone etc. Kristen and he discussed the
formation of speleothems with occasional outbursts from me. Meanwhile, my lamp
decided to rest on my nose again. I started to fall way behind the others. Luckily, Glen
stopped in the room past the "200 foot pit" to point out more cave curios. I decided the
tea towel had to be removed from my head whether my hair frizzed up into my lamp
flame or not.
Glen's destination was to get back into the rat feces room which meant we had to
crawl through the short, worm tunnel passage. Both Glen and I could have sworn there
was a small climb before the crawlway, but the cave must have changed around since
we had last been there.
The worm crawl was found, and soon I was pushing my pack in front of my head,
as / slithered on my side. Kristen seemed to be enjoying the crawl. Of course she
didn't have a pack. My first roommate only went caving once because she volunteered
to carry a pack in New River Cave, on top of twisting her ankle in the cave. I don't think
she appreciated Keith Smith spitting on carbide in an enclosed vehicle either.
Tragically, poor Alice was not cut out either to be a caver or to live with one. She
