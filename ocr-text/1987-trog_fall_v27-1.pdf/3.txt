Oy! It'll surprise ya! Well, thus ends another interesting
and fun filled quarter with the VPI Cave Club. The fall was
filled with lots of great sport trips, survey trips, and trips to
other lands far, far away (and caving trips too...). For
example, VPI started out the fall with an excellent turnout at
yet another record breaking crowd at OTR! We partied with pride,
stayed up until sunrise, taunted the fat fucker, had too much fun
at the more wine party, and walked away with more than our share
of prizes. VPI was also present at the fall TAG and local VAR
events as well.
As the fall quarter opened up, the OTR "party 'till you puke"
attitude continued with several keg parties which couldn't be
beat. These parties were well attended by new cavers, as well as
old, as a new crowd of prospective members joined us for party
antics and caving adventure alike. Fortunately the early year
throng of anxious cavers has not died out, which holds out high
hopes of several great new members in the near future. The club
showed new found enthusiasm for the practice rescue as well,
boasting a throng of interested trainees and veteran rescuers
alike.
I hold out high hopes for this winter quarter as well!
With any luck our keg parties will continue, as well as some cool
caving trips, etc. So far there are trip plans for VPI to invade
Mexico once again. With any luck this years trip will be blessed
with good weather and as good a time as all the previous trips.
There should be plenty of great trips ahead now that all the
newest members have been thoroughly oriented into the club.
Surveying and ridgewalking should be high on everyone's list now
as the weather turns cold, and there's nowhere else to go besides
caving or Ton-80. Also, keep January 16-17 open on your
calendars. That weekend will be the first of two special rescue
seminars hosted by the club and taught by the eastern region
NCRC. This seminar should be beneficial to all VPI cavers, and
local rescue squads as well. This mostly horizontal weekend
seminar will be followed by a vertical rescue seminar of some
technicality in May. Stay tuned for details. Also mark your
calendar for banquet dinner in the glamourous Owens D-room dining
facilities on February 6th.
Dudes! Go Cave!
