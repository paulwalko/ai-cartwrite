attracted a layer of sand from the crawls coming up.
Also on this trip we went through the Petrified Wood Passage
which, strangely enough, has petrified wood sticking out of the
wall. It was one of the neater things I've seen on a cave trip.
That was the last trip of the semester for me. Not too much
later I was back in Blacksburg, and back into Newberry's
surveying. I had spent almost 160 hours caving this year and my
grades showed it. I eventually retired to make up for this year,
but I still go caving when I want to, or I get paid. In the next
couple years I was involved in exploring new caves in new
sinkhole collapses, not to mention slicing up my hand. I'd tell
you more, but I think a whole year is good for now.

Through the Eye of the Cat
Through the eye of the cat... Down, down, ... it's a long way
down. Over the lip it's different, feel the energy. Total body
weight - total body life suspended. Look down, no bottom, just
two spots of flame in the darkness. Look up, the jealous light
tries in vain to follow you down, but weaker than the darkness,
it can never reach any further. From the bottom, the darkness
laughs. He knows who always wins.
At the bottom you feel different - more alive somehow. The
walls around seem to breathe with you and into you. All around
are passageways, crawlways, and climbs. As each is seen the
energy mounts. Which way? Anyway, everyway! The loneliest
passage seems to draw you the most. Peer in with the flame.
Rocky, muddy, yucky crawlway that seems to narrow into
nothingness. No wonder it's so lonely. Try another way. Up and
over is the goal this time. Climb up half way, then sit back and
survey the best route. What's this? Ok, so now sit and wait for
your elders to show you how it's done. Follow behind. Move
quietly through the cave. Softly and quietly pass over the hard
rocks. If you do not fight them, they will not fight you. But
isn't that always how it is? Within the compromise, even the
tightest crawl is passable.
Come to a pit. No rope? No gear? Then, stay away from the
edge. Here is where the energy is strongest. Feel the power.
What is the source?!? The bottom screams up like a siren.
Taunting you, seducing you. Continue past or be caught.
Almost out, up out. The sun is still shinning. The energy
of the darkness is just barely detectable. Look back at the
opening. The darkness seems to be seeping out around the edges,
just waiting for the night to fall.
