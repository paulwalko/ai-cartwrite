So you want to go to Kentucky, Eh?
In August 1982 I found myself sitting in a small room on the
12th floor of a 26 story brick phallus which masquerades as a
dorm. There I was, more than four hundred miles from home in
some town called Bowling Green, the home of Western Kentucky
University (WKU, pronounced "Wuck-you"). There was no question
why I was there, I was sitting in the middle of the most famous
karst area in the world.
8/28 The weekend after I had arrived I went into Roppel. It
took me a whole night, but I was able to convince someone to pick
me up and drive me to the cave. So Friday night Tom Brucker and
Jim Borden walked into the lobby of the dorm where I had been
sitting long enough to tell at least five people: "No, I'm not a
coal miner."
In the morning we made the drive into Cave City for breakfast
and then drove through most of Hart country in search of carbide.
Once Tom had bought some carbide, we went caving. I went with Jim
Borden and Bill Walter to Freedom Trail, and the well named
"Chocolate Pudding Passage." Pete Crecelius took Tom Brucker and
Tom Gracinon to the Lunatic Fringe. Our leads were disgusting
and didn't go anywhere, so we did not get much mapped. The trip
was also plagued with bad compass readings, lamp problems, and
was just a bitch in general.
We left after getting fed up with all the problems with only
a couple hundred feet of survey. After stumbling out of the now
ridiculously easy Weller Entrance, we slept until Pete and the
Toms came in. They had gotten enough footage to make the cave 40
miles long, ending the weekend on a good note.

9/4 The next weekend I was at OTR, and when I wasn't glass
wrestling with Dave, Philip and I went into Bowden on our annual
nerd trip. As we ran through the cave in tennis shoes and
shorts, we enjoyed the sensations of the cold water rushing over
our legs, and the stares of the masses of properly clothed cavers
we ran past.
9/11-9/12 The weekend after, back in KY, I went out and checked
some small caves with Geary Schindel (former D.C. Grotto type),
and Russ Miller (the Green River Grotto pres.). None went
anywhere, but one had an interesting feature: a significant lack
of air! The cave was later found to have an de content of about
13%, which is hovering close to the deadly 9% figure. Fortunately
for us carbide lights don't burn well when the air only had 13%
Oe, or we would have been a dead bunch of fools.
The next day however I was quite alive, and was crawling
through Mammoth Cave in search of some abandoned wetsuits for
Jim Quinlan. We went in the Fergusson entrance, which is under
the "control" of a local caver. What I saw was a really nice
cave, but it was kind of ruined by the fact that on the way out I
was carrying a wetsuit in a pack through the S-survey-like (a
place in Roppel) "J-survey." All I have to say about the
J-survey is that it is a bitch and a half with a wetsuit, and I
suggest you never try it with one.
