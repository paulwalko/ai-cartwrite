9/18 The next weekend I was in Tennessee running through The
Mountain's Eye System after Darlene Anthony, another woman,
Rodger Ling (who did Mount Thor), and John Hoffelt (who had
invited me along). I was the first non-Tennessean to do the
through trip in this recently connected neighbor of Xanadu and
the rest of those heavenly places. I must say I was all of the
"gaping Virginian" John said I was. The cave was full of huge
trunks and huge rooms. I was definitely in awe: I stumbled
after them with my mouth open, scanning the walls and the ceiling
with my straining eyes. After that, the surface seemed small.
10/9 Following that, I just couldn't go caving in Kentucky, so I
laid off for a couple weeks (mainly because I had no one to go
with). But eventually I just had to go caving, so I went with
Sue Schindel into Lost River. The cave smelled like it was full
of some sort of petroleum product, and was known to connect with
the septic tanks of some housing developments. We waded all the
way to where the water disappears under a wall, and started
climbing over the breakdown. As I crossed one block, I looked
down and noticed a rather disgusting pool which I knew I didn't
want to fall into. Seeing that, we left wondering what toxins we
were exposing ourselves to. When we got out I noticed a cut on
my leg already surrounded by the red sign of infection. I spent
the weekend cleaning it out, and pledging never to return.
10/27 Two weeks later I was in Lost River again, collecting
water and scunge samples for the state. These were refused by
the lab, because the bottles which were given to us did not meet
their new standards. I wouldn't go on the second collection.
10/30 Then, days after the Lost River sample collection took
place, I got a call from Pete Crecelius. He wanted to go into
Roppel to try and connect a major loop in the cave. I jumped at
the opportunity, and on Saturday morning was chasing him through
Kangaroo Trail-hopping across the canyon in the floor. Then
after wading through the Brucker Connection, we popped into
Elysian Way and ran up the upstream trunk, where I'd never been.
We eventually came to the entrance of Transgressions Trail, where
after all that trunk passage we had to follow the T.T.; which, as
its name might suggest, is not fun. After one-hundred and sixty
stations of crawling, canyoning, and general contorting through
some of the tighest cave I've seen outside of Paul Penley's, we
came to the last station!
Pete and I explored the few leads in the area: he took off
down a crawl with pools in the floor, and I explored the most
promising lead, which had been explored by Bill Walter to a dome.
I got into the dome and looked for a hole down (since we had been
told that Canadian Mist Dome was below by the computer and Jim
Borden). After finding none I was greatly discouraged, and it
took Pete ten minutes to talk me into going back into the tight
canyon to survey to the dome. When we finally got there, Pete
looked around and as I was commenting on how much the dome looked
like CMD, he let out a yell. It turned out that we were
underneath Canadian Mist Dome, rather than above it; it also
