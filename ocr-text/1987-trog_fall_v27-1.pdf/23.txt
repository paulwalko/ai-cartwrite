Then we visited a very interesting room called the library
that had some stuff even better than the flowers. I was told
that a guy named A. I. Cartwright lived at the library. He
wasn't home, though.
Then it was time to head back. It was getting late and it
was going to take a long time to get out with three of us
using prussik knots. We got to the rope and two of the members
cigged up their rope walkers and zipped up. Then the two
other trainees tied their knots and inched up the rope. I
thought that it didn't look hard and it wasn't hard at the
bridge. Then I tied my knots and started up. Being a smoker,
my endurance is pretty shoddy. Boy, did I feel it there. But
I kept on going. I had a slight fear not of heights, but of
my vulnerable position, putting my life on the line, liter-
ally. I pretty much overcame that fear on that first climb.
We made it up the 2 minor drops and headed to the
entrance drop. Again two of the members rope walked to the
top and the two other trainees slowly but surely climbed up.
Then it was my turn again. I was still pretty exhausted from
the first climb. I started to climb and felt my strength
slowly draining. I got 2/3 of the way up when I couldn't go
any further. The guys at the top encouraged me and I started
up again. I got about 10 feet from the top when I heard my
name called. I looked up and all I saw were 2. arms opening up
an ice cold Stron's. He said that it was mine when I got to
the top. That was all the encouragement I needed. I made it
to the top and got the cowards of both the beer and the sense
of accomplishment. I had done it. I was out of the cave and
felt almost dead yet exhilarated. It was like nothing I'd
ever done and something that I plan to do many many more
times. I learned three major things that day. One was never
to give up on yourself. Two, a cold beer is so incredible
after something like that, and three, mechanical ascenders
are so much better than those damn knots! ! !
