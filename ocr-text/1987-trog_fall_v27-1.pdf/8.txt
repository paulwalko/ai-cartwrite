4. How is this going to be organized?
I'm glad you asked that. We don't know yet. But there are a
few rules that we are going to try to follow to keep things from
getting out-of-hand:
A. An open-door and open-mind policy. Anybody that wants to
help can help. We will discourage "secret caves" unless it is
the owner's expressed wish that a cave be unknown.
B. There is no such thing as too much information about a
cave or area. However, we would like to direct some activities
to the lesser-known caves and areas in the county. An organized
task eventually gets finished. There has to be some organization
or the survey will never be completed.
C. Despite A and B, this should be FUN. Caving more and
enjoying it less is not in any way an objective of the Survey.
5. What is this going to entail?
A. Lots of Ridgewalking
B. Lots of Cave exploring
c. Lots of Cave Surveying
D. Drawing lots of maps
OK, lots of Partying (I know you guys)

7. What's in it for me,
?
-
(put your name here)
It's hard to guarantee anything but beautiful scenery in
Giles. Caves can range in size anywhere between "virgin passage
up to my elbow" and 3 (maybe more) miles. There are wet, dry,
pretty, nasty, vertical and horizontal caves. How much you enjoy
Giles is limited only by your imagination!
Take a walk in rustic splendor
See wild Nature going by
Looking high and low the valleys
Search between the earth and sky
Hear it said, it's oft repeated
In fields, doorways, churches' aisles
There's a cave in yonder hill
That goes for miles and miles in Giles.
