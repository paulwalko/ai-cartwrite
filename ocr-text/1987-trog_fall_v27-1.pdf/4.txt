The Editor's Column
As I numbly scan the debris of another vicious Trog editing
session, wondering whether White-Out fumes kill brain cells or
merely temporarily deaden them, I suddenly realize that I must be
one of the stupider people on this planet. Not only did I accept
this job, I volunteered for it. All my badgering, begging, and
threatening must have worked, though; the number of articles
submitted far exceeded my expectations. Thank you to everyone
who submitted something, or just submitted.
I'm impressed by the variety of articles, from Ben Keller's
opus on Kentucky caving to Kat's interesting perspective on
trainee trips--I guess psychedelics are indeed enjoying a
resurgence. Mike Futrell, after much ado, supplied some cave
maps, which is something I feel should be in every Trog. Maybe
Jim's Giles County project will help meet this noble goal
Thanks also to Jenny, Joan, and Joe for their spy work. Kay
gets special kudos for her stunning mastery of pretty word
processing. She saved Beth and I a lot of work, even though her
article puts the appearance of the rest of the Trog to shame.
Trainees, submit trip reports for your Trog requirements. They
are pretty easy to write, and help keep the focus of the Trog on
what the club is famous for--tripping hard.
