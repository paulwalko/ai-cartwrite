From the Signout Sheet:
As usual, the Cave Club cayed hard (or at least a lot) this past quar-
ter. Thirty eight trips signed out from the new location at Cecile's house.
Thanks to the usual cast of thousands type trainee trips, we racked up a
respectable 1035.5 man-hours underground. Some of the highlights:
