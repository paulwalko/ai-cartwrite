This is a small insurgence cave developed in Wilburn Valley
on the southeastern flank of Pearis Mountain. A year round
stream flows off the mountain and down nearly to the road where
it takes a turn into an obvious sink.
The cave was surveyed by Mike Futrell and Joan Johnson in two
short trips ending May 31, 1986.
The entrance room is nice and if you were a bum to excess you
could probably live in there. Local rumor has it one did ages
ago. Following the stream the passage rapidly deteriorates to a
set of domes and three crawls. I climbed the largest dome and
determined that it didn't go. This was mentally stimulating as
the walls were mud slime over rock and the only holds were
frequently portable chert nodules. The stream heads down a small
bellycrawl, "The Cobbler" for 50'. It's nasty and you probably
don't want to go there. The right lower crawl goes 90' to a
stagnant pool with organic floating debris. Climbing up 10' at
the junction is another crawl of 50 or so feet that ends in
brittle rock and slime.
Coming back down this last climb the mere mention of Don
Oswald's name caused Joans lamp to fall and smash apart below.
The cave also bit our survey tape in two when we weren't looking.
Complain, complain. All in all Hodge's is a typical Wilburn
Valley cave - an overabundance of nasties. It is 460' long and
43' deep.

Wolf Creek Pit
On October 1, John Dowell, Rodney Smith and I decided to
check out a rumor of a pit on East River Mountain near Narrows.
After wasting a lot of time in town gathering people and gear, we
proceded to meet a local friend of Rodney's named Eddie who had
actually seen the pit during a hunting trip two years ago.
We met Eddie at the appointed place and time and, after
telling our location and return time to a reliable person,
started the long kike up to the ridge. I had chased down a lot
of disappointing leads in the past, so I felt little hope of
finding anything significant. With that in mind, we left our
caving clothes and most of our gear in the car. We carried only
a 50-foot length of rope, two sets of vertical gear, and one
lamp and helmet. We figured we would just have to send one
person down into the pit to verify that it was nothing.
