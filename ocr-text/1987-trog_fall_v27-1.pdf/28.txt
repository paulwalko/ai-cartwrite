RAWHIDE
(Caver Version)
My fellow cavers, when I was back there in Northern New Juhsey, after
having a Thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat, I came to the sudden
realization that there had not been a song about cavin' written in a long
time. With tears in my eyes, I pulled out a pen, sat down, and thinking
about the snickering of the members that had occurred during one of the
Great Trainee Drives of '87, I wrote down the following song.
Em
Em
D
Em
B
Rollin; rollin', rollin', tho' there slowly strollin'
keep them trainees rollin' , Rawhide!
Em
Thru mud and slime and breakdown, just give these guys a shakedown,
B? Em
wishin' they'd kept their carbide dry. All the time you're wishin'
D
Em
they'd just shut up and listen, and give the Thistle Tube a try.
Em
Chorus: Get em in, get em out, get em out, get em in, get em in,
get em out, Rawhide!
Em
Tie em in, get em up, tie em off, tie em in, get em down,
B
Em
tie em off, Raw-hiiide!!
Movin', movin', movin', tho' there dis-approvin',
keep them trainees movin', Rawhide!
Em
D
Em
Don't try to understand 'em, just tie em on and land 'em,
| B7 Em
wishin' you had a beer by your side. Your head is calculatin',
Em
D
its in the car and waitin', waitin' for when you get outside.

Chorus.
