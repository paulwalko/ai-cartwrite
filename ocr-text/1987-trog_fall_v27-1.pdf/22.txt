My First Vertical Trip
U
20
Caving was not a new thing to me. I've caved since I was
11 years old growing up outside of Albany, New York. I came
to Virginia Tech wanting to continue my adventures in some
new caves. That wish was granted when I discovered tho UFI
Cave Club. I thought that it was just an informal bunch of
people that did what I used to do. Boy! ---was I wrong. I
found out that they did vertical caves where I had only been
horizontal caving.
I was told to go to "the bridge” to learn and practice
vertical techniques. I thought "Oh Wow!”, something I'd never
done before and would quench my thirst for adventure. I went
to the bridge and was taught various ways to rappel. I still
wasn't ready to do a vertical cave. I knew how to go down a
rope but not how to go up a rope (That might be usefull! Then
came the day that I learned how to prussik, I thought that I
was ready to do a vertical trip.
Then, that night at the meeting, I was asked if I wanted
to do a cave called "Clover Hollow." I jumped at the chance.
The next day I was all psyched to do my first vertical
trip. We drove out to the cave and changed into our play-
clothes. We got to the entrance pit, and while the rope was
being rigged, I tried to look into the pit, Blackness. My
heart started to pound. I tied my webbing seat while I
watched the two other trainees rig up and rappel in. Then it
was my turn. For a second, I had second thoughts. They were
quickly overridden by the thought, "C'mon you puss, you only
live once!" At that, I rigged up and started to drop in. It
was so much better than the bridge!! The 70 odd foot drop in
was incredible! I wanted to jump up and do it again! My eyes
adjusted to the bit of sunlight coming in from the entrance
as we charged up our lamps. We walked down the long hallway
of breakdown and made our way through a crawlway. Then came a
short drop down a flowstone slide where we did an arm rappel.
Then came the cable ladder drop. We came to a spot that is
called the Grand Canyon. I retied my seat so tighten it while
the second rappel was being rigged. I was told that if I
liked the entrance drop, then I would cream my jeans over the
second. Again I watched as the two other trainees rigged up
and dropped. Then I chimneyed out to the rope, rigged up and
began. The difference here, was that it was a much longer
drop, and there was no sunlight to see by. All I could see
were my immediate surroundings and 3 tiny dots of light at
the bottom. I didn't want this to end. I was having the time
of my life! I finally got to the bottom.
We proceeded to bop around and got to a little place
where there was a small hole at the floor just big enough to
fit through. They told me that it was called the thistle tube
and that there were the most beautiful gypsum flowers at the
bottom. What the hell? I like cave pretties so wormed my way
to the bottom. Those flowers were the most beautiful ones I'd
seen in a long time. I finally managed to worm my way out.
