3/20 This weekend I spent most of my time working on my
research paper, but Sunday night I put on my brand new wetsuit
and went caving. Although it had been raining all day, the water
in State Trooper Cave was low, according to Geary and Sue.
State Trooper is upstream of Lost River and carries part of
the water. It turned out that most of the nasty chemicals were
passing through this cave. But we figured we were safe since we
didn't know these facts at the time.
Despite the contents of the water, my wet suit didn't melt,
but the first thing I heard when I started swimming was "Don't
drink the water!" They had forced me to wear gloves so I
wouldn't die of infection after cutting my hands (The Lost River
Chert likes to cut, as I found out later when I fell a couple
feet in another cave). Of course, later Geary grabbed and pulled
me down while I was taking a breath. I spat for the next five
minutes because the water tasted like shit.
Except for a few nauseating minutes, the trip was really fun.
It certainly made forking out eighty bucks for a wet suit feel
better. Also it provided a good break from studying toxic
wastes, and gave you more to read about.
About a week later I tagged along with George and Geary, as
they were setting up a dye trace for Dr. Crawford; setting the
bugs in various places, including State Trooper. We went to dump
the dye in a pond south of town. The pond had a familiar odor of
nasty chemicals, not the same as in Bertha but close. Geary and
I dumped the dye into a swallet at the downstream end, however we
did not enjoy making sure all of the dry powder got into the
water and turned it brilliant green.
Later in the week the Feds were stomping around the pond
taking samples. One thought he burned his hand when he stuck it
in the water to collect a sample. Then after an analysis they
found the water contained most of the chemicals which had been
found in Lost River. The fact that the dye trace came through at
State Trooper and then Lost River was proof that this was one of
the sources. At this point I decided caving under Bowling Green
wasn't for me.
4/16 This weekend I found myself with very little to do
schoolwise, so I began to look for things to do. It turned out
that I had little influence on what I could do: I could go on the
Grotto campout and probably not do much, or try to go to Mammoth
and-go caving. Of course I chose going to Mammoth and Geary, who
had invited me, set about trying to get me into CRF in one day.
He couldn't get ahold of Ron Wilson who was in charge of
membership, but instead got in touch with the expedition leader.
She said I could go up but there were no guarantees that I could
go caving.
So we arranged a trip for me with Terry Leithauser, caver and
cave diver extraordinaire. However, when I got to the fieldhouse
on Friday Ron Wilson walked in, handed me some papers and I
filled them out and signed them. So right then I became at least
a temporary J.V. (Joint Venturer) of CRF, and the next morning I
was caving with Richard Zopf, Norm Pace, and John Reitzburg
(another first timer).
We went to Albert's Domes and beyond. Max Kaempfer made it
