11/21 This Saturday, after many diddly people got their diddly
things done, we made it to Sinking Creek once again. While
Geary, Sue and Rose McCrossin mapped upstream off of the main
entrance, Terry Leithauser, who was studying shrimp in Mammoth
Cave, joined us for a while as he studied the biology of the
cave. It was big stuff, the equivalent of the other trunk, but
it got low and wet, fast! So I decided to turn around and go
back to the entrance. Geary pointed out a loop that needed to be
mapped so we zapped 4 shots through it quickly. We didn't get
much mapped but had gotten a quality sketch (such things are
important).
11/26 Thanksgiving in Roppel. I talked Sue and Geary into
taking me up, and then I sat and waited for Win Wright, Philip
Balister and Steve Conner to show up with Bill Koerschner. Ed
Devine was already there and had gone on a short trip with
Borden. Stephens came in later with Jim Currens. A batch of us
went into Cave City to eat our Thanksgiving dinner. After we
were through we found Joe Saunders in the parking lot. As we
stood there hassling him, Win tried to run us down.
Once we had all reaquainted ourselves, we VPI types went to
the motel rooms Win had reserved for us. (Real cavers only sleep
in a motel, the night before a REAL trip, in order to torture
themselves. After all they don't really like comfort.) In the
morning, after breakfast, we went to the fieldhouse and got
ready. We all started in together, but eventually Philip,
Stephens and Win took off ahead since they had farther to go.
Koerschner, Ed, Steve and I went slower, because Bill hadn't been
caving in a while. (When you're used to running its hard to walk,
so I was frustrated.) We eventually hit the B.W.O.B. and started
surveying. We started with the G-Survey and carried it on, after
we connected Clearwater Canyon to the Elephant Trunk. We then
mapped a lead off the E.T. to a mudfill, and after finishing that
went to the Red Tag Special to do some mop-up there. We stopped
after completing 108 shots, and stumbled out of the cave.
We changed, and went into town to fall asleep in Jerry's
while waiting to eat. Then we went back to the motel, to enjoy a
shower and some cold beer (imported, Hart county is dry).
Eventually, we sacked out (about 1 pm), and woke up later to
wander around the room and go back to sleep, so we'd be on a
normal schedule again. In the morning, they drove me back to the
fieldhouse and took off. Later, after I was left alone with the
starving dogs, Sue came to pick me up. And so went Thanksgiving.
I didn't go caving again fall semester, and I happened to
pass all my courses. At Christmas I went with Hillary to Repass
Saltpeter, and on a Trainee drive in Clover Hollow. I returned
to Wuck-U ready to do some caving. (Stay tuned for more of "Why
I wasn't admitted to Harvard.")
1/23 Well I didn't get back into a cave right away. This
weekend I went with Geary, Russ. Miller, Bob Zoellner, Billy
Matlin, George Spence (an English caver who was travelling around
the world) to Sinking Creek to do some more mapping.
I ended up with Billy and Bob, who were both in high school
(being in high school is not a fault, after all where was I the
