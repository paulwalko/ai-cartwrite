year before this? But these two weren't trained by Bill
Koerschner and had some bad ideas). We mapped the small trunk
off the side of the sinkhole, in which the first trunk I mapped
there has its entrance. If you recall, we didn't have permission
to be walking around in the sink, so we had to sneak around the
walls while we were surveying to the trunk. The pigs made it fun
too, they were about five feet high and weren't scared of
anything. So not only did we have to worry about getting
"gut-shot-dead," but also had these pigs nudging us.
Eventually, we got into the cave and started mapping. It
didn't last long. What we did took about an hour, and the rest
of the time we spent poking around.
2/20 Finally, I was going to get some good caving in; Pete
Crecelius was supposed to take me out to the Lunatic Fringe.
However, when I got up to the fieldhouse with Geary, Sue and
George, I found out Pete was sick. Since George and I were the
only people without a cause, I grabbed him and took off for the
B.W.O.B.
We got there in four hours of leisurely walking, and went to
our lead. At A107 off of the Muddy Tube, we started up a crawl
Koerschner thought might have gone to a trunk. I started digging
at the spot that had stopped Bill. A couple minutes later, I
shoved through into a small ballon, and continued to crawl up a
slope. At the top I saw blackness, so when I found I had to dig,
I clawed like a maniac. (We didn't have anything to dig with, so
I used my hands.) After five minutes of digging, I was standing
in virgin trunk.
George popped out of the crawl and we started to explore.
We'd known that this trunk was there for a long time because it
filled a gap in the map between the Elephant Trunk and the Red
Tag Special. This meant it was guaranteed to end both ways. Of
course there could have been sideleads. We didn't find any
though. Happy, we crawled back out to start the survey. We
mapped it in its entirety, and came up with 27 stations and 750
feet.
When were through, it took us four hours to get back out, for
a 15 hour trip. Geary and Sue had gone with Jim Currens and
weren't back yet so we changed and went to sleep. Three hours
later we were forced to wake up and drive back to Bowling Green.
Spring break took me back to Blacksburg for a week of rain.
When I returned, I found out that the water in Lost River had a
couple varieties of toxic chemicals, but the EPA had once again
blown the scunge (you may recall my collecting some of this
before). Other happenings were a major "spill" of something with
a pH of 2 into a sinkhole in the Lost River drainage basin (it
may not have anything to do with it, but the pH meter of the
robot monitor at the Lost River Rise was permanently stuck at 2 a
couple hours later); and then some company was trying to 'dry!
some zinc oxide, contaminated with cadmium and lead, by spreading
it out, in an old strip mine and a farm in Tennessee. So, Lost
River never saw me again, except for peering in the entrance.
