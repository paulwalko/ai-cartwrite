On the Cover
Jimzuther cave is an 87' crawl located just upstream of
Link's Cave in the bend of Sinking Creek at stream level. During
high water or flood the entire cave is underwater. However
during most of the year the cave is dry and full of the sort of
things small animals might leave behind.
The cave was originaly reported by Saunders as Cutoff Cave.
We've been calling it Jim's other cave at the base of the cliff.
Whatever. The end of the cave could possibly be dug. Though I
expect it would be similar to Missing Link Cave - there's as much
cave as you want to remove dirt.
