Always wondered what kind of person it took to work on that
stuff.
Now for some boy meets girl stuff. Linda has been eating her
vegetables and has lost weight. She looks great and they are
getting hitched! Keith Goggin was practicing tieing his knots
when all of a sudden - whoops! - he tied one with some girl named
Dianne. Jackie and Bob did the big real estate thing. Maureen
has been seen making cutesy googoo eyes at one Canadian boy.
Mirna from Puerto Rico is getting married. Cecile would like to
date more, but she doesn't know what her son will think. Bob
Alderson and Chris Amundson have been seen holding hands. Walt
will do the sailing thing over Christmas with who? Carol? Jerry
was seen driving "the family" around in his new van. Carol and
Joe Zo continue in their quest for some fool babysitter. Hungry
bachelors Ed and Joe have been throwing parties to lure little
girls into their danger den. They'll all come runnin' now that
they know Ed kisses like Jabba the Hut. Sue and Dave settled in
Eugene, Oregon where nudity is legal. Sue rides horses all day
and Dave plays with video games 45 hours a week. Their landlord
warned them to clean up the dog shit or they'd have to move out.
Now for some other stuff. Jim found out that people aren't
like toothpaste as he tried to squeeze through the Devil's Pinch.
Stringfellow is now a life member of our fair club. Our
president is now old enough to drink. Glen, I mean Jean, is
running the club store. If it gets any bigger they'll start
selling stock. Karen and Ernst said something about VAR but
nobody caught it. Philip ran Jean's hang glider into a rock
folding it as a hang glider shouldn't. The new fads shootin'
like wildfire through the club these days are trucks and guinea
pigs. By the way, Cecile rolled hers and Lohner sold
his... truck, not guinea pig. Ed enjoyed his breakfast one
morning with Blacksburg's finest after attempting euthanasia of a
few members of the frat boy population in the Hokie House the
night before.
