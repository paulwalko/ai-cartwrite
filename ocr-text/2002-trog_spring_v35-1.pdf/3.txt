Note from the Prez
by Katherine Ferguson
Reprinted from the Cave Club Listserv.
No one will ever be excluded from club
meetings or events without just cause. Each
one of us contributes priceless amounts of
knowledge, skill, and friendship. Without these
contributions, the club would be nothing. My
hope for this club is that the younger members
of the club put as much passion and time into
the club as possible and that the older members
allow the younger ones to implement new ideas
and find their way to caver wisdom through
action. I hope that all of us can look at how the
campus community views us (militant assholes)
and work to change that negative image. I hope
that all of us look at how the caver community
views us (competent and knowledgeable) and
work to uphold that positive image. I hope that
we use every possible means to attract cavers to
our club. I hope that we will be friendly and
inviting to new people without being pushy or
demanding
I hope that everyone who wants to cave will be
able to cave at the level they desire.
Above all, I hope that this will be a safe and fun
year for all of us. If you have concerns or ideas
on how to make this club better, please let me
know (katherine@vt.edu). Thanks to all of you
who have talked to me already.
