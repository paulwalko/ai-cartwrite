Cavin' in Kuwait
submitted by Kristen Matak
Pat Smith, a long-time West Virginia caver,
was sent to Kuwait as a member of the West
Virginia National Guard. This is an ex cerpt
from an email he recently sent to WVACS
friends, and I thought it was an interesting caver
interest story.
Yes I'm still alive and kickin'! Many thanks to
everyone for the mail.... The pictures made me
reminisce about the good old days, and yow to
partake of much revelry when I get back! If
anyone wants to buy me a beer when I return I
should be a real cheap drunk by then!
Anyways for the most part we have been
working around Camp Doha (oh what a lovely
vacation spot....) It's f***in' hot and everything
smells really bad... If they had a weather
station, that would be the forecast: “Today it
will be smelly and damn hot, the extended
forecast is smelly and really damn hot with a
chance of blowing sand.”
I have also had the pleasure of driving around
Kuwait some. The freeways here are actually
very modern. Kuwait has several different
"road rules.” Here are my favorites:
1) The fastest car has the right of way.
2) Stop signs are suggestions (for real!)
3) Avoid women wearing burkas. (They have no
side vision whatsoever! Imagine four jumping
kids in this car... if one kid pulls on the burka,
the veil goes over the eyes... now you have a
blind woman driving a big car full of screaming
kids at a high rate of speed! Scary!)
4) Try to keep the emergency lane clear, but if
you do need to stop (to use the restroom, buy
a soda, or whatever) feel free to just stop the
car in the middle of whatever lane you are in
and leave it!
Not much else is new, our camp is crowded, but
the accommodations could be a lot worse (sort
of like living at WVACS... minus the booze).
So far the only caves I have found here are
small 8-10' long very small lizard holes.... I
have actually been trying to get back into
caving over here.... The attached picture is
from one of our searches for the elusive grotto!
