it around the boulder. Just as Chuck and I
prepared to pull like hell, Dennis knocked
loose one or two smaller rocks and all I saw was
the end of the tenstrong disappearing down the
entrance. This was followed by a thud.
Now the hole was big enough for Bill
(Stringfellow) or Gary (Moss) to get through.
Again, we donned our caving gear. Chuck told
Dennis he could go first, since he had done all
the work. Actually, I think Chuck was afraid of
the snake, which was surely crushed.
We rigged a rock, and Dennis rappelled and
took the left passage. Chuck followed, going
right. Dennis said he could see Chuck's light
from where he was - and that the entrance
didn't have to be rappelled. I rappelled in,
following Chuck's path.
We followed the passage, admiring the virgin
passage and noting where to find our way out.
I was really impressed, being a trainee and
seeing my first virgin cave. Continuing along
the passage, we crawled through some small
breakdown and down through some really
loose shale which broke if you even thought
about using it as a foothold. This brought us to
a room above a drop which appeared to be 40
to 50 feet deep.
The floor we were on was really bad. A stream
ran through the middle, coming in on the left.
From above, we had seen a passageway across
the area where we were. We climbed over a
conglomerate boulder that broke in our hands
as we climbed, then up the wall to the passage.
At its entrance, there was a rock that looked
like a mallard in flight. The passage became the
Duck Walk. Someone short could duck-walk
this passage. It ran 75 feet. We noted soda
straws and rimstone pools along the way.
The Duck Walk ended at some breakdown. We
were tired. We wanted to go back to the party.
We decided not to push more passage. We sat
down and had a gorp break. Going down from
the Duck Walk above the pit was scary with so
much exposure. The floor beside the
conglomerate rock was small pebbles and loose
rock, which fell through an opening where the
water went down in the floor.
Past this, up the shale we went. Back at the
entrance, we were tired, happy, and feeling
triumphant about our new cave - Spring
Hollow.
