An Adjustable Spacer for Rappel Racks
by Mark H. Eisenbies
In October of 2000, I was a member of a team
of VPI cavers who participated in Bridge Day
and rappelled off the New River Gorge Bridge
in Fayetteville, West Virginia. At just over 700
feet, the rappel was probably my longest to
date, and several of us had some difficulty
picking the right configuration of our racks on
our first rappels. Several of us found ourselves
feeding the rope through our racks while using
five brake bars.
On long drops, acquiring the right balance
between friction and smoothness can be a
challenge. Maintaining the proper spacing,
particularly between the first three bars, can be
tricky because of their tendency to jam together
due to the weight of the rope. Since attempting
long rappels like this on four bars is
undesirable, many cavers resort to the use of
spacers in order to maximize smoothness while
keeping five bars engaged. This article will
describe an adjustable spacer using a simple
hose clamp within a SMC stainless steel brake
bar. While this method has surely been
independently developed elsewhere, I have not
encountered it as of yet.
According to Smith and Padgett (1996), the use
of spacers is a radical and dangerous addition
to your rappel rack. However, Smith and
Padgett also state that one of the challenges of
using a rappel rack is preventing the second bar
from overheating. They recommend the use of
spacers as one method for controlling the
heating of the second bar, although on the next
page they rebuff them as a "drastic"
modification by reducing the available friction
by up to 30%. How this 1/3 reduction in
friction should be considered more drastic than
a 1/3 reduction in friction by changing from
aluminum to steel bars (Smith and Padgett,
1996) is not explained.
Whether or not Smith and Padgett can reach a
consensus on the use of spacers isn't the point.
Rappelling is an inherently dangerous activity,
and I assume no particular responsibility for
the use or misuse of the following suggestion.
It is always prudent to practice with any
changes to your vertical technique in a
controlled environment before utilizing a
change underground.
Traditionally, spacers are constructed from
pipes, springs, washers, nuts, or any other item
that can be placed on the U-frame of the rack
to set the minimum distance between the first
and second bar (see Figure 1). For years I used
two 0.6 inch pieces of PVC pipe to serve this
function. The rest of my rack consists of a
solid, 3/4 inch, grooved, stainless steel top bar,
and SMC stainless steel U bars. I have been
using this particular rack since 1990. While I
weigh 170 lbs., a four or five-bar rappel
commonly is my preference. I have never had
the occasion to use all six bars.
