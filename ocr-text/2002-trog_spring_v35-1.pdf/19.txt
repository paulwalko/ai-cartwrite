ENDNOTE
Chris Nicola, who developed this method,
named it the UAYCEF System after the
Ukrainian American Youth Caver Exchange
Foundation (UAYCEF), which he co-founded
with Ed Sira and Ukrainian caver Valeriy
Rogozhnikov. Chris attributes Bob
Zimmerman with first teaching him about knot
climbing but stated in the article that the long
hours with Valeriy in the deep pits of Crimea
are what really honed his vertical skills. Thus,
he felt the system should bear the name of the
organization they founded. If you'd like to find
out more about doing some Ukrainian caving
check out the UAYCEF website listed under
references. Chris has tentative plans to lead his
ninth caving trip to the Ukraine this August.
This website also has a link to Chris' original
knots article. I highly recommend reading the
original article, which goes into much greater
depth.
