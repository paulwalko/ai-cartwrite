Dale and I concurred; we should wait for
rescue. Baxter, Ed, and Jack set about
determining the points of contact and rocking
the raft in an effort to dislodge it. Straight
down river, sycamore trees choked our way. We
were caught in a strainer. Behind us the river
pinned our craft tightly into the trees. Two
pleasant hours passed and we were wedged
more, not less.
Ed was restless. It was his raft anyway, and he
had an idea. Why didn't we just cut off the back
deck, reducing the raft by a third, and perhaps
we could squeeze between the trees and be free.
Dale and I still thought we should wait for
rescue, but Ed wore us down. We scooted to
the front of the raft and Ed removed the top
stabilizing board. The raft instantly de-
stabilized and began to flex. We renewed our
rocking efforts but remained stuck, so Ed
squatted beside the rear deck and cut again.
Flop! Just that quickly, the raft - and ourselves
- reconfigured. The rear deck went free, the
middle deck dropped into a neat right angle to
the last remaining deck, and my end of that last
deck went skyward at a 40 degree angle. Wow,
I was Queen of a Bent Plyboard. Ed sat on the
downward end, his butt dipping slightly into
the water. Dale was parked in the middle like
the perfect bowl of porridge, not too hot and
not too cold. Jack was in a tree, and Baxter was
heading downstream with another yard sale.
This one was more like a neighborhood yard
sale. It included our spool table and everything
tied to it. Baxter snagged a post and lunged for
the spool.
Miraculously, he caught it. He worked in the
cold water for a long time, fighting the current
to secure all our stuff. I begged him to leave it
and get back on board before he went
hypothermic, but he sort of pretended not to
hear me. Finally I realized that it was
impossible for him to re-trace even one step
against the current. We tossed him some inner
tubes and he disappeared quickly.
We were no longer warm, dry and safe. It seems
ludicrous that we compromised the situation
further. We were not particularly comfortable,
but we weren't drowning, either. The advantage
should have been clear.
The second deck was still folded in a right angle
causing turbulence and was apparently the
cause of our last remaining plyboard half high
and half low. When Ed proposed cutting the
second deck free, we all imagined it dropping
neatly away, leveling our perch. We would be
much more comfortable sitting on a level
plyboard and maybe Jack could come down out
of his tree.
Why did we think we could predict the action
of some boards pinned by a river? Our whole
situation was a demonstration of evidence to
the contrary. We had already seen Dale's
helplessness overboard; we had already felt a
demonstration of the force and its
unpredictability... not once, but twice.
The madness of it struck me along with the
certain knowledge I would be much better off
in the tree with Jack during this experiment.
Quick on the heels of that realization came an
oppressive feeling of regret that I hadn't been
paying attention to my surroundings at a
critical and irrevocable time, and that it was too
late. I reached for a branch I would never
touch.
The water was shocking, shocking! Gasping,
fighting debris, fury drove me. Fury at our
stupidity, my inattention, all the little missteps
that culminated in my launching like a rock in a
slingshot from high and dry and safe to low and
in
small and downstream of the mess of our raft.
What was left of it rode high as it came apart
and swept toward me. Twine was everywhere
and it was bound around my right ankle. This is
the part where I probably would have drowned
struggling to both stay afloat and free myself. I
could almost taste my anger at it all coming
down to this, drowning on float trip on a
beautiful day due to massive group stupidity.
Horrible pictures and words flashed through
my mind of being dragged underwater and
pinned, and dragged while I drowned.
"Have you heard the news?”
“Laine drowned on Float Trip!”
“Oh, my God!"
“I knew we would lose someone, it was just a
matter of time.”
“I knew it too, I just knew it. I've said it more
?
