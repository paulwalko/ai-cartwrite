A Rock Climber Crossing Over to the "Dark" Side
by Chris Michie
Coming from a background of fancy shoes and
dynamic rope, the adjustment towards the
vertical caving community has had its shares of
difficulty. It was not that long ago when I
would call up a few friends and drive to a little
known bluff where we would spend the last of
the daylight hours following our morning
classes climbing slabs of granite and limestone.
“Run up to the top and set up a belay," my
friends would call, as they strapped on their
harnesses and squeezed their toes into shoes
that were three sizes too small.
Ten minutes later, I would return to the
bottom, only to see one friend chalk up his
hands to take the first climb. I pulled out my
ATC belay device from my pack, and after a
few brief commands, off he went. Sticking to
the walls like Spiderman, he used every smallest
crack and crevasse to pinch, catch, tweak or
grab in order to make one more move. Three
quarters the way up the wall I saw him slowly
extend his foot to step on a ledge no more than
one eighth of an inch wide, but as he finished
the move, the skimp of limestone that was his
foothold gave, and I heard a stuttered cry:
"Falliiiiing.” As his worn fingers suddenly got
three times the amount of load, they gave from
fatigue and I felt a small jolt in my harness as
the dynamic rope stretched to catch his fall.
“Well at least you weren't on a lead,” I called to
him, as he regained his strength to attempt the
move a second time. “You would have been
four feet above your belay point, and that
wouldn't feel too good." "Yeah, that would
have sucked,” he responded, grateful that he
only fell a couple inches. Climbing back on the
rock, he finished the climb, and I lowered him
forty feet so someone else can try the wall.
When I entered into the caying community, I
had one goal in mind: I wanted to go vertical. I
bugged the Vice President to take me on one
more horizontal trip to fulfill the requirements
for the first vertical trip. As I entered into the
darkness of Links, I noticed the great
advantage that the cool damp air would give
comfort to the hot summer heat, as well as the
sub freezing temperatures for which
Blacksburg is so well known. Remembering the
two hundred foot rappels that frightened me as
a child, and the 5.10 climbs that thrilled me as
a new Hokie, I felt that I was ready for
whatever these big holes in the ground would
have to offer.
However, the moment I first squeezed through
the Nasty, I realized that I had a lot to learn. As
I entered into the canyon section for the first
time, I noticed the first major difference
between the two sports. Rock climbing uses a
lot of foot friction. I gingerly reached my foot
across the gap and tried to find some friction
on the sloped ledge on the other side, but to no
avail. I knew that from this point forward, I had
to take a new approach to maneuvering at
heights above the ground. After learning the
fine art of canyoning, and watching a well
experienced vice president bolt around the
Whale's Tail, I began to appreciate the value of
caving experience, as I slid my butt cheek onto
the jutting rock and peered around the corner.
After a blazing, and very physical Links trip
that logged all of an hour and a half, I looked
forward to the following Friday, where I could
try my hand at some real vertical caving.
As I sat down at the next meeting among
strange old fogies that kind of smelled funny, I
was shown the kind of thrill that keeps these
cavers coming back for more, as the
presentation of the Mexico Pits began. As
visions of 1400-foot rappels danced in my
head, I later spoke up and asked for a first time
vertical trip.
As embarrassed as I was the night before, the
next morning was nothing but excitement as I
stood next to a fairly large crack in the
limestone, and asked, “So where is the cave?”
Reexamining my current location, I realized
that I was about to rappel a mysteriously large
distance into complete darkness... and I was
completely thrilled. As I clipped my rack onto
eleven-millimeter thick PMI static line, I noted
another fascinating difference between the two
sports. The rope is stiff. My mind was blown
