than once.”
"Oh, my God!"
But I was wearing a life jacket, one of the two
life jackets I saw that day. My heroic orange and
purple life jacket held me up while I dragged
the twine from my legs with both hands. Free,
I began turning to face downstream to see what
I was heading toward.
I hit the tree as I turned, a sycamore with the
circumference of a dinner plate. I hit it hard, on
the left side of my chest, and stuck. The river
nailed me like crucifixion to that tree. I gulped
down several big mouthfuls of water,
wondering whyl was drinking. I wasn't thirsty.
Then the river fought itself, vying to pin me
there while washing me down river. Slowly,
with great pressure, it scraped me around the
side of the tree until the downstream force
ripped me loose. The feeling was similar to that
moment between losing control of a car and
wrecking it. I saw an inner tube about ten feet
away and swam hard toward it.
If I had managed to escape the twine without
my life jacket, I surely would have lost the
battle at the sycamore. Especially since I would
have been pinned lower in the water. My life
jacket protected my chest on the impact but it
almost knocked the breath out of me even with
the padding. It's unlikely I could have caught
up with the inner tube after the encounter. I
caught the inner tube and looped my left arm
through the hole.
Curiously, my backpack was floating on my
right arm. Even with the life jacket, I was quite
low in the water. I grabbed someone's very nice
cave pack as it went by. I now had to choose my
side of the river. The left was closer, but.
equidistant on the right I saw Ed, Dale and Jack
perched on a conglomerate of inner tubes. Jack
had opted to leave his tree rather than be left
alone.
I opted to head left for land as quickly as
possible. I had no idea what kind of situation
we were heading into. Far ahead was a point
where the river hooked left and out of sight. I
intended to make land before that point. If I
could.
Like a cheap appliance, I have two speeds: “on”
and “off.” The “off” speed is unpredictable.
The extra struggle of salvaging the blue cave
pack could easily sap strength I might need. My
backpack still had flotation, mysteriously, even
with the big wool sweater and bottled water and
chicken inside. I thought I could tow the cave
pack to land, but land wasn't near and the inner
tube, the backpacks and I were simply
rocketing toward the unknown. It wasn't worth
the risk. With great reluctance and cursing
apologies to its owner, I let go of the cave pack
and it quickly went down.
I was strangely small and light now. The feeling
was faintly familiar... it was like almost being
out of body – like the summer I lost too much
weight but enjoyed a lightness that made me
feel pleasantly as though the wind could blow
me away, dancing like a leaf. It was how I had
imagined being an ant in a bathtub would feel
like, perhaps as a child watching an ant floating
on tempestuous, child-generated seas. Or a
leaf, or a water bug denting the aquatic tension.
I was exhausted by my sprint for the inner tube,
by the suddenness of my plunge into Hell. I was
terrified I would strike underwater rocks and be
torn apart, and at that speed, life jacket or no,
it was eventually a sure thing. For awhile,
though, I could do nothing but cling to the
inner tube and backpack, catch my breath and
ride downstream.
Water Dave's (David Parks) advice for escaping
turbulent streams entered my head. The trick
was swimming upstream at a 45 degree angle
from land. At the time, it had seemed horribly
counter-intuitive and dubious. Now I was
ecstatic to put all my trust in Dave, and have a
formula. I managed to haul myself on top of the
inner tube and could immediately see much
better than from my low-water position. I
remember thinking, “All right. Now I have a
chance.
Some time later I made shore with the help of
a fallen tree reaching into the water. It was the
type of place I normally would have avoided as
"snakey" but at this time it was a great help as
the current was just as high and fast along the
land. I gave a few shouts to scare off any of the
armless legless critters. My Dad had taught me
