BANQUET - A SMASHING SUCCE88
This year's Banquet was a bit smaller than
usual, possibly due to a shoddy job on the part
of the invitations folks. However many of the
usual suspects still turned out for the feast,
which was again catered by Steve Williams.
Awards included many things silly and
frivolous, yet we managed to seriously thank
Kirk Digby for his many contributions with the
A.I. Cartwright award.
The main entertainment of the evening was
provided by a swing made of webbing and
rigged from the ceiling. Cavers, booze, and
high speed toys - not a good combination!
Banquet speaker Chip Clark had a “crashing.”
good time this year. He stepped into the path
of Steve LePera on the webbing swing and they
both went into a table of drinks. Chip and Steve
got up laughing, but the table didn't fare as
well.
Before breaking tables, Chip gave an excellent
presentation of mixed content: he dug up à
bunch of random photos and had an interesting
tale to tell about each one. Who says we need
pictures of caves to keep us awake?
In a battle of young vs. older, Mike Cole
refused to end the music until there was
nobody left dancing, and Ed Loud and Lynn
Morgan refused to stop dancing until the music
ended! The battle raged on until the sun came
up, and finally ended in a draw. Let's see this
again next year!
PARIS? MAIS NON.
Unfortunately, another yearly tradition did not
take place this year. Usually a group of old farts
makes their way to Europe for a long weekend.
However due to recent terrorism and other fi-
ascoes, the trip just didn't quite happen. Better
luck for next year's travel.
HOUSING
Slum lord Lawrence Britt is paying three caver
lackeys to fix up and paint the blue house on
Wilson Avenue. Now it's really blue – half of it,
anyway. Kirk Digby, Pam Mohr, and Chris
Garguilo plan to drag out the project for as
long as they can.
Recent events have convinced Chip Mullins to
move out from Ray's old place where he was
rooming with Chris Garguilo. He's now living
in his frat house. Interestingly, Sam Lambert
doesn't have to memorize a new phone number
to reach her boyfriend.
Amanda Stiles has moved in with Penelope
Pooler on Meadowbrook in the space
abandoned by Nikky LaBranche. People can't
seem to move into a new place without getting
a dog, so of course Amanda now has Connie, an
adorable Australian something-or-other.
EJUKASHUN 18 GUD
Congrats to Paul Hess, who is now Dr. Paul.
We can hear it now: “Let me examine that for
you, miss. It's okay, I'm a doctor." Don't be
fooled! He's just another engineer.
And just when are Steve LePera and Ko
Takamizawa going to finish their - oops, we're
not allowed to ask about that.
AND ANOTHER....
Jeff Leach, KG4SUB. Need help remembering
this? Just think “sonuvabitch.”
MOVING ON - We'll Miss You
After graduation in May, Matt Stec and his wife
Stacy will be heading out to Boise, Idaho. Matt
has taken a job with Hewlett-Packard.
Congrats, Matt!
Andy Yeagle also graduates, but hasn't found a
job yet. As soon as he finds one “someplace
cool” he's outta here.
Chris Hibshman and his wife Michelle are soon
moving to NOVA. Chris has found a dorky
engineering job, while Michelle will find a
teaching position once there. Chris swears
they'll be back for all the “important” club
functions.
Sue Setzler is also seeking employment. She
and Megan are heading to Tennessee, where
they'll catch up to Doug Bruce. Hopefully they
will each still find time to visit us in the 'Burg.
