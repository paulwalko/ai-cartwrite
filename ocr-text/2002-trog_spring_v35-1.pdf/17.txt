explained more fully in the comments section
after the entire system is described. You can
also complete a Helical with a Figure Eight.
MAINLINE
From the Figure Eight on your D-ring, pull the
line taut and tie a Helical at approximately your
chin level or slightly lower. If there is
substantial cord length left over after tying
your top knot, you can cut it (making your
handline shorter) or bind it in some way to keep
it out of your way.
After you have tied all of your knots and before
you start climbing, you might want to take a
Sharpie or laundry marker and mark the
placement of the knots on your knot cord so
that you can easily recreate or adjust these
lengths in the future.

From this Helical knot, measure out a length of
rope down to below your knees and back up to
your harness D-ring (or whatever connection
link you use). Tie a Figure Eight on a Bight at
this point and slip the bight loop on to your D-
ring (see Figure 3). There should be enough
length of cord between the bottom Helical and
this Figure Eight connection to your harness so
that this line is never taut when you're
climbing

You are now ready to start climbing. In a
mechanical frog system, your feet are attached
to your upper ascender, and your chest is
attached to an ascender below that, which is the
reverse of the knots connections described
here. Despite this difference, Chris Nicola
adopted the â€œFrog' name for this system, and I
agree, because its use feels very similar to the
frog motion on the rope. Move your top Helical
knot up the mainline as far possible. Rest your
weight on your top knot and pull your bottom
Helical knot up as you fold legs up in a kneeling
position. Stand on the foot loops to unweight
your top knot, and simultaneously slide the top
knot up as far as possible. Repeat motions until
you have climbed to the top of the given climb.
