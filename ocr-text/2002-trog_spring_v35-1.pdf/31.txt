they didn't want to be around me any more
than I wanted to be around them. I also
shouted and waved so the faraway guys could
see I was ok. “I--HAVE--CHICKEN,” I yelled.
Down the railroad track in the middle of
Lonelyville I plodded. I felt I could handle
anything that came my way - spending the
night in the woods, fighting homeless men,
murderers, ghosts, whatever. It was all so easy
next to trying not to drown. Every time I came
to a railroad outbuilding I wrote my name with
coal, the day, the time and an arrow pointing
the way I was going. Eventually I stopped to
rest on a large boulder and solved the mystery
of the floating backpack. Dale's chicken was in
ziplock bags. Lots and lots of ziplock bags, all
full of air!
I heard the freight train coming as I uncouthly
gobbled chicken. Good. I would wave at the
engineer. Not an Emergency Life or Death
Help wave, but not quite a Friendly-Howdy
wave either. What I needed was the kind of
wave that said, “do notice I probably shouldn't
be out here alone in my bikini, and mention it
to some official preferably soon.” I waved a
chicken leg at the approaching train. The sun
was on its front window and I couldn't see the
engineer. As the train pulled past I looked
directly into the cabin. In silhouette, the
engineer was intently reading a book. I shouted
meekly and he dropped the book. I waved the
chicken leg again, and he leaned out of the
window, shouted something back at me and
pointed down the tracks in the direction I was
going. I took that to mean, “There are people
coming that way looking for you.” It turned out
to mean, “I am stopping the train and you can
talk to the man in the caboose.” Never
underestimate the power of a chicken leg.
So now I was in Heaven again. Standing on the
back porch of the caboose, high above the
sparkling river with a sweet breeze in my face.
Golden sunlight sifting through gorgeous green
leaves, on one of those absolutely perfect days.
The train backed up, generously carrying me
toward the take-out point. Eventually we met
up with the hapless sergeant in his white truck,
on his day off and not at his family barbecue. I
was transferred from the train to the sergeant,
and the train reversed directions and chugged
off. I felt bad the engineer hadn't gotten to eat
any of the chicken.
I was the first of our group to arrive back at the
take-out, hours behind everyone else. I started
to feel pretty bad as the day caught up with me.
My aching legs were horrendously bruised from
the sycamore. It wasn't too long before Jack,
Ed and Dale arrived but it was hours until we
found Baxter. He had last been seen going
underwater at the head of an island. It turned
out that he was diving to avoid a tree limb.
Then our mast came along and fortuitously
speared right through his inner tube hole and
made itself useful as a rudder. When he made
land at a steep little cliff, it served as a ladder.
Baxter had his own set of adventures but they
will have to wait for another day. Baxter's a
class act, and he sent a case of steaks to the
ranger who had to leave his family barbecue
and “put his boat into that water" to look for
him. Cave Club people at the take-out were
very caring, wrapping us up in blankets and
dosing us with wine for medicinal purposes. We
were all worried about Baxter and so glad to
find out later that he was ok.
And the Moral of the Story... don't make this
the year we have your funeral!
On hearing my tale, almost everyone I spoke
with reacted with some variation of how
fortunate it was that I happened to be wearing
my life jacket. It wasn't fortune. I happened to
be wearing my life jacket because I happen to
always wear it on the river as a matter of policy.
Even at normal levels, it's a particularly
dangerous river. Because of its age, it is
notoriously unpredictable in currents, depths,
and rock ledges. When things go bad on the
river, they tend to go WAY bad, WAY fast. You
can be Mark Spitz and still not swim well if
drunk, stoned, hit on the head, hit in the chest,
tangled in twine, or any number of other pesky
little problems.
Today's life jackets are very comfortable and
not restrictive like the old ones. Hint, hint. I an
beating a dead horse here. I am not writing this
story on my day off for my health. Please have
fun on float trip this year. And please be
careful. Respect the river. Drowning probably
sucks even more than almost drowning.
