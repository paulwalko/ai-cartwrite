We all rappelled down,
some of us in leaps and bounds,
till we hit the floor of rock.
Some had never done this cave before,
it was like opening a new door,
and they were in for a good shock.
Even after all this
there was still plenty time on the clock.
Down the pit we go, not moving slow.
Trying to make it every where we can.
Down the Dragon's Tail,
to the gypsum flowers â€œnever fail!"
even to the library stand.
Then back to the above ground land.
We dropped the nuisance pits,
then did the sits,
till the canyon drop was rigged.
Most of the people were wired,
fortunately not very tired,
and starting to realize how dangerous the
gig.
To ease our minds
we started talking about roasted pig.
The trip was quite a few hours,
yet no one was very sour.
. We even got out by the mid of day.
No one complained
as a few cold beverages got drained
as we made it back to town
perfectly ok.
Then we did a different trip the next day.
