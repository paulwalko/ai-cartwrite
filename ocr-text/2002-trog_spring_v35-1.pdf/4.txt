Honaker Cave - A Great Intro into the Club
by Travis Coad
The first trip I went on with the Cave Club is
probably the best trip so far. This trip was in
the spring of 1999 to a cave called Honaker,
somewhere near the Virginia/West Virginia
border. The trip consisted of David Hill, John
Deighan, Kevin Rock, and myself. David Hill
was in town and had come by the meeting
mentioning that he wouldn't mind going to the
cave, so I went.
Who knows when we left, and who cares? This
is about caving, not times and dates. We got to
the house, where I am guessing the land owner
lives, said hi, and chatted for a while checking
to make sure it was all right to park the cars
there and go caving. They said it was no
problem. From this point until we were actually
in the cave I must have blacked out, because I
do not remember how we got to the entrance or
even what it looked like, so I will just skip that
part.
Once inside the cave, there were a lot of cool
passages, most of which you could stand in
The cave was highly decorated with formations
and had several large flowstones, one of which
stands out vividly in my mind. There was a
room we came upon that was about 20 feet
wide and 30 feet long (for those that use metric,
you figure it out). As you came into the room,
off to the left was a massive flowstone that was
about 15 to 20 feet wide at the ceiling and
flowed down to the floor in a large mushroom
shape formation. At the base of the formation
were numerous rimstone dams that came out
into the middle of the room. Beyond the
rimstone dams there was a steep mud slope
with a mudslide to the right where water drains
into a large basin that was about 30 feet deep.
David Hill told us that he had never seen this
before because it was usually full of water up to
the rimstone dams.
Kevin and I decided to go into the basin to see
what was at the bottom. We found lots of mud
and in one place we found a piece of 2x4
sticking out of really soft mud. Thinking that it
was small we started to pull the 2x4 out, but it
ended up being about 4 to 5 feet long. This
â€¢ This
gave us the general notion that we needed to be
careful where we stepped or we would end up
like that 2x4. Once bored with that, (no pun
intended) we had to go back up the steep mud
slope we had so easily come down.
Unfortunately, it wasn't so easy going back up.
Later in the trip, we went into another room
that was called the Echo Room. You can guess
why it is called that, but from what I remember,
it didn't really echo that much. This room,
however, had a really interesting up sloping
entrance hole that you had to squeeze through.
I think this is where I burnt my hand with a
carbide lamp for the first time. The room also
had a rather large flowstone about 10 feet wide
and 15 feet long that flowed near the floor; it
was definitely worth pushing my way through
the hole to see.
Also during the trip, I had a few heart racing
moments. While John and Kevin were off
exploring some passage that leads to who
knows where, David, the only one who knew
the cave, went off ahead through the next
passage we were going into. I was just sitting
around taking a break somewhere between
John, Kevin, and David, when out of no where
I heard large rocks fall and David yell.
Considering this was my first trip, I wasn't
quite sure what to do. I got John and Kevin out
of their little hole and we started looking for
David. We found him, he was fine, he had just
slipped and kicked rocks down while he was
climbing. Later, after I had calmed down from
that, Kevin and John went off again to explore.
Not long after, I heard John yelling to Kevin.
At that time I was thinking that he was just
trying to find where Kevin was, but soon after,
Kevin appeared and told David that John was
stuck in a hole. So David, Kevin, and I ended
up having to haul John out of this hole. All the
while I was thinking that we were never going
to get him out, and we'd have to go get help.
After a few minutes of pulling really hard on a
piece of webbing we got him out, but then we
had to wait until he got the feeling back in his
had
legs before continuing on.
