had some problems with his female parts, but
claims it's okay because he's going to Hawaii.
Club members are getting more generous these
ous these
days, hiding actual good beers. This is a trend
many of us heartily support. (No offense, of
course, to Wells and his treasured Olympia.)
HE THINKS Caving 18 DANGEROUS?! .
In a spectacular performance, Philip Balister
recently crashed while riding his road bike. He
didn't get very far on the ride before his rear
wheel came off, sending him over the handle
bars. He's still with us because he was wearing
a helmet, but that didn't save him from getting
lots of road rash.
After his great wreck Philip pedaled back to
Sandy's house longing for training wheels. In
an interesting twist, his wife continued on the
bike ride while Karen Everhardt supervised
him in the shower.
YÍR
Another early spring, another chance for our
younger members to hit on chicks from other
grottos. The VPI new members and trainees
made us all proud with their dogged persistence
by the fire. This time, however, we had a special
treat as one of the women threw herself
shamelessly at an eligible Blacksburg male.
The cool thing about YTR, as far as caver
events go, is that people actually go caving.
Lots of trips went out with a good mix of
grottos participating. Sandy Knapp lead one of
her famous trips to Organ Cave with help from
Ray Sira. VPI folks went caving with WVACS,
NCRC, WVU, JMU, and other several other
acronyms. Judi Wasilewski even drove from
Chicago to get in on the action.
LET'S DISCUSS THE BY-LAWS – NOTI
This past semester has seen more
speleopoliticing in the club than the past seven
years put together. Checking email was a
dangerous thing, because you never knew if
there was two or twenty-two posts to the
listserv arguing the next hot topic.
It all began with the Secret By-laws Committee,
designed to consider revamping and
modernizing the by-laws of the club
Constitution. Once people started feeling
snubbed by the committee, the emotions
steamrolled until many of the committee
members resigned.
That was followed by the young students
planning a coup to overthrow the older
members. Before any blood was shed,
Katherine Ferguson stepped in and managed to
make peace between the two tribes.
After all the commotion, only three motions
were made to change the by-laws, and those
three were the most innocuous of all. It's
possible that the motivation to stir up more
trouble died down because people were tired of
reading long-winded emails.
At this point, most members of the club are
still speaking to one another.
CLUB RESCUE GEEKS
Alison Williams and Brian Ekey continued their
journey towards ultimate rescue geek by getting
their cardiac certification. Now they have the
official authority to say, “Yup. His heart
stopped."
PIGNIC
Ah, another rainy, dog-infested Picnic. This
year's eating and drinking binge was sponsored
by an anonymous donor (thank you whoever!).
This allowed enough funds to get a roasted pig.
Between Ray's ubiquitous chili and other
potluck contributions, it was quite a feast.
In the spirit of having lots of good food at
Picnic, the treasurer is taking donations
towards next year's event. If you enjoyed the
food and bevies at this one, please toss a few
dollars his way.
In a fairly new tradition, several bikers rode out
to Picnic on Friday: Steve LePera, John
Deighan, Wil Orndorff, John McKenna, and
Danny Zokaites made the 48-mile trek that day,
making pretty good time. In fact, some think
Danny's fast pace was a driving force behind
Wil's time – can't get beaten by a Zoling, after
all!
Penelope Pooler, Amanda Stiles, and Jeff Leach
straggled in later that evening. Apparently they
left late and didn't make quite as good time.
Even though Jeff bailed partway and hopped in
a vehicle, the other two pushed on and arrived
