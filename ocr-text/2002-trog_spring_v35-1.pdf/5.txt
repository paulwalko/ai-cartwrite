This trip was not only my first, but it was my
best. It showed me what caving is all about. The
trip gave me the delight of seeing very pretty
and unusual formations along with a little heart
racing excitement and danger. The best and
most important thing is that it got me hooked
to the VPI Cave Club and to the techniques of
good responsible caving. All in all, the trip was
great, and everybody that went in came out
with only minor cuts, bruises, and scrapes. It is
a trip I highly recommend, and have wanted to
go do again for quite some time. If anyone
knows the cave, I would love to plan a trip and
take some trainees.
