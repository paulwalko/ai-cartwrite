Quoth the Kirk
by Travis Coad
On a dark and blustery night,
I was startled with such a fright
by a noise outside my window
howling like the wind.
So I let the good man in,
he and all his friends,
and asked what cave we were going through.
Clover Hollow was the choice,
by a unanimous voice,
that no one could distinguish who.
This would be great because
it was a cave I hardly knew.
I peered through the shades,
looking with a daze,
to discover it was just a good ole friend.
His name was Kirk,
bright eyed and bushy tailed,
even though it was 3a.m.
He yells, “Hey, lets go caving,
and stop this schoolish slaving,
before we both drive ourselves insane.”
The thought of whether or not to go,
didn't take me very slow,
it was like a natural reaction in my brain.
And the thought of more work
just made the night seem so mundane.
I gathered up my vertical gear,
locked up the rear,
and away to sign out we went.
We pulled up to the cave,
daring each other who would be brave,
enough to go and rig before more time was
spent.
Unfortunately most insisted
on staying in front of the heater vent.
I looked into his face
and saw that he was in great haste,
wanting to get to the entrance soon.
He said, “I don't know how long it will last,
but it will be a blast,
I'm hoping to be out of there by noon.”
This was a great idea to go caving
under the light of the moon.
We finally got the entrance rigged,
without dropping a twig,
into the pit that lay beneath.
The rest of the caving crew
didn't have a clue,
that the rope was ready
and hanging the 70 feet.
Good grief.
