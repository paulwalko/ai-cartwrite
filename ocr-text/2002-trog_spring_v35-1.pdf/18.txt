You can tie the system onto the mainline in
reverse order starting with the top Helical knot.
This order of tying might allow you to make
larger foot loops to take up some of the left
over cord length and/or to bind up excess cord
length in a knot near your feet and out of the
way. I have never tried to tie on this way, but I
suspect it would work well.
As I mentioned, using one long cord allows you
to carry one line in your cave pack that can be
used for a handline, belay line, or for a knot
system. If, however, you would prefer to have
a system somewhat pre-cut and pre-rigged, you
can use two shorter pieces. The bottom cord
would go from your pre-tied foot loops to the
lower Helical and then be connected to your D-
ring with a pre-tied Figure Eight on a Bight.
The top piece would go from the upper Helical
to your D-ring with another pre-tied Figure
Eight on a Bight (see Figure 5). In addition to
convenience, another advantage of using two
separate pieces to construct the system is that
it results in two independent connections
between the mainline and your D-ring, which is
the preferred level of safety and redundancy in
an ascending system.
the lower Helical to the D-ring could be a
problem because it might result in pulling on
the tail of a Bowline knot. Based on
observations and field practice, I don't think
this is a problem if a Yosemite tie-off is used
because it completes the Bowline knot and
prevents it from deforming under irregular
tension. With respect to the Helical's coils, it
doesn't matter which line coming out of the
knot you pull as long as the coils are being
tensioned from below. This line would only be
weighted if your top connection from the
harness D-ring to the upper Helical was
removed, i.e., the upper rope was cut or the
upper knot broke. In a traditional 3-knot
system, the removal of the upper connection to
the rope would result in doing a heel-hang from
the mainline rope. Remember to never push
down on a Helical knot from the top of the
coils. This will break the knot's grip and cause
you to slide down the rope.
I'm not really sure if this knot climbing system
is easier than the traditional knot system, but it
seems more intuitive and less labor intensive to
me. It does have the disadvantage of not being
acceptable for vertical competitions at OTR
and NSS Convention. For competition
purposes, you must use a traditional 3-knot
system.
I realize some of this may be difficult to picture
without a demonstration. I would be happy to
spend some time with anyone who is interested
in learning to use this system, including but not
limited to, prospective members who need
their knots climbing requirement signed off. As
with any vertical technique, this method is not
set in stone. If you experiment with this knot
system and find a way to improve upon it, I
would really appreciate any insights you have.

had the good fortune to cave with, survey with,

own with the instructions in their original
article, I had the chance to talk with each of
them about this knot system at different times,
which was very helpful.
