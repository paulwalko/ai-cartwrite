for a minute, as I clipped the last bar onto the
rack. This doesn't feel like my pretty Blue
Water static line. A slight bit of concern came
over my face, but as I weighted the rack, I
realized that I was not going anywhere. The
force that I applied in order to pinch the Blue
Water rope was not required for the concrete
cord that I was about to descend upon.
Thinking of a few differences during my
enjoyable first descent, I concentrated on not
burning the rope with the torch mounted upon
my head, as well as wondering when I would be
able touch the ground, since I could not very
easily see where I was going. After the two
other consecutive drops, by the time I had
reached the ninety-foot drop, the descent was
nothing out of the ordinary.
The biggest problem I had adjusting to the new
style of vertical technique, besides all the mud
on my gear, was that there were two very
different methods of going up. Now for years I
have not relied on the rope to support my
weight with the exception of a fall, but when I
was hanging fifty feet off the cavern floor
dangling by a set of loosely tied helical knots,
and feeling the rope sway from my uneven
movements, for the first time on the trip I
became a little nervous. After working over the
lip, I happily climbed out of the hole in the
ground and tried to catch my breath. I later
helped coil the rope, also in a very strange way,
but I could feel nothing but excitement about
the new sport to which I had become
hopelessly addicted.
