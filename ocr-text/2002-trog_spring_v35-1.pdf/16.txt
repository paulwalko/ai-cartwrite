The "UAYCEF" Knot System: The "Knotted Frog"
.. by Penelope Pooler
One of the primary advantages of this knot
system is that it can be constructed from one
long segment of cord. You can make it out of
two shorter segments for convenience, but the
advantage of using one long piece is that the
same cord can also serve as a handline or belay
line in the cave.
To start constructing your knot system, use a
Double Figure Eight or a Bowline on a Bight to
create double foot loops large enough to fit
muddy cave boots (see Figure 1). You do not
need to make the loops large enough to bind
the foot as in a traditional knot system. Even if
you prefer to use one large foot loop when
climbing with a mechanical frog system, two
foot loops are preferable for this system.

by Chris Nicola and edited by Bob Zimmerman

INTRODUCTION
As part of my VPI Cave Club membership
requirements, I had to demonstrate that I could
ascend rope using knots. With permission from
Kevin Rock, the former Vice President, I used
the knot system that I am accustomed to and
was signed off by Kirk Digby, who then asked
me to write an article for the Trog about it. This
article assumes that you know how to tie a
Helical knot, as well as some others mentioned,
and understand the basics of the frog ascending
system. A basic knowledge of how to ascend
rope with knots is also assumed.
When I first became interested in learning more
than basic vertical technique a few years ago, I
was surfing the web and stumbled upon a
reference to an article in the Nylon Highway
(Nicola and Zimmerman, 1999) about a
knotted frog system also dubbed the
“UAYCEF” knot system (see endnote for name
explanation). I basically learned how to climb
with knots from reading this article and
practicing at informal vertical sessions at
various cliffs and friends' backyards in
northern West Virginia. The system
construction described below is similar to that
described in the original article. In my
subsequent comments, I suggest some
alternatives that you may want to adopt.
SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION
To construct this knot system, you'll need 30
feet of the knot cord of your choice. Chris
Nicola's article specifies 6 mm accessory cord,
which is ideal if you want to build a very
lightweight system. After experimenting with
various cord diameters and materials, I've
found that I prefer 8 mm Mammut for
climbing on 11 mm rope. It grips the mainline
really well and you can break the knot fairly
easily when sliding it up. It's a little more
expensive than most other cord choices, but is
very abrasion resistant.

Figure 1 - Create the Foot Loops
While standing in the foot loops adjacent to the
mainline, pull the cord taut from your foot
loops and tie a Helical with a Bowline and
Yosemite tie-off at a height on the mainline
roughly level with the top of your thigh (see
Figure 2). It's important to use a Yosemite tie-
off for the Bowline knot of this lower helical.
As you'll see in the next step, the tail of this
bowline is then connected to your harness. A
Yosemite tie-off is much more likely to prevent
the bowline from capsizing or coming undone
in the unlikely event that this bowline's tail line
to your harness is weighted. This reasoning is
