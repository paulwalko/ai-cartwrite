Saltpetre Room. Mr. Lucas didn't look happy to
learn of the mishap and expressed concern
about the impact on the cave. VPI cavers
assured him that while it made a big muddy
mess and isn't very pretty, the long-term effect
on the actual cave environment is minimal.
ACTUAL CAVING NEWS
Thanks to new landowner relations involving
Carrie Blankenship, the club was given the
chance to ridge walk her family's property in
Narrows. On January 26, a big group of cavers
went out and discovered a cave now called
“Elvis Grotto # 1.” Supreme Ruler Balister is
currently controlling access, so check with him
if you'd like to visit the cave. Almost all leads
have been killed off, but there's still a slimy
high lead which Kevin Rock is anxious to check
out.
This same day of ridge walking turned up a few
other digs with potential. However none of
them have yet produced any cave booty.

EASTER BEER
Despite the drizzly rain, the annual Easter Beer
Hunt took place at the Bat Ranch. Septapus
played their wonderful mix of background
tunes and elevator music, but was it what the
people wanted?
At one point late in the night, Brad Atkinson
took control of the microphone. Apparently he

Who says it takes millions of years for a cave
formation to grow? Tawney's Cave has a new
formation which appeared in a day. It seems the
state of Virginia wanted to get Calvin Lucas'
cows out of Sinking Creek to improve the water
quality, so they paid to have a well drilled in his
field. Despite having a topo map overlaid with
the cave map, they managed to send the well
casing right through Tawney's near the
