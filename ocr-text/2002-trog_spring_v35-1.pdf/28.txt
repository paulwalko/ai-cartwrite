The Strainer: A Tale from Last Year's Float Trip
by Laine Buckwalter
Although I didn't know it at the time, according
to Mike Mike Mike [Horne] later, the river was
6-8 feet above flood level, and 6 degrees
warmer than the water the Titanic went down
in. I did know I'd never been on the river when
it was flowing that fast. But a blue sky was
sporting white puffy cumulous of fair weather,
all the more beautiful because a rainy day had
been predicted. Charlie Mullins, a VA State
Police Sergeant who was there discouraging the
trip, seemed overcautious. It was his day off, he
was going to a family barbecue, and he didn't
want to get called out. He also very definitely
"did not want to put a boat into that water.”
Pooh, pooh. His fears were unjustified. I knew
we wouldn't need him on such a beautiful day.
Our raft, three plyboards wide, was shored with
two underlayers of truck inner tubes and
stabilized by a fourth plyboard lying lengthwise
across the three. The inner tubes and the
plyboard were bound with twine. It was a
sloppy job; excess twine trailed in all
directions. Later, it would almost cost me my
grapes soon. It really didn't get any better than
this.
Aaaahhhhhhhhhh. Heaven....
UH-0000OOHHHHHH! A submerged
forest stood dead ahead. To the left was a wide,
clear expanse of the river, and to the right, an
equally wide expanse. DOH! The narrow forest
was spang in the middle of the river, and we
were headed straight into it like silly cartoon
characters.
“Guys!" I shouted, “Pick a side!” There was
some quick and ferocious poling that had all
the effect of rowing with a toothpick. A crash
imminent, we hunkered down and braced. I
grabbed my life jacket.
WHAM! We lodged in the forest with
astonishing force. Dale toppled over backwards
off the rear deck and went under the corner of
the raft. I tracked his progress through the
boiling water. He swept out from under the
raft, wedged between two trees, and managed
to surface his head. A huge rooster tail
swooshed over his face. He clearly had made no
improvement in his ability to breathe. Finally
he grabbed the side of the raft and we dragged
him aboard. “It was unfortunate,” gasped Dale,
"that I had just breathed out when that
happened.” Dale had lost a favorite hat, his
glasses, and one deck shoe, and his visual range
was reduced to an impractical distance. He was
now more vulnerable.
And we'd had a yard sale. My purple tube and
the foam pad were almost out of sight already,
bobbing down river with impressive speed
along with a thermos, the remains of my straw
hat, and at least one of our poles.
But we were fine. We were in the shade, we
were warm and dry for the most part, we had
water, and Dale put some chicken in my
backpack “for safekeeping.” I wondered mildly
why my backpack was safer than a cooler, and
what was that important about chicken.
Whatever, it made Dale happy. Fine. My eyes
would be opened later.
life.
We were reveling in excess paraphernalia. We
had a construction spool for a table, food and
drink in coolers, four poles and a mast with
pink flagging tape. I was geared in my usual
yearly raft mode: bikini, shorts, a big shirt and
a backpack with a large, ugly wool sweater in a
plastic bag.
I also had a purple floating tube, a long piece of
foam bedding to lounge on, a big straw hat that
had seen many floats and looked it, and a life
jacket.
We put in and immediately shot downstream.
Ed Day had brought his friends Jack and Baxter
for their first float trip. Dale Novotny and I
completed the party.
The guys poled madly to avoid the bridging,
and from there it was smooth, wide and fast. I
lounged on the foam while Dale rubbed my
shoulders and Jack rubbed my feet. The sweet
little breeze was better than a palm fan. I
thought perhaps someone would feed me
