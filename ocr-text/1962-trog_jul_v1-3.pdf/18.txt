LETTERS:
Dear Editor: on behalf of those who have the greatest
interest in James Cave, I want to thank you for your
kindness in publishing my protest to the recent article
by Mr. Griifin. As you seem to agree, it would indeed be
unfortunate for incorrect impressions of the matter to be
created in the minds of "individuals not acquainted with
the entire situation".
At the risk of becoming tiresome however, I will comment on
a few points in the follow-up article, Sara Corrie, who is
quite well acquainted with the entire situation, acted in
good faith. She was, as we all were, shocked and dismayed
by the tone and content of the article, Her reply was not
as carefully prepared as my letter and perhaps was too
hastily written; but since it was not addressed to the
editor, nor intended for publication, is certainly not open
to the same criticism as the article to which it refers.
Larry's contention that his article was not a scientific
work and merely intended for the people at VPI is cer-
tainly invalid. As the official organ for a segment of the
NSS, your publication is no less responsible for its
content than would be the News or Bulletin. Nor is it
restricted to VPI, having virtually nationwide distribution
through inter-srotto exchange. The statement that Larry
did not claim crcdit for the map is weak; the uninformed
reader assumes that the entire content of any article is the
work of its author unless he gives credits to the con-
trary, whether the article appears in the Scientific
American or the Hobo News. Responsibility is the key word
here, whether scientific or "popular", and is pertinent
at all levels,
As to future publications on the cave, at least two are
currently in preparation. It is hoped therefore that
your readers may not have to wait too long before seeing
these in print within the society's publications. It is
very doubtful, however, if there is any one who can give
an accurate picture, completely without bias. Larry has
managed to alienate nearly everyone who might otherwise
qualify - long before his recent article.
