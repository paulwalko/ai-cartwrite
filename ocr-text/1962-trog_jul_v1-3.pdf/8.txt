self is primarily one large room sey eral hundred feet
long, and in excess of 100 feet wide and 50 feet high
in places, several walkways and crawl passages lead
off from the main chamber, and a small stream is found
at the lowest level. Che massiveness of many of the
columns, draperies and spe leo thems is. overwhelming and
many large rimstone pools, filled and empty, were probably

chunks of breakdown "as large as a house" which lie near
the center of che room make one wonder just how stable

Before leaving the cave we placed a cave resister and
