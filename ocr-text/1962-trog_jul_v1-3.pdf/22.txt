1.) My sister loves caving. ÃŽn ber first trip, to Marshall!
Cave in Highland County, the colilent heard most often was,
"Take me out, I'm going to be sick. I think I'm going to
throw up." Later com.ents, after she had escaped alive and ::
without being sick, indic...te that she might be talked into
it again.
2.) Avoid are's Cave in allegheny County, just north of
Covington, unless you have a strong stomach. The place is
full of dead sheep. Before my eyes were fully adjusted to i
the dark I stepped on one. The second was all bloated; the
taird was head first between two boulders, one of which was
covered with blood. All three are highly odiferous and have
to be climbed over to get into the main portion of the cave,
3.) The Wagon Wheel Restaurant in Crows is an excellent
place to eat....if you have lots of time and patience. I
do not exaggerate when I say that we spent fully 90 minutes
waiting for our orders of cheeseburgers, french fries, and
salads. Half of the order was missing, one hard-working
caver passed out from hunger while waiting, and it took
"lirs. Einstein" 30 minutes to figure out the bill. Another
caver was lost when the outhouse rolled off the 40 foot
precipice beind the restaurant,
4.) I would like to suggest the addition of a third word to
the name of a well-known 3ighland County cave. The word is
"anen", the cave is Better Forgotten (amen).
5.) Aqua Cave, Highland County, is now enterred easily i
without getting wet. The new owner, Mr. Illis, is hospit-
able to cavers, quite unlike to ex-owner, ir. Eunett
Lockridge, who is known to have driven off several cavers
at sun point, The water level in the spring has been
lowered by a bulldozer and the swim-in entrance can now be
negotiated by crawling on boards which span the lake., The
natural entrance, a dee, siphon througa which explorers in
passed before the small entrance was opened, seems to have
been blocked during the moving of the rocks. The cave
contains the best examples of ot holes that I have ever
seen. It is also interesting for the fact that the inside
is almost totally black, being coated with a layer, almost
as if everything had had a layer of tar coured over it,
which I understand to be a manganese compound. A sample was
analyzed by Sam Dunaway, and a hasty study revealed a
considerable amount of iron. The cave terbinates in a :
series of siphons, several of which have been penttrated by.
divers. Several thousand feet of cave can now be seen
without getting wet.
