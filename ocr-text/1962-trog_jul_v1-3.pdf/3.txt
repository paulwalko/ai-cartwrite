Higgenbotham 1 (often called Devil's Slide) and
Higgenbotham #2 are looated on the eastern side of knob
Mountain in Thompson Valley, a few miles south of
Tazwell, Virginia. Their entrances are both found in
the bottom of sinkholes less than 1000 feet apart in an
area being prolific with caves and karst features. Both
are considered to be pit caves and little work has been
done in either until recent years, A "more often than
not" stream makes the entrance and exploration of #2
very miserable, while a 140 ft, drop close to the
entrances of #1 makes its exit quite tiring and often
times dangerous. Although neither cave has produced
much in the way of beautiful formations, the large rooms
and passageways, the wells and pits, and the bat populations
make them worth seeing.
To date I have been a member of six trips to the two caves,
the purposes and contributions of which are listed below.
Higgenbotham #1 - Exploration - saw good portion of cave,
Higgenbotham #1 - Exploration - stopped at drop due
to dangerous rock and breakdown,
Higgenbotham #1 - Blasting trip - to remove breakdown
hazzard - unsuccessful.
Higgenbotham ii 2 - Exploration, on which we were able to
reach the stream passage and probably
lowest level of cave; over 300 feet
below the entrance. Many pits and
leads left unexplored.
Higgenbotham + 1 - Surveying trip. Mapped from the
bottom of the 140 into the cave;
1500 feet,
Higgenbotham #1 - Survey trip. Picked up where we left
off last time and mapped an addition-
al 1800 feet, with plenty of big
leads and all small leads still left
unsurveyed.
Since the 140 foot drop and also 3300 feet of sometimes
difficult passage must be traversed to reach the beginning
of the unmapped section, it would seem that the most
desirable surveying party would now be one which would
have a base camp deep within the cave and would live in
the cave for a few days, (Anyone interested, say over
next Thanksgiving.)
When a survey of #1 is completed we will run a line be-
tween the entrances of the two caves, noting the locations
