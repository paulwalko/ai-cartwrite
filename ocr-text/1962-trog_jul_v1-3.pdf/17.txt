welcome addition to my reading list, and I hope soon to be
able to offer some kind oá»˜ translation for those who may be
desirous of widening Cheir knowledge of caves to include an
acquaintance with our Austrian counterparts,
"We learned from the DC Speleograph V01.18, No. 5 about
the paper "The Tech Troglodyte" issued by you. As we
would be very much interested in receiving this pub-
lication regularly we would like to establish with you
an exchange of speleological literature offering you for
equivalent our "Die Hohle" appearing quarterly and en-
joying great popularity in the German speaking countries.
"Icoking forward to taking up a brisk exchange of liter-
ature with you we remain
Yours very truly

SLIDE SHOW SUCCESSFUL
by Grege Marland
Among the talks presented at the recent N..S. Convention
in Custer, S. Dakota, was a slide series presented by myself
as a preview of the Convention to be held at Mountain Lake
in Giles County during June of next year. The slides were
taken by various members of the Grotto; Larry Griffin, Jim
Saunders, Bob Ralph, Bobbie Stephenson, and Ed Bauer and
merely collected by myself for presentation at that time,
The forty-some slides blended together for a very interesting
and representative picture of what can be expected by those
planning to attend the convention here.
Since the convention the slides have been shown iby the
Central Indianna Grotto and the possibility of copying
them to donate for a year's use of the N.S.S. visual aido
committee has been considered. In this case a descriptive
dialogue would have to be assembled. It is believed that
it would make an enjoyable program for che various grottoes
during the next year, and would probably encourage partici-
pation in the 1963 convention. This is a matter to be con-
sidered by the club when it reorganizes in September.
The purpose of this article is to recognize and thank those
individuals for the free and unselfish loan of their
photographic bests, They have been seen and enjoyed by
many; also it is hoped that the success of this program will
encourage the club toward the completion of a slide series
on conservation which it has voted to undertake.
