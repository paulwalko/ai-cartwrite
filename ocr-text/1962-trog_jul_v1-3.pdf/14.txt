BUTLER'S AND WARM RIVER CAVES.
by Ed Bauer
on a chilly April 14, Ed Day, Gary McCutchen, Bill Lipscomb,
Jim Charlton, and I piled into Jimmie's car and headed
north for two of Virginia's best caves. Chris Schiek, Tom
Bell, John Eads and Dave Culler were going to meet us in
Williamsville, as was Grece Marland who had to make an
important purchase in Staunton. (Congratulations to Grege
and Bonnie who are now engaged.)
After several stops for picture taking along the route, we
arrived in the area of Warm River Cave. This cave is located
high on the mountain between Covington and Hot Springs on
Route 220 in Alleghany County. We parked the car at an
abandoned farm, got our gear together, and headed for the
cave. At the base of a hill is a large resurgance of fairly
warm water which is also the sight of what was once the
world's largest watercress farm. Not having any vinegar
with us, we decided to pass up this treat and headed for the
cave, which is located still another 180 feet in elevation
up the side of the hill.
The entrance is at the bottom of a small sinkhole and about
30 feet of rope is needed to negotiate the almost vertical
walls. After safely reaching the bottom of the sink, our
party hunted around for a while and finally managed to find
its way through much breakdown until we reached the top of
a short drop. Here we rigged a rope and descended. From here
we crawled and slid through breakdown until we quite
evidently were immediately above a good bit of water. At
first we had quite a problem reaching the water level and
could find no way down short of jumping, so, just as we ran
out of possible ways to go, I solved the problem by falling
backwards into the wet abyss. Not being hurt, I directed
the othors down by a now obvious route and we proceeded up-
stream waist deep in the chilly water,
