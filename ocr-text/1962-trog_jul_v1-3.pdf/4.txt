and depths of the sinkholes between the two. It is easy
to see that the complete survey of 42 will also take many
trips, but I don't relish the idea of a base camp in this
very dangerous (due to flooding) cave.
While much work is still to be done, we have already
learned much from our trips and experiences and are able
to follow our progress while drawing in the map and writing
up notes. These caves promise to be two of Virginia's
deepest and i≈ø linked together, one of its longest.
(EDITOR'S NOTE; Since this article was written it has been
learned that Ed will not be with us during the coming year,
due to accademic difficulties. It is hoped that the work
he has initiated as first chairman of the club's Project &
Program Committee will be continued.)
TRIP REPORT:
HIGGENBOTHAM #1

The most recent trip to Higgenbotham #1 in Tazewell County,
Virginia for the purpose of doing additional surveying,
turned out to be one of the most eventful trips in which I
have ever participated. Leaving school on a Saturday after-

If you have ever ridden with the two Eds while they are
taking turns driving to see who can drift through the turns

over-drifted. It seems the corner was too steep and some
fool had put some loose gravel in the street and some other
fool (bless his soul) had put up some guard rails along the
edge of the road, at the top of the cliff leading down to
the creek below. In any event, we packed the chrome neatly
into the back seat and drove screeching down the street with
both front wheels pointing out, and about 20 degrees off of
parallel. Luckily after only a few miles we arrived in the
thriving metropolis of Tazewell, Virginia, and were able to
locate an open garage, Unwilling to take a personal check,
the attendant was given 12 of our combined total of 13-3/4
dollars, Hungarly we headed for a nearby restaurant, ate
