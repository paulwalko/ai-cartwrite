After passing through length of subway tunnels, a single
donepit, under the natural bridge, and up through the
tremendous accumulations of damp, still odiferous guano
which covers a steep slope up to knee deep and makes the
ascent most interesting, we began checking the several
small holes which marked the termination of our original
survey. In one ridiculously small and tortuous squirm-way
I lost most of my shirt but fell through into a passage
even larger than that we had just left. Running in both
directions we surveyed through 40 foot wide, 40 foot high
passage into a meandering stream passage and eventually back
into our original survey at an obscure hole near the
natural bridge. Returning in the opposite direction down
passages of similar dimensions, with three survey shots in
access of 100 feet, and several very promisine side passages,
we finally abandoned the project for the time being, while
still in passage 10' by 30' :::..., with 1800 feet of survey
notes and a long and arduous trip out awaiting.
Arriving at the bottom of the drop, after considerable
grunting and groaning (especially by Ed Day), and
approximately eleyen hours after descending, I proceded
to prussik out in a fairly respectable 13 or so minutes.
I then rigged a ladder for the others, but the ladder
turned out to be twenty feet too short, Laboring under
the now-admitted misconception that a ladder climb is easier,
they prussiked to the bottom of the ladder and then climbed
up, to crawl exhausted over the lip some minutes later,
Packing our gear, we now turned to the easy little 15 foot
drop and the daylight somewhere above,
It was now nearly 7 A.M. and we had been on the go since
that time the previous day, including four hours of classes,
and three of travel before entering the cave, and it was
just too much for us. If you've ever tried to climb hand
over hand on a vertical flowstone wall on a rubberband
(1201 of nylon stretched out above) you can understand
our problem. After two trials apiece and considerable
banging around with the stretch and pull of the rope, we
became determined not to give in to the obviously simple
solution and prussik up that rotten little wall. Instead
we set our inventive genius to work for a way to
conquer the wall without submitting to prussiks. Reaching
as high as possible, we tied a butterfly knot in the rope
and Bauer pulled himself up until he was standing in the
butterfly and now stretched nearly half way to the floor.
I then added my weight and stretched the rope until we were
both on the floor, By now we had taken in nearly ten feet
of stretch, So I tied a single prussik as high as I could
get into and stood up in it. When Bauer let go of the end
