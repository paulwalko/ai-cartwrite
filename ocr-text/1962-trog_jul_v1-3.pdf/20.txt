THE TECH TROGLODYTE, Vol. I, No. 3

Before attending the Baltimore Grotto meeting, I called and
offered to present our slide show on Mountain Lake, but
when I got there I found that no one had thought to bring
a slide projector, At the meeting I sat between a baby
whale and a tarantula. Laugh if you want, but the meeting
was held in the Baltimore 700, sitting three abreast in
the aisle between the skeleton of a baby blue whale and a
showcase of mounted wildlife. (I thought I cught to give
a full explanation as my sister might not like being called
a baby whale, and I'm sure Bonnie wouldn't think much of
beine referred to as a tarantula,
LOCKIIG FCE CAVING TRIPS?
Since most oh our cave trips are spur-of-the-moment affairs,
it is impossible to suggest a schedule of trips for those
interested. However, we might remind members of the old
Timer's Reunion in Franklin, West Virginia over Labor Day
weekend. 13 also understand that Ed Bauer will be in the
Tilliamsville area, probably camping out at the Gravel Pile,
over that same weekend. For trips originating in the
Northern Virginia area, contact Bonnie Stephenson or Ed
Day. Bill Grenoble is supposed to be at Blacksburg for
the second semester of summer school for trips in that area.
Duming registration time, or the first week of school,
watch the bulletin board in the S.A.B. or come by room
108 Barringer. Good caving.
ASSORTED NOTES ON TWC SHORT TRIPS TC MARYLAND AND

a wooden ladder a short distance from the southern entrance
at a 15 foot climb, is no longer there. The ladder was com-
pletely rotten, the main support was split, and when one
runs gave way beneath my weight, the entire ladder was
doclared unsafe and totally destroyed to discourage those
who might be tomped to"risk ic". The climb is very
difficult without the ladder and we spent 45 minutes,
finally resorting to a butterfly knot ladder, making the
ascent. It is suggested that covers visiting the cave enter
by the other entrance, which is 220 feet to the northwest.
2. Twige's Cave, the largest cave in iva ryland, is at least
temporarily closed. The owner has been informed by his
lawyer that he is responsible for accidents which might
occur in his care, and we were unable to convince him to
