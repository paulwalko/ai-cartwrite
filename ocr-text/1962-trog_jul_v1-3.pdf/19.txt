additions to our "Black List" are to be noted. It is hoped
that the policy of calling to public attention the incidents
of vandalism that can be directly attributed to individuals
will increase an awareness of the need for the elimination of
these practices, and will encourago people to remove their
own and other names where possible. The ultimate goal would be,
of course, the restoration of all caves to as near as
possible their natural state and the olimination of future
acts of vandalism.

ATTEND YOUR LOCAL GROTTO MEETINGS
This may seem like a late date to offer this suggestion, but
it is hoped that our members who are at home for the summer
months will take advantage of the opportunity to attend,
where possible, meetings of local erottoes. It is not
difficult to obtain the address of the nearest grotto and
hence the meeting time and place. Two months still remain
and offer opportunities to get in on interesting programs or
just get an interesting view of what the rest of the world is
doing and how we stack up.
Since many of our members live in the Washington arca, I shall
add that the D.C. Grotto meets the first Tuesday of each
month, 3:00 P. ill., in the Georgetown Library.
Last month I took the time to attend the D.C. Grotto meeting
and heard an excellent talk on the "Mohole Project", given by
one of its officials and accompanied by a movie and a ba salt
drill core brought up from over 550 feet beneath the ocean
bottom. The object of the project is to drill through the
earth's crust at one of its thinnest spots (it is as thin as
3 to 4 miles at some points on the ocean's floor). The pro-
blems of keeping the drilling rig steady in the open ocean,
and drilling many thougands of feet beneath ocean floor were
discussed.
While attending this meeting and the July meeting of the
Baltimore Grott, I was impressed with the organization,
order, and group participation which are found at our
meetings. I was very pleased to find that our meetings com-
pared so favorably with those of other groups. With an
increase in the number of programs, our meetings would be
second to none I have witnessed.
