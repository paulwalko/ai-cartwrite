This cave is entirely filled with breakdown and following a
stream passage becomes quite a chore. Searching for the
much publicized "warm river" we eventually found a small
crack from which warm water was flowing. The Orack was too
small to permit entrance, So we searched around for a while
and finally found a way past the wall and into the warmer
river passage, I would like to say here that I don't think
that the passage we were about to enter is the warm river from
which the cave gets its name. It was never so warm that we
didn't feel like moving on and breathing never became difficult
as many stories indicate should have happened in this passage.
The water temperature was definitely not 89 degrees F. as is
also often publicized,
After locating this warmer river, we swam, crawled, and floated
upstream for probably close to 900 to 1000 feet. Several times
it was necessary to duok under low ledges and once complete sub-
mersion was necessary to proceed. After reaching a room filled
with pretty rimstone dykes we re-carbided, and swam on,
Finally we agreed that it was getting late and our carbide
supply was getting low, so we reluctantly turned around, (The
passage continued on in tunnel like fashion with perhaps 9 inches
of clearance between the water level and ceiling ) As we re-
traced our steps we noticed quite often tube like passages which
seemed to lead almost straight up from the water passage and
were definitely worth checking the next time,
Emerging from the cave completely soaked, we quickly donned dry
clothes and struck out for Williamsville. After making a
short milk stop at a small grocery store and learning from the
proprietor that the "whole mountain is hollow" we eventually
reached Bob Roller's house on the Bull pasture River in Williams-
ville and met the rest of our party.
The next morning we rose bright and early (about 9:00 A.M.)
and after a large breakfast we decided to go back to sleep.
Oscar Estes had other ideas, however, and before long we were
at the entrance of nearby Butler's Cave,
After unlocking the single chain which effectively keeps
cavers from entering the 9"x18"' entrance to Virginia's largest
cave, we rappeled down some 30 feet, slithered through mud
and the infamous "Glop Slot" and eventually worked our way
to large size passage. Here we broke up into two groups; an
exploration group and a photography group.
Our exploration group continued on back into the cave until
we were far into what is known as crystal passage. Here
&ypsum crystals cover the walls, floor and ceiling and tiny
needles can be found on close inspection. Aside from the
speleothems and size of the rooms, one of Butler's greatest
beauties lies in the fact that very little spent carbide and no
