the contrary. He was also provoked because many people who
were denied permission were sheaking in anyhow,
3. At least two Maryland caves have yielded troglo bitic
organisms. Both Boonesboro Crystal Grottoes and John
Friend's Cave yielded troelobitic specimens, as did Moler's
Cave, Jefferson County,W, Va. Those collected in Crystal
Grottoes are believed to be the first found in a Maryland
Cave, Millipedos, isopods, and an amphipod were located in
Molers; milli pedes and a spider in Crystal Grottoes; and
isopods and springtails in John Friend's, Watch forthcoming
issues of the D. C. Speleograph for an identification of
these organisms.
4. Since banging his head on a stalactite in Crystal
Grottoes, Maryland's only commercial cave, John Holsinger
could bear a little watching. After setting the entire
cave reverbrating with the blow, John energed from the cave
and walked directly into the ladies rest room (luckily for
him it was uninhabitated.)
COMMERCIAL CAVE OWNERS HAVE VANDALISM PROBLEMS
by Grege Marland
While pouring over the evening paper the other night I came
across an article entitled "Found Fortune in Caves", Hal
Boyle's syndicated column discussed the problems encountered
by Harry ilyero and Bill Vananda in commercializing Tuckaleechee
Cavern's, Tennessee, and the subsequent successes they have
had. The article quoted Mr Myers answer to the question, .
"what is the biggest headache of a commercial cave proprietor?"
and I felt that it was worth repeating.
"It's that one out of every 150 visitors - and usually it's
an adult, not a teenager - who wants to break off one of the
rock formations for a souvenir.
"Water has to drip 100 years to make a single inch of
stalagmite. It may take nature 10,000 years to form just one
small crystal spire - and then some joker comes alone and
breaks it in a second.
"And when he gets it above the ground, what does he have?
Just a piece of worthless stone. It has no meaning except
in the cave where it grew."
That reminds me, also, of the comment of our guide on a
recent trip to Boonesboro Crystal Grottoes, Maryland, who
stated, "If they can't break it off, they write on it."
