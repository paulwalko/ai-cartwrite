wanting to learn from experience, we beat a hasty retreat
to the surface. Tired but never too tired to restrain
comment on Ed's driving, we arrived back at Tech at
about 11:00 P.M.
GIAIT CAVE
by Ed Day
A group of six of us went to Giant Cave on Saturday after-
noon, April 21st. The party consisted of Tom Lamons,
Zeke Fuller, Gary McCutchen, Byron McCutchen, a friend
of Zeke's by the name of Kermit, and myself. The cave
is just outside of Narrows, Virginia
The entrance is in a small, but deep sink, dropping a
total of 100 feet. The first 60' is a rather easy climb,
but most people prefer to rappel. The rest of the drop
is steeper, ending in about 15' of free space, We rigged
a cable ladder on this last part. The free seotion was
oluttered with logs in an improvised ladder, which we
judged unsafe and removed.
Once inside, exploration of the cave is simple. It
consists mostly of two large rooms. The cave abounds in
speleothems of every type and is quite impressive, though
sections are badly vandalized. As a project, this club
intends to clean it up somewhat, Giant was commercial back
in the '30's and must have been quite a sight. Now the
old commercial entrance is filled in and most of the
wooden walkways are disintegrated into humus,
We left the cave at dark and returned to find my car sur-
rounded by cows. We managed to chase them and got our-
selves out of there. We subsequently learned that the
farmer had had to pen his bull to keep him from attacking
the bright yellow convertible,
LINK'S CAVE
by Ed Day
Link's, a very small cave near Newport is one of the most
photogenio caves in this area. Its passage is measured
in hundreds of feet and it can be thoroughly examined
without refueling your lamp, but the cave is literally
packed with formations and it is a favorite subject of
Techmen's cameras.
On Thursday afternoon, May 5, Pete Stoller and Pat O'Meara
asked me to go to Link's with them and to bring my rope.
I thought they were crazy for this cave is about as
