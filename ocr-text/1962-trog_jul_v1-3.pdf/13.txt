The next day we went to cheok Carter Cave on the East Stone
Gap quadrangle. The owner was not at home, but we found the
cave easily and descended the pit-like entrance, from where
the cave descended rapidly into a large lake. A big spring
emerges just a short distance away, Leaving the cave we
started back across the one-man, log, foot bridge which
separates the house from the highway. I went first and while
right at midstream, the bridge neatly parted and I plunged in-
to the water about five feet below. The others were able to
cross okay Ã¾y climbing on the debris, and we left the farmer a
very apologetic note and my address, should he want some re-
muneration. (He apparently hasn't.)
Heading for Field's Cave, likewise on the East Stone Gap quad,
we started the two mile hike up what seemed to be a 50% grade,
A little over halfway, Kitty decided it couldn't be worth it
and sat down in the grass to soak up a little sun. The cave has
a large entrance but dips steeply along the bedding plane, until
it rapidly becomes filled with clay. The single passage con-
tains two concrete water basins along its 400 foot length, from
which the local people draw their water during the dry seasons.
The cave drains a large area, and in spite of its volume, pro-
bably is subjected to periodic flooding.
On our final day we went to check an area known as "The Sinks".
A local resident told us "Hits just like the surface hof the
moon." We found quite a few respectable sized sinkholes but
the only cave was Blowing Cave, Stickleyville Quadrangle
SE 3/8/7. The known length of the cave was very small in spite
of the fact that Zeke somebody-or-other had gone into it and
come out way over yonder. We did, however, find approximately
650 feet of virgin cave. It is one of those places that you
can understand why it was virgin, and are tempted to wish it
still was. It is reached by a small 20 foot pit, which is lined
on all sides by cave coral (affectionately known out West as
popcorn) and then a tight squeeze through the same stuff. I
sacrificed a shirt for this one. Beyond this however it was an
obviously virgin dirt bottomed, fairly well adorned passage
which contained among other things, a salamander laryae.
We took time to map this one, as it will probably be one of the
biggest caves in Scott County (1,000 feet.)
We went down to enjoy the wild night life of "Gat City" before
spending a good night at a girl scout camp (the girls weren't
there) and heading home. Stopping one time for directions, we
inquired as to the distance and were told by our informer "Hit
hain't fur hif you folla the road."
An additional discussion of the karst areas visited, the caves
visited (including brief descriptions and complete locations)
and the findings of note can be found in the May issue of the
Dece Speleograph.
