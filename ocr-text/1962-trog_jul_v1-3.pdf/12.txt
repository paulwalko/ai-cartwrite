MORE WORK IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA
by Gregg Marland
Over Easter weekend, that sure seems like a long time ago,
but this is the first occasion I have had to report the
findings of this amazing venture into the unknown; John
"Karst" Holsinger, Kitty Flick, Bonnie Stephenson, and
my self headed down into the wilds of Scott county to
search for new caves, collect biological specimens,
and to check out two very promising Karst areas.
Rock House cave at Banners Corner, Russell County, was
the first stop for the weekend. This cave lies directly
under the county high school and a few nearby homes, all
of which have septic tanks. There is a stream in the
caye, the level of which fluctuates as the people above
wash the dishes or flush the toilet. The walls are
stained with waste and an analysis of a water sample
taken at Thanksgiving shows an alarming degree of
pollution. The cave really shoots the theory of how
sewage, etc. are harmful tocave fauna for the walls of
the cave are literally crawling with isopods and
planarians and in the stream we found several of the
purple Salamander Gyrinophilus porphyriticus porphyriticus
which are nearly 8 inches long, and as fat as I have
ever seen, John spent considerable time and effort
photographing the specimens and their habitat, and then
went to change the film in his camera. The look on his
face when he opened the camera and realized, as the roll
of film uncoiled in the light of our carbide lamps, that
he had forgotten to reroll it into the can would be
impossible to describe. Having heard that planarians
devour isopods, We collected four of each in a small
container of their familiarly polluted water and set
them aside for several hours. We were quite surprised to
find, only a short time later, that the vial contained
only the four isopods, the planarians having furnished the
meal.

We then continued south to a high upland plateau,
primarily of carbonate rocks, and with two major springs
at its base. Four caves were located but the water table
was so high that we were unable to penetrate for any
distance in the only two that showed promise. A crayfish
was noted in one, and it got a good pinch hold on
Holsinger before escaping into the darkness,
Looking for a place to spend the night, we got our first
taste of the local dialect. "Hits okay to sleep cheer
hif you make shet of the gat after you're hin," We
finally translated that to mean that we could sleep in
his field if we closed the gate behind us.
