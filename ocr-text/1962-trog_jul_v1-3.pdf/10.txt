horizontal as you can get. I was even more skeptical when
they said they were going to check a virgin leadi We went
about halfway to the back of the cave, and started up a
chimney. From the top of the chimney we continued up in a
passage that was obviously quite well traveled. It ended
in a small room with two high leads and a low one. One of
the high leads was above a flowstone wall and we saw it
wouldn't be easy to reach. On a hunch, Pete took a shovel
to the wall and the thin flowstone broke, exposing a hard
mud underneath. He proceeded to cut footholds and handholds,
After a few minutes he turned it over to me, When I reached
the top of the wall the lead was virgin sure enough, but went
only six feet, I crawled in as far as I could and started
digging out the floor. Before long, I was able to squeeze
through into a tiny room full of soda straws, That is the
last time I'll have doubts about virgin passage even in a
well explored cave like Link's.
EDITORIAL:
A suggestion has been received from Jim Hixson of the Nittany
Grotto concerning the subscription rates of this publication,
which seems worthy of consideration, and is therefore offered
here for the consideration and comment of Grotto members and
subscribers. The problem arises from the fact that we can
never be sure how many issues will appear during a year or
how thick those issues will be. At present it appears that
we will be able to maintain our originally planned quarterly
publication rate, but it is still uncertain as to the thick-
nesses, which have already exceeded expectations, and it seems
certain that we will suffer a loss this year and find it
necessary to increase the subscription rates next January.
Mr. Hixson writes, "Here at Nittany we have much the same pro-
blem as you. We don't really know how many issues will come
out each year or how thick they will be. It all depends on
the editors, members, etc. What we do is to collect any
amount from subscribers that they want to send in and then
charge them 1-1/4¢ per page of newsletter they get." He con-
tinues to explain that the cost of each issue is subtracted
from the ballance until such time that the ball ance falls below
25€. At this time a notice is sent with the current issue
that the ballance has fallen below the minimum amount,
This seems like a very practical suggestion and is presented
here for the comments of our readers.
