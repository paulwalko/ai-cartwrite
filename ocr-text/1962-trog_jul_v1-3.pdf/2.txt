members, their willingness to support it financially and to
submit their trips, discoveries, observations, ideas for
comedy, or just plain cave gossip. Contributors, typists,
mimeographers, and people with a few minutes a week to con-
tribute are needed to make this a worthwhile and interesting
newsletter,
Always important, should be the quest for the unknown and
the study of the partially known. In our area, are unmapped
caves to be surveyed, unusual geologic features to be noted,
unknown passages to be explored, cave fauna to be studied,
and caves yet to be seen at all. Continued growth in
enthusiasm, curiosity, and willingness to do a little hard
work should account for major advances in all of these fields
during the coming year,
Looking back again, it seems appropriate to mention the names
of five individuals who made major contributions to our club
during their sojourn here, but are leaving shoes to be filled
in the coming year; Ed Bauer, Larry Griffin, Sam Dunaway, Bob
Ralph and Bill Haile, Bauer should be back in September,
1963, and in the meantime, our loss is a real gain for the
Northern Jew Jersey Grotto.
ENTHUSIASMI CURIOSITYI HARD WORK! These we will need.
PROGRESS REPORT: HIGGENBOTHAM CAVES PROJECT
by Ed Bauer
For many of those who are not familiar with this club
project, first let me explain the purpose and nature of the
project, second a brief description of the cave, and third let
me explain what we have done there and plan to do in the future.
With the formation of the Project Committee last year, I was
ma de committee chairman and sought a worthwhile project
for our club. It would seem that some of our members were
tired of just going "cavin'" every weekend and actually wished
to do something constructive. A project we (the committee)
felt would give individuals the opportunity to learn different
a species o√é caving; mapping; rigging; and biological, geological
and hydrological studies. It is our intention to first map
completely both caves and at the same time study their
hydrology, geology and biology. Since the two caves are
located so close together, we would like to find out if they
are or could be connected and if not, why not,
