our fill, and then attacked the bill, Confronted with
a choice of a personal check or three new dishwashers,
the owner finally gocepted the check - the only one
amongst us.
We arrived at the cave a short time later, and after
ascending the steep climb to the entrance rigged the
140 foot drop. It is interesting to note that because the
drop is about 150 feet inside of the cave, and there is
no place to rig the rope inside of the cave, we generally
tie in to a large rock forma tion at the entrance. The
rope then runs 130 feet down a 25 degree slope, drops
vertically for 15 feet, runs horizontally for 20 feet,
and then plunges 140 feet to the main level of the cave.
We tied a nylon rope at the entrance, ran it down over
the short drop which we descended via a French Rappel,
and planned to ascend hand-over-hand (remember this idle
boast later on), and ran it through an expansion bolt
placed in the wall to eliminate rubbing of the rope and
make the break-over easier. Just below the bolt we tied
it to the manilla rope on which we would descend. The
drop is free space all of the way except for one sloping
ledge, too small to stand on, which juts out slightly.
For the last half of the descent you are close enough to
the wall that it can be used to prevent spinning, and also
close enough to place you in the waterfall that is like-
wise descending. This is no problem when both are
descending, but when you start up, the wet rope and icy
water are not generally spoken of in kind terms.

Below the drop the cave continues as a very narrow,
winding fissure type passage with one moderate sized room
containing a waterfall, two short rappels, and two very
interesting little climbs. After nearly 400 feet a big
"T" intersection is reached, and so much cave has been
found to the left, I have yet to even enter the right
hand passage beyond the first room. This room contained
many dead bats, the three freshest of which we collected.
Their ultimate fate since being removed from the cave
for an autopsy I do not know,
Heading to the left into big passage we took time off at
several points to climb upon ledges and jump into the
soft knee-deep bat guano, One of the amazing features
of this cave is the vast amount of guano, much of it
still in a damp, fresh condition, and the small number
of bats that have been actually noted to date.
