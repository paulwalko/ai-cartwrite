THE TECH TROGLODYT I
1971
SURVEY II
This survev proved, without a doubt, that cavers
are individuals. Of the 30 some surveys turned in, 15
different curriculuns were listed, Biolocy c.lained more
peole.'than any other curriculum, with close seconds in
Geology and Forestry. In general, all inajors were science
oriented excent for one. lone soul over in Home Ec,
About a third of the peole had switched curriculums at
least once, and a sixth syitched twice. It's interest-
ing to note that all but tro of the six graduate students
have been in the saine curriculum all along,
These same graduate students understandably lead in
the QCA derartment, The lowest QCA's centered on the
sonho nores and juniors, but cach class hac its share.
There were an ecual nunber recorded in each of the six
arbitrary classes (:2,0; 2,0-2.4; 2,4-2,7; 2,7-3,0;
3,0-3,5;>3,5) with the exception of the the 3.5 and above
vh i.ch claimed three. It's also interesting that tivo of
our cronouts had 3,2 and 2.8 CA's when they left.
Caving frequency for over 50% of the people vas
once a week, Twice a month was the next most popular
category, and a few claimed "less". Two of the "less"
were also the two dropouts with good QCA's who are now
Working as Stock Clerk and Construction Laborer This
must ncan something, but I hesitate to say exactly what.
The average caver was 20-22 years old with a range
of 17-32 years. There were 30% girls who turned in
surveys, and two more juniors than seniors or sophomores.
Most neo"le started caving when they became associated
with VPI, though there were a few who spent 4-5 years
elsewhere and one who sent 12 (wonder who that could be!)
Over half live in the dorms at resont, and the rest are
in apartments or houses. There are also three trailer-ors,
Nine 700316 claim being inarried (4 coules?) and five
are engager (maybe someone doesn't know something).
There are few who aren't dating steadily and only one
child is reported. All but one person who is engaged
or jarried has a caver-type "spouse".
The courses liked and dislike showed as much vari-
ation as the curriculums, Geolocy was slightly ahead as
the most ilked courses, followed closely by Biology,
English, Computer Science, and liath. The dislike showed
a very heavy concentration on English and Hath. There are
700le you really wonder about though. Such as the ones
whose favorite courses included Explosives and Butchering!?
