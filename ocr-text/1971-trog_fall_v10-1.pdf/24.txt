THE TI'CH TROGLODYTT

dripped from the center of the ceiling, and the stream
flowed from a hole in the side of the rooin. The floor,
slanting uward, was covered with boulders and loose rocks,
Noticing a.rocess high up on the wall, I started to climb ·
up to it, but the walls began to crumble under my weight,
Quickly leaving the unstable room, we continuod up what.
ancared to be the main passage.
l'loving ahead around a bond', Larry entered a divided
crowl before I saw the course' he took, calling to hiin, I.
ontered the hole from villich his voice cinerged; Procoeding
down the: cravil, all that I found was barren rock surrounding
me, I yelled but ther was no answer. Larry was nowhere
around me, Quickly backtracking, I 'cntered the other hole
and soon camo ugon something sliding ahead of nic, namely
Larry,
. All at once, the massage become very "stoor as vo climbed
ů? loose dirt, uy through another hole to a little open
eroa that advanced ühard to a ceiling of what appeared to
be a rocl: and dirt fill, with treo or shrubbery roots twining
cround it. This parently was the end of the passage
perhaus vory close to the surface..
Rotracing our steps downstream to the crossroads at
the mud slopes, we found that the passageway to the left
of the junction descended quite visnbly, 25 the ceiling
started closing in. A cravilway was soon upon us again?,
this time with a stroom. The end was not in sight, but
thc crawl seemed to be getting smaller. Because of the
lateness of the hour, we decided to return to the surface,
leaving a nunber of leads unchecked.
Perha is because we were disanointed in the trend the
now .ssege had talécil, cold and fatigue seemed to weig2
more heavily uron us, . As we began our way back through
the cravils, Larry's arns began to hurt and he found that
he could not move them. He lay flat on the cravilway floor
having lost his strength, However, a short rost helped
restore some of his lost strength and we soon were slowly
moving on our way to thc surface, Much later, we crawled
out the entrance holo,
· The cave had taken much out of us. Larry decided that
he never wants to return to the hardships of Zitt Cave
again. But I have a strange fooling that one day we will
roturn to the Pulaski netherworld to further unravel the :
mysteries of Zitt Cave. Who knows? Perhaps we will take
a part in the linking together or a vast Pulaski cave
system.
