Quite tired, we returnod to the others with a glowing report
oľ our ner discoveries.
many months assed before we decided to return to
Zitt, the "killer cave", as Larry called it because of
its cxhausting crawlways. One chill November day, we found
ourselves passing once more through the zig-zag z-like
entrance channel of Mr. Ferrell's cave, as Larry and I had
decided to na' tlic nor! section, ?c had chosen another
rather thinly built :crson to help us. Our istake was
that wo had chosen a novice, and soon the confining dismal
passages started to affect him. His spirits sinking, ho

With every bit of strength loſt in his body and with
our assistance, 10 forced his yay back out the cravil and
soon to the outside world. Once outside, his recovery was

rigours of such a maced and confining cave environment.
It was not nuch more than a vicek later when Bob Lewis
took Larry and myself becli to mao Zitt's new section.
Bob and a fellow caver loft us in Zitt while they went to
