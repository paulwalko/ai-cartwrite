A LOOK AT
THE FREER SIDE OF LIFE...
What? A liberated caver? No, that doesn't mean one
who has finally escaped from the bottom of Spence or
from under a pile of guano, Nor is it a caver who just
succeeded in flunking out. In fact it applies to only
one group of cavers - the wonen.
Ah yes, the question today as you dress for another
trip, "Should I or shouldn't I harness myself into that
useless piece of caving gear?" Let's evaluate the facts
first.
Well, there's no apparent disadvantages to rapelling
with a bra, in fact it night even be a burn preventitive.
when the rope gets tangled. But once in the cave, there
are definite advantages of being able to manuver freely,
You know those crawlways with strange fornations
shooting up from the floor? Wouldn't it be nice to glide
over them as easily as the guys do? It is possible if
your body is left free to go its natural way.
And what about those places that are only six inches
wide,,,a forried 36 or 42 just won't cake it, Are you ..
beginning to see the picture?
Strean passages can really have bad effects also,
Caving with a cold wet cinch never proved too pleasant,
especially when water keeps sloshing out of its resevoir
when ever you make a big novenent like taking a step,
Kinda bad, huh?
And ever have to pull down that superfluous
equipment when it pops up to your neck while you're
reaching for that next handhold? Rather difficut
through a denin jacket, two shirts and a t-shirt, right?
And then going back up the rope - why do you need two
chest safetys? Especially when one isn't doing you any
favors? Liberated, you could wear the other safety under
your arripits and not be so tired upon reaching the top.
Now do you get the picture? Hang loose of Mother
Nature's apron strings and start caving like you were
built for it!
