FALL
THE TECII TROGLODYTE_
1971
ON SPEED TRAPS
Cavers have long held the conviction that the most :
dangerous art of caving is getting to and from the cave.
In view of this, below are a few.yords from The Washing
ton Post: July 23, 1971 on speed traos in Virginia and
the some a joining states,
· Ludowici,Géorgia. This backwater town on U,S.
301 is little more than a crossroads, but it is known
for the most infamous speed traps in the country.
Forner Georgia Gov, Lester liaddox himself labeled
the local officals !!corrunt" and erected billboard's
warning travelers of speed trays and clin joints..
Iudovici's bag of gimmicks. has, even included tricl
lights, Ticketing has leveled off in the two months
since the local political boss died, but notorists
are still reporting arbitrary arrests. :::
Southern Virginia, U.S. 301 south of Petersburg
has long been recarded by experienced travelers as
a road to avoid, For example, speed limits change
abruptly where Interstate 95 merges with route 301.
And if you blind your eyes, you'll miss the town of
Stony Creek, 20:ulation 437. Although the town is. -
off route 301, it's corporate limits" extend across
this highway and the speed limit is arbitrarily
reduced, I-64 between Richmond and Williamsburg
is also incomnlete. Sneed limits change suddenly
when . Interstate I-64. nerges with old U.S. 60.':..
Radar ecuinned troopers often lie in wait in the
woods for cars that don't slow down cuite in time.
The tiny town of Glen Lyn on U.S. 460, right on the
Vest Virginia line, emoloys a vigorous local' officer
who sometimes carries a justice of the peace right
in the car with him, Other spots to avoid in Vir-
ginia include Independence on U.S. 21 and U.S. 58;
U.S. 58 between Clarksville and South Hill; and
U.S. 1 from IcKenney to the North Carolina line.
Seems Hr Anderson did a fine bit of coverage, but
he neglected to mention our old friend, the Pembroke cop.
I'm sure the town would be disapnointed that thoy didn't
make national renovin.
