1971
THE "LAST" TRIP TO PAUL PENLEY'S
According to Ed Morgan, the trip to Paul Panloy's on
October 23, 1971, was to be the conclusion to his mapping
of the cave. Ed had said that each trip of the previous
year viould be his last, but he was to find that even this
tri-, viould not end his relations with the cave, Contrary to
Ed's beliefs, it sooms that Paul's loves Ed and koos thinking
up now ways to entice his back to its dark passages,
Accompanying Ed on his momentous "last" triy were Bob
Alderson, Jim Altman, Jan Davis, Bill Douty, Karl Hamin, Liz
Leach, Nancy Vick, and myself, Robyn Le Fo'na. Karl, Nancy,
Jan, and I were to complete the mapping while Liz and Jim
were going with Ed, Bill, and Bob to checl out a dro?,
The aro begins with a tight scuooze, enc. Ed was sending
Jim and Liz through to mako sure that what he hoped vas
truc, that the drop would not lead to more cave.
We got into the cave at 12:30 ,n.which indicated
that at least we were starting our tri on schodulo, Along
with the human members of the crow, WC took two ladders
and three ropes. One ronc, which had hardly lost its virginity,
vas mino; and like most things that go to Penloy's it will
never be the seme again. We got through the cave's various
obstacles, the Shower Room, the loddor climb, the chimncy
(or the walk down and climb up if you are chicken); and
vie came to the Tyrolean traverse, which is a 30 foot rappel
crossover to a hole on the other side of a drop. lÄ«y rope
was used for the Tyrolean, so ct least I lovi I had the support
of a friend,
After crossing tho traverse, the mapping crow and the
dro? chocking crov split up, 11y group named about 300
fect which included a cramy creating crawlviay and the area
on. the far side of the Tyrolean. Liz and Jimmy were
unsuccessful in malcing Ea hanny, After chiseling away at
the rock protecting the drop while hanging from bolts set
by the super hammer of Bill Douty, they found that the dron
opened u, Ed decided that another trip would be needed
to check the nit since Liz and Jim were all Chiseled out
and the pit would havo to be survoyed anyway,
Ily groun finished marmping carly because we left sono
vet passages to be completed later when dry woather comes ,
although it never comes to Paul Penley's. While waiting
for Ed and his groun, Jan, Nancy, and I crossed back over
the traverse and bogan planning an attack on Karl's warm
body, Bill arrived over the drop before Karl, and we had
to be satisfiod with him instead.
After everyone had reached the near side of the traverse,
we finished the mapping by connecting the Tyroloan survey.
