roads! It seemed as though all the crawls we had come
through were nothing but drainago tunnels leading to this
big mother cave, as Larry said,
Nearly wild with excitement, Larry took off, running
downstream, I called after him, but his reply vas inaudible.
He was gono in a flash, Turning I went a little ways u19-
stream, came back, and found Larry. We both ventured upstream
and jumped up on c giant slanted cxhense of a fairly dry
mud bank Climbing steadily uwards, we reached a crack
betwoon the slope and the ceiling. Poering through, WC
gazed in 2VTO at 2 great misty corridor.
Wo wanted to explore further, but an ominous feeling
