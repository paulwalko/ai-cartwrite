THE TECH TROGLODYTE 1971 1
WHY DID YOU JOIN THE CAVE CLUB?
I think that many trainees willihnye noticed that
their answer to that recurrent question, "Why did you
join the Cave club?", (WDYJTCC?:), has changed greatly in
the past few 120.:s. At their first meeting tney may
have replied that it was something they'd like to try,
something that really sounded adventurous, After several
trips, a trainee probably replied that it was the beauty
of caves, the sport, and the friendship and reliance so
intimately related with caving. And finally, when a
trainee has acquired that coveted membership, the answer
may have sound somewhat plilosophical -- "a desire to
start a new way of liffe." I'd like to discuss what these
replies meant: at the time the question was asked, and how
and why the caving experience has changed them,
Most everyone goes to that first Cave Club meeting
anticipating something really new and exciting -- and
they usually find it. It may have been the excitenent
of a heated discussion between jumar and can men, of
laughing so hard that you cried when you heard those
trip reports, : of hearing about the feats of those who
had gone bolting, rappelling, etc. Yes, a trainee's first
reply to "WDYJTCC" was full of anticipation of adventure,
excitement, and challenge,
After several trips, a trainee's reply will change,
He will probably have seen spectacular formations and
fossils, wondered how it all came about, and really cane
to a true appreciation of Mom Nature's internal anatomy.
He will probably have marvelled at the physical dexterity
of his trip leaders -- their abilities to get through
holes inscrutably small, to scale chiuneys defyingly
tall, and to be as graceful in each calculated movement
as a highly trained athlete, And during those first trips
when the first tip blows, when that light keeps going out,
whenever the patience and encouragement of his group
leader gets him through those difficult spots on his own,
when a trainee will come to a truer meaning of friendship,
reliance, trust, And his answer to "WDYJCC?" will
reflect; these experiences.
By the time a trainee is eligible for membership, he
will have acquired a broad range of experiences. He
has probably made many new and close friencdships, and
he may have partied and gotten drunk with his fellow
cavers. He has a great repository of cating experiences-
sporting, mapping. pushing passage, participating in con-
servation trips, and perhaps even saving a follow
caver's life, Mud and the monkey, a hard-hat and un-
kempt hair have become his trademarks as he emerges
from the inner world each trip. While a sense of
