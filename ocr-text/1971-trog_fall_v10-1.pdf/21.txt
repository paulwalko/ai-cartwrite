Becausc of the extra burden of our mapping cruipent, we
had decided to leave our supply packs outside the scuee≈ºevey,
bringing with us a small container of carbide and onc of
water to maintain the carbide lamas, our solo available
light sources until our roturn to our acks,
Enduring considcrable difficulty, we surveyed the
cranned thoroughfare. At one point, I looked beside me
