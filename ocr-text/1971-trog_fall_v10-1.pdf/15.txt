THE SLIDE
On Sunday, June 20, the last day the Great 1971
NSS Convention, while all the conventioneers were home-
ward bound, tee last bits and pieces of the nemorable event
were being collectod, swent up, folded, stashed away
and returned. All 75 milk cans were piled up in the little
trailer and rattlod for the last time back to the lot
to be returned to the Dairy Science Department, The Big
Tent was folded up, the picnic tables went back to the Park
Service, and th; assorted tables and chairs were taken
back to the dining hall. As the latter were being hauled
around bacle to Dietrick, the cavers hanging on the backs
of the trailcr noticed several streams of vater flowing
down the steen hill form the new F 7 building, just
beyond the Aggie Bridge, At the time, the phenomenon got
no more then a fer assing comments,
Later that evening, back at the Carbide Dum?), an
apartment full of ischief loving cavors pondered the un-
cventful cvening,
"Hey, let's go hlay in the flood!"
"hat flood?"
"The one by the Aggie Bridge, "
"ihat are we waiting for?"
So, cuicker than the flutter of a bat's wings or a
roclo in free fall, the glo? of cavers were at the scene
of The Flood. For a few seconds they stood there in the
on coming dark, in the light of the street light, and they
gazed at the three wide and fast flowing rivers of water
coming down the steen hill, Scucals of wonder arose
when it was discovered that in addition to the rivers,
the entire hill was covered with a sheet of flowing water!
The amazement increased as they discovered several brawny
and exhausted worlomen attempting vainly to shut off the
burst water main, They stood there, in a circle, ankle
deen in rushing water, contenlating the tales of woe
of the work on v!20 had been there all afternoon, when
suddenly, a wild shreil was heard. They all turned around
in unison in time to see the form of Ed "Zoom" Richardson
dissancar down the hill in a sheet of spray,
Hesitating only to empty their pockets of worldly
possessions into the hands of the then dry spectators,
Bob "the Streak" Pago and Meal "Flash" Morris followed
in joyous rapture, Pardly to be out donc, the Ladies
Auxiliary.. contingent, consisting of Jan "Zan" Davis,
Pam "Swoosh" Mohr and Janet "Blitz" Queisser, joinec in,
in some cases involuntarily. What a zoo! What a circus!
