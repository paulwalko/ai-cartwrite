TIC TECH TROGLODYTE
1971
The combinations and variations of stunts were unlimited,
Ever been in a yrastling ratch involving a hile of bodies
rolling and sliding itself dorm a hill? TOT! How about
King of tine lountain or a wet version of Crack the Whin?
Fantastic! After some' untold length of time, the cavers
1?oticed what a good job t?ey yere doing on the hill and
in the name of soil conservation they continued tile
celebration to the Carbide Dunn. For reasons pertaining
to the literary rerutation of this publication, the
narrative ends here, but next time you drive by the noted
Sot, look carefully for the sort of worn spots telling
of the "Great Slide",
