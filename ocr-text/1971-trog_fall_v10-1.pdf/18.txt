DISCOVERY IN THE PULASKI NETHERORLD
Pulaski County, Virginia, noncland or multi-talented
super-caver, Bob Levis, is a beautiful rolling countryside,
gougod vith innumerable sinkholes. This stirring landscape
has continued to nurse the 2020 in Bob's mind of the
discovery of an extensive cave system under the Pulaski
hills. After years of searching, Bob and his friend,
Ec liorgan, have located and 1277ed a great array: 01
shall cavés, as well as one of the larger caves of
Virginia, James Cave, in the area. It has been one of
Bob's many hopeiul dreams to link together the numerous
ratch le-like Caves Cottinn, the Ferr 011's la ith near
James Cave which already has over a mile of manned passage,
Not long after I became e nombcr of the.V,P.I. Cavo
Club, Larry Cooke, mutual. iriond of Bob Lewis and myself,
invited me on a caving trio which initiated me into the
wonders of the haunting Pulaski underworld. Larry, who has
a physicve that enables him to enter Small crawlways,
wanted no to 2017 him push the tightest cravi] that he had
ever tried to enter, Away we went this cool Aril night
to Zitt Cave (Ferrell's 10), the largest of the Ferrell
caves, to push a lead that, if it lent going, was heading
in a direction directly toward James Cave. Larry had tried
to scueeze through the crawl once before, but had given
u7 without success, ;
Soon after entering the small entrance, our companions,
Jim Talmadge and Don Davison, tried out some of the small
passages and then decided to look around and wait for us
in another (larger) section of the cave. Larry and I
passed cuickly down to the lower level until we caine to
the notoriously tight Zitt crawlways. Crossing over a
sizeable rock which partially blocks the entrance of the
first crawl, we removed our side packs and nelinets ini
order to vor: our way through the largest of Zitt's tight
crawls, linutes later, wo energed into a narrow, slanted
room that contained the opening to the next cravil which
curves through solic rock and ends with a twelve foot crop.
lioving onward, we presently arrived at another tight spot,
which is a slick flat boulccr of flowstone slanted at such
an angle that when you crawl over it, gravity pulls you
down into a wedge-shaped crevice created by the rock meeting
the tilted cave ceiling,
Once over the boulder and down the other side, we saw
the tiny acrature which was our goal. Immediately, Larry
flattened out and tried to pus!) himself through it.'
Folloving a short struggle, l2c withdrow and turned to me
with the g]. ?ad of hone fading from his cycs. Thinking
that iſ Larry could not do it, nobody could; mostly for
