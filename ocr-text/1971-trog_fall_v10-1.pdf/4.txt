COMMENTARY
There has recently been in this grotto à discussion,
sometimes passive and sometimes not, of the issue of
cave mapping versus sport caving. This is not intended
to be a defense of either one or the other, but comments
on both. I've heard it said that sport cavers are largely
inconsiderate to landowners, litter up the cave, dump
carbide and generally don't give a damn, Cave mappers,
on the other hand are supposed to be the pinnacle of
consideration and purposeful endeavor, or the other way
around. To be really honest, I feel to take either extreme
is ridiculous. I've seen hordes of sightseers stumble
and bungle a cave into destruction, yet I've been also
witness to mappers deposit trash, carbide and other
garbage that does nothing for the aesthetic wonder of a
cave, Landowner relations are simply a matter of diplo-
macy, which is a skill developed regardless of whether
you cave to nap or cave for enjoyment. And as far as
purpose goes , , who is to say that people making a nap
have more of a right to be there than people who pursue
caving as a sport? The discussion can go on and on and
on,
For the science of Speleology to become a genuine
discipline, it must attain some sort of importance to the
rest of the world other than a natural curiosity.
Importance usually rates in an economic manner. .
Saltpetre mining, fertilizer production have given caves
econonic prominence. Not too distant is the expansion
of urban areas into limestone country; will this house
or highway fall in or won't it? Instead of a group of
eccentrics, cavers may become authorities in an increas-
ingly important field. It is not too far removed to thinx
of a Department of Speleology within the Department of
the Interior? (In the true sense of the word! :) Beyond
that consider the idea of Cave Management, how to utilize
and preserve the natural phenomena, What about setting
aside certain caves for people to use for recreation,
kind of like a National Park gone underground?
Protect certain natural wonders for very limited use and
access like a Wildlife Refuge. That calls not only for
people who know how to use a compass, but those versed
in the field of recreation, Think about it, it may
not be too far in the future,
But what about now? We must educate cavers, old-
tiners, potential and non, to leave the cave as much as
possible the way it was before nan ever brought light to
the dark passages. Whether you're working on a map, doing
a hydrology study, hunting for a new species or just exper-
iencing the thrill of excitement underground, the most
important thing is how you go about what you're doing.
Peaceful co-existance,
