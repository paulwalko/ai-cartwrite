FALE.
THE TECH TROGLODYTE

curiosity's sake, I lay flat and pushed my head into the
small hole, looking for any possible way to get through,
without resorting to blasting or digging. With my arms
outstretched in front of me, I inched forward. The cold
cave walls circled tight around my body. If the walls were
to come a little closer, I would not be able to breathe.
I squirmed forward a few more inches, pushing hard with
my feet, and pulling hard with all the strength in my arms.
My head pressed flat on its side against floor and ceiling:
I was in a completely uncomfortable position, as I tried
to push aside small loose rocks and debris. Suddenly,
the impossible happened. I squirmed through the hole and
around a narrow bend. The squeezeway grew larger, so that
it could soon be called a crawlway again. Unbelievingly,
Larry forced himself back into the squeeze-hole until he
thought he was stuck... "I can't move," he cried. Then,
with sheer determination, He broke through to the other
side where no humans had ever been before us. The squeezeway
had been conquered.
We moved on. A great excitement surged through us.
We were explorers of an unknown land. What dark mystery
lay before us2 The crawlway continued in the same general
direction. I felt like a mole passing through a narrow
subterranean burrow, Here and there my light gleamed on
'little white threads hanging from the ceiling: soon-to-
perish tiny plants whose seeds had germinated in the humid
cave atmosphere, but lacked the light necessary to develop
and maintain chlorophyll. It was apparent that this tunnel
passage must flood in heavy rains.
We were sensing the gradual downward trend of the
amazingly straight-line tunnel (which was now large enough
to permit walking) when abruptly the floor disappeared at
the edge of a fifteen foot drop. Climbing down, we soon
came to the edge of another eight foot drop through a small
hole. The cave was much wetter and somewhat m√ºddy here:
Passing through stoop-walking, crawling, and even some
walking passage, we crossed through a tight spot overgrown
with formations that nearly blocked our progress. Looking
up, I caught my breath. For an instant I thought I was
gazing into the gaping, giant-toothed mouth of a great
animal. I was triankful that the immense jaw was made of
calcite. We named the formations the Dragon's Teeth.
It was not long before the walls seemed to progressively
come closer and closer together as we moved further and
further down the underworld trail. Soon, the ceiling,
swooped down to a small pool of water before us. A siphon.
I ventured partly into the water and decided it was not
likely that we could continue on, even if the water was
not there. However, we could not really be sure, for
sometimes people seem to be able to do the impossible.
