June 17 I've been at this Convention for five days and
haven't seen the sun yet! Is 3d loud the one who is al-
ways laying under a pile of beer cans? - T.C. Ferret
Are there really monsters in Hountain Lele?
Ha! It is suonosed to clear un today - but that's what
they said 4 days ago, I must admit that inore likely than
not the reason for the aeluge is that I lanned a Hig ürip.

P.S. ---& new verse for the old VPI Orgy song, Rider
(dedicated to the 1971 HSS Convention)
" 07, the sun's gonna shine on our campground someday.
The sun's gonna shine on our campground someday!
And the wind from the river's gonna blow John Tich-
enor aviay! "

June 18 (we think) We think you're doing a good job at
the Convention ---- leaders competent, atient -- and it
usually rains at Conventions anyway. - NSS 5002
June 19 Some good caving around here. Went to Paxton's
today - really fine, We're eating here at this damned
restaurant thanks to 2002 prior lanning on the part of
VPI Grotto who said last weeltend that we could wait ụntil
this weelend to get ticlets to the Bancuet! Anyway, the
caves are good - thanx to Edmorgan for the good tri?,

Sorry about that, Joel. But when most everyone at Regis-
fration is hali-dead and hungover and nost of the Conven-
tioneers were half-dead and hungover, nisunderstandings
hapen, The Bancuet really wasn't worth it anyway, , nonn
Editor's note - I really encourage 200mle to stop in at
Peters and contribute to the Caver's Log, Adventures take
on a certain "ruality when they are recorded just after
they happen. Besides it's iun to look at all the levd.
