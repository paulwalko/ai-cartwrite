THE TECH TROGLODYTE
GROTTO FILES
The files of the VPI Cave Club have been over the
years, a source of information which was not commonly
available elsewhere. The files contained such things 'as
the Grotto Grapevine, the NSS News and NSS Bulletin,
cave naps and reports, along with various and sundry
other things, But through the years, certain articles
in the files have disappeared. Such items as the NSS News
and Bulletins are now very few and far between; although
recent acquisitions have increased the number of volunes
of these issues somewhat, Still the files are in need of
the older publications,
The_Grotto Grapevine, which is reported to be the .
first caying publication of its kind in the country,
is in very short supply in the files. Although pub-
lished by our grotto, there are at the present tine about
thirteen copies in the files. This is all that remains
on a total of more than forty issues which were published,
The fact that the VPI Grotto does not have a complete
set of its own newsletter is a disgrace. The same
thing is true of the other itens in the files. At
one time there were copies of most of the caving journals
and newsletters. Over the years people have checked
out these materials from the files and forgot to return
them. Also there is the possibility that some of these
publications were stolen from the files by individuals
who wanted material for their personal library. An
originial issue of the Grotto Grapevine would be a very
nice addition to a private collection as these itens are
now rather valuable.
Needless to say, some of these items, especially
those out of print, are extremely hard to acquire, I
would like to ask that anyone interested in donating,
trading or selling some of these materials, especially
the Grotto Grapevine, to the VPI Cave Club, please contact
the Club or myself at the Club's address. Any material
obtained from private persons would be greatly appre-
ciated and maybe the files can be restored to their
originial volune,
