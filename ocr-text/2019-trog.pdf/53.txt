About Wil Orndorff:
A native of the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, Wil
Orndorff drank karst water while looking for caves on
the family farm where he was raised, as well as within
and around the adjacent abandoned quarry.
Introduced to the formal caving world at the age of
18, his interest in caves, karst waters, and geology grew into both a career and a life-long
passion. With a bachelors degree from Johns Hopkins and a masters in geology from
Virginia Tech focusing on Appalachian tectonics in hand, Wil entered the professional karst
world as a self-employed consultant performing karst analyses of the potential impacts of a
proposed high voltage power line corridor on karst springs and bat habitat along its path.
These analyses included multiple dye traces in cave systems developed in the limestones of
middle Ordovician age that host many of Virginia's larger cave systems. This work gave Wil
the credentials needed to secure his dream job as a karst specialist with the state, where he
became Virginia's second karst protection coordinator when Terri Brown, his supervisor,
returned to graduate school, leaving large shoes to fill. This job became Wil's career, and
afforded him the opportunity to do the work he loved protecting the resources he cared
about. The nature of the job turned Wil into a jack of all trades karst who wears many hats:
geologist, hydrologist, conservationist, educator, explorer, and, increasingly, biologist. Wil
has had the opportunity to work with a long list of experts across this spectrum, including
among many others John Holsinger, Dave Culver, Dan Doctor, Dave Hubbard, Jim Kennedy,
Mike and Andrea Futrell, Phil and Charlotte Lucas, Chris Hobson, Roy Powers, Matt
Niemiller, Bill Balfour, Larry Smith, Rick Reynolds, Carol Zokaites, Bob Denton, Tom
Malabad, Joel Maynard, Shane Hanlon, Joey Fagan, Jerry Lewis, Madeleine Schreiber, Mike
and Katarina Ficco, Dan Fong, Karen Powers, and of course his wife and partner in crime,
Zenah. One of the most satisfying parts of his career has been seeing folks who worked with
him while in college or graduate school like Ben Schwartz and Ben Hutchins achieve great
success in the academic karst world, albeit in Texas for those two. Wil has authored or
coauthored papers on dye tracing, karst aquifer dynamics, site occupancy by stygofauna,
epikarst recharge processes, speleogenesis, conservation planning, utility corridor
evaluation, ecology of Gray bats, response of bat populations to White Nose Syndrome, and
biogeography of cave invertebrates. His work has resulted in the establishment of two
