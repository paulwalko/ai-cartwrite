The Antelope shook and pitched on her side How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs And the Main truck carried off both me legs
(Refrain)
So here I lay in my 23rd year How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now It's been 6 years since we sailed away And I just made Halifax yesterday
(Refrain)
End
Alternate lyrics: To the tune of Barrett's Privateers
God damn that crawl! I was told We'd cruise through cave for virgin leads Through big borehole, crawl no more! But I'm a broken man on a Brunton crew The last time I survey with you!
