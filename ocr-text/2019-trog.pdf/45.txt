the sweaty layer back on over top, and then put my suit back on. There’s still water in my outer layers, but it’s not enough to reach my skin or saturate my base layers. I end up staying pretty warm and dry until it’s time to move again. This approach isn’t strictly limited to warm eastern caves - it even worked pretty well for me on a few project trips in the Bob Marshall Wilderness. That’s obviously just my experience, but I think the underlying concepts can work for anyone. In summary, minimize the amount of clothing that you’re going to sweat into while traveling. If you’re going to be warm when moving without it anyway, then it’s just a container for water you’ll need to deal with later. Once you’re no longer traveling and generating heat, get the minimal wet layers off your skin as much as possible, let what’s left on your skin evaporate, and then put dry layers between the remaining wet layers and your skin. Your layers will be far more effective that way, and you’ll be able to carry fewer of them and hopefully spend far less time shivering. I hope this helps someone.
