ARE YOU COLD? - TOMMY CLECKNER I’m always hesitant to write caving advice, because I’m worried that half the readers will read it and think, ‘Well duh’ and the other half will think, ‘Really? I’ve never had that problem before’, assuming anyone reads it at all. For the most part, I hope that’s the case with this piece. However, there is an audience who I think can benefit from reading this – new(ish) cavers who are out there doing hard trips, and are getting cold, sometimes dangerously so, when they do not have to. I certainly seem to know enough of them. If that sounds familiar, let’s address layering for cave trips. Appropriate layering is something that other outdoor hobbies figured out a long time ago – a lot of words have been written about it and you don’t have to dive very far into any of them to find resources explicitly addressing the concept. I haven’t seen that in the caving community. It makes sense – caving is different. Cave temperature doesn’t swing widely over the course of the day, and the weather conditions are predictable. Overcast, maybe a little muggy. But caving isn’t *that* different, especially when trips get longer and start to incorporate changes of pace and intensity. Lots of heat gets generated when you’re hustling out to the lead, and substantially less of it gets generated when you’re surveying, or waiting at a rope. The cave will stay the same temperature, but you won’t. To be comfortable for an entire trip, a caver needs to have a coherent layering strategy that is tuned to their body and for the changes in intensity that will occur on their trip. I don’t see many cavers who don’t already get this concept – the ones who don’t always learn quickly. What I do see a lot of, and what prompted me to write this article, is cavers sabotaging their layering systems by wearing too much from the start. They cave hard out to their objective, and sweat the whole time they’re doing it. Once there, they put on the shirt that usually keeps them warm, and then get cold anyway. Their skin is wet, their under-layers are soaked, and all that moisture helps take heat from their body, putting it into a wet, muddy cave suit and then eventually into the cave air. It’s a lot of water to evaporate, and it’s cold work. Often, they respond by doubling down and wearing even more the next trip, in a vicious feedback loop. It works eventually because modern fabrics don’t hold that much water, and are still effective when wet – though not as much as they would be dry. The adjustment I’m advocating is an attempt to stay dry(er), rather than carry and wear more layers. That’s not the same as ‘don’t sweat’. On harder trips, I know I’m going to sweat when I’m moving. When running was a more consistent hobby, shirt season didn’t start until temperatures dropped below 50oF. That’s colder than most eastern caves, and when I’m caving hard in those, it’s not much less exertion than running, and I’m wearing a Cordura bag. It’s toasty. I approach this problem by wearing as little as I can get away with under my cave suit (t-shirt, light leggings), and by caving with my suit open as much as is practical. When I stop, I try to open my suit up and let the steam out. Skin doesn’t hold much water – it only takes a few minutes for it to get dry again. If my travel layers are light enough, a few more minutes might be enough for them to dry too. If I’m going to be stopped for a while – usually surveying – I take my sweaty travel layers off, dry for a minute, put my warm layer(s) on, put
