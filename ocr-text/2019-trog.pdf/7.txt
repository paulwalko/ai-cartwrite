The first of the two bags contains the following:
• 3rd headlamp. Zebralight H53w, I prefer a sub-100 gram light (including headband)
for wearing at camp without my helmet which is basically all my backup-backup light
gets used for. There exist lighter headlamps, but I like zebras.
• Spare batteries. LG MJ1's are the best right now.
Lighter. Small Bic. I prefer white so you can see the fuel level easier, but I bought too
many hammer drills so I'm saving up to replace my blue one.
• Heat source. I'm trying out Esbit fuel tablets.
Trash bags. I have two lightweight kitchen bags. These can be worn as extra layers or
as a heat tent. The hair tie is handy for keeping yours or others luscious locks out of
rappel devices.
Space Blanket. I'm sure we're all familiar with these.
Drugs. I have naproxen sodium, ear plugs, *redacted*, benadryl, imodium, iodine
tabs, *redacted*, and caffeine. Pills are padded with plastic wrap, and the case
wrapped with a meter or so of duct tape and secured with a hair tie.
Extra survey pages. I have two. Paper is handy. Survey paper especially so.
• Waterproof paper. This is probably redundant.
• Gauze pads. I have four.
• Band Aids. I have two big ones. My knees would be in better shape if I had these over
the course of a mile of crawling in Blue Spring.
• Point kit. Pencil, sharpie, flagging tape, witeout, and a spoon.
