ALPINE CAVING – REILLY BLACKWELL
Background: This summer I did several survey trips in Blood Cave, which is a 38 degree cave
in Flathead County, MT. The approach is a 14 mile hike through the Bob Marshall Wilderness,
so most trips are done on the basis of a weeklong expedition, camping in the North Cirque of
Silvertip Mountain.
One problem: this is a cold cave, requiring specialized gear, but whatever you bring you must
carry out. So, I had to get my outfit dialed in just right. Luckily I had input from others with
more alpine cave experience, so I was relatively comfy and happy the whole time. Others
were not so lucky and either sweated or froze.
Here's what I recommend wearing for a wet 38-degree survey trip:
0
On the way in (about a 3-hour “commute" to the back of the cave, moving fast with medium-
weight packs):
One thin, long-sleeved polypro shirt.
o Others found a synthetic t-shirt under the PVC suit to be sufficient.
Two thin polypro leggings. A slightly heavier bottom layer would also work.
A Buff or other lightweight headcovering - keeps your ears warm; keeps the sweat
out of your eyes while you're trying to keep up with all the stupid expedition cavers
you made the mistake of traveling with.
The Blue PVC Project Caver Gloves that everyone who sketches in muddy caves has.
Glove liners - I tried thin polypro ones and thicker bicycling gloves; the latter are far
superior.
Wellies (sorry, TAG cavers) - these enable you to gloat about how dry your feet are
right up until the point you fill them.
• A pair of fleecy socks and a pair of neoprene socks.
PVC suit (I have a Meander) - makes you an invincible waterproof warrior; makes it
impossible to distinguish between cavers from more than three feet away.
Vertical gear - I have a Petzl Simple because it's light and compact, a Petzl Basic as a
top ascender, two cowstails with nonlocking 'biners, and switched from the MTDE
Amazonia to the regular GGG seat harness for weight and size reasons.
• Lightweight kneepads - I had one old black volleyball kneepad and one old white one

When stopped for the first time (when you reach the lead):
