Roppel Cave (part of Mammoth Cave, Kentucky)
BWOB South, Pete's Lunch Passage
Bill Koerschner*, John DeLong, Holly McClintock, Hannah Lieffring, Jason Weyland
Objective: Show Holly the route to Congress Way via the Topofil Link and point out some
leads.
Work on digging through the sand blow past W3 (off B107) to find the suspected lift tube that
is dropping out the sand. Survey lead at B103 and loop between B111 and B117.
Summary:
The transient pool in the People Eater was present and 25 ft long instead of 6 ft long.
Welcome to the wettest year in Kentucky history.
•
B103 upper level crawl was surveyed for 30ft and continues 2Hx1.5W with air
•
Completed about 3/5s of the loop from B111 to B117 – out of time
• The dig at W3 was worked on for only 1 hour due to cold, fatigue and lack of people
•
99.5 ft of survey – all new cave. New World Record!
In:
11:25 am
Out: 4:00 am (16.5 hour trip)
Report:
Bill Koerschner led a jovial and enthusiastic crew into Roppel and returned them to the
surface some 16.5 hours later; mum, stone-beat and exhausted after being 'Eht' by the
People Eater Crawl.
We entered the Weller Entrance to Roppel and set a leisurely pace out to Grand Junction
via the Brucker Connection, arriving in about 2 hours. We proceeded upstream in Elysian
Way and turned left into Transgressions Trail, then down the slot into Topofil Link.
