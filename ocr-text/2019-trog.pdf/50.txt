THE MEMBERSHIP REQUIREMENTS OF THE WVU STUDENT GROTTO -
TOMMY CLECKNER
Student grottoes have been central to my introduction to the caving community: first with
VPI in Virginia, and now with the Nittany Grotto in Pennsylvania. A striking difference
between them is training â€“ VPI famously has a formal training program, while the Nittany
Grotto has none and takes a more casual approach. Despite the difference, both grottoes
have produced many excellent cavers over the years. The difference got me interested in
learning how other student grottoes take on the challenge of turning inexperienced students
into competent cavers and grotto leaders. I started my investigation by contacting Ben
Mirable, an esteemed alumnus of the WVU Student Grotto. To my surprise, he informed me
that WVUSG *does* have a training program, and even supplied me with this sign-off sheet.
Naturally, I had some follow-up questions. Ben happily obliged.
Me: Thanks for taking the time Ben. First question, why does WVU have a training program?
Ben: Caving's dangerous, especially with WVU, and you've got to be prepared.
Me: Interesting. Why are there so few requirements? As you may know, VPL has 13.
Ben: Well, for practical reasons we had to stay under 10.
Me: Practical reasons?
Ben: Machete training can be pretty dangerous, and it is West Virginia after all. The average
member can only count but so high.
Me: Ah. Well, you do manage to fit a lot in there. The hot tub requirement is quite prescient,
what with the Great Rupture of OTR 2018. We thought Shitty Elliot was a goner. Why do you
train for that?
Ben: We know a VPI Member runs that area. It was going to happen eventually.
Me: Fair. Thanks again for taking the time. See you guys in Bone-Norman again this year?
Ben: Absolutely.
