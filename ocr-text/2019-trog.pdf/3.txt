A NOTE FROM THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT
Hello wonderful cave critters!
The VPI Cave club had a wonderful year! We started off strong by hosting Fall
VAR even with the torrential rains. It was a great time seeing cavers from all
around this area! Over the holidays Deighan led his infamous Mexico trip once
again. We had an awesome program talking about all their cave adventures
and shenanigans. One of our new members hosted a TAG trip over Spring
break and it was so successful that Dave Hughes named the newly discovered
"Hokie Well‚Äù in honor of the trip! Then the one and only Eric Stanley brought
back the First Aid presentation but now NEWER, BIGGER, AND BETTER! Lastly,
over this past year we voted in 7 new members from 176-182! All in all, this
year has been quite successful and a lot of fun. We thank everyone for an
awesome year as your executive officers!
Cave Safely!
Gillian Rowland (President) and Nathan Kearney (Vice President)
P.S. We were willing to bring back the carbide lamp test during our last meeting, but no one brought it up
before we were kicked out. Your loss. ;)
