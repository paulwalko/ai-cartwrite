Perfect.
CHOCOLATE
COOL MINT
The second bag contains the following:
• Clif bar. Mint is my “favorite” flavor.
Gummy bears. Good for quick energy and a whole lot easier to stomach than another
damn clif bar.
Water. Plastic 375ml Evan Williams bottle. Muscle memory improves drinking
efficiency.
Between these two bags I have everything I need for most sport caving trips. This doesn't
include my rope knife, whistle and watch which I carry in my suit pocket, or the vertical rescue
kit which I would carry on my harness if I deemed it necessary for the trip. This also doesn't
include any extra webbing or cord but some could be worn as a belt. I also don't have an extra
shirt, but the trash bags can be worn as extra layers. And as always, caving is dangerous (don't
do it) and if you miss signout because you listened to something I said, you're on your own.
