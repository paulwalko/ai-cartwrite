when you use two feet. Two small loops alleviates this problem but has
another loop that can get caught on things. Putting both the small loops on
one foot may increase comfort. One small loop is nice if you're only planning
on using one foot. Be sure the loop is big enough for a large boot to fit into
easily.
This should be adjusted such that the top ascender just barely touches the
chest ascender when you take a full step. If it is too short or more often, too
long, it'll take more time and effort than necessary to climb any distance.
You can store it between pitches by wrapping it over your shoulder and
clipping it back into itself, or by clipping the loop into the carabiner, twisting
the cord several times, then folding the cord and clipping it into the
carabiner.
Good options include the AV Footup, MTDE Siam, and the small production
run of full-dyneema footloops that I'm probably never doing again unless you
ask extra nice. OK options include the Petzl Footcord and tied dyneema cord.
Bad options include most other things. Dyneema is worth it, promise.

Cow's Tails
o These are used to attach your top ascender, and to navigate traverse lines
and rebelays. The “short” Cow's Tail is usually just clipped to the side of your
harness and the “long” Cow's Tail is clipped into your top ascender. If your
top ascender can only fit one carabiner, clip the long Cow's Tail carabiner to
the locking footloop carabiner.
Use Imm+ dynamic “single” rope, tied in the middle with an overhand knot
and the ends tied with barrel knots and 3"-4" of tail. The “long” Cow's Tail
should allow you to extend your top ascender fully while on rope but be no
longer than that. The “short” Cow's Tail should be long enough such that
