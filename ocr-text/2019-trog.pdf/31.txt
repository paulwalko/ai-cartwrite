o Micro-Rack: A compromise of sorts between the rack and bobbin. I don't
much like them but a lot of people do. Similar range to a bobbin. Stiff rope is
annoying to stuff between the bars. Don't feed rope.
o
Other things: Probably don't.

â€¢ Footloop
O This is attached to your top ascender and used to stand in. Connect it with a
carabiner instead of a screwlink or tying it straight in so you can use it for
pickoffs and many other things. Tie it to the carabiner with a locked-off
munter hitch, or double overhand like on your cow's tails. If you can only clip
one carabiner into your top ascender, the footloop carabiner needs to be a
locking carabiner.
O Look for body of ultra-static cord and webbing that goes under the foot.
Avoid full-webbing and ultra-skinny cord footloops as they get caught in
chest ascender. The cord should be uninterrupted in the middle by knots or
hardware.
o There can be one large loop, two small, or one small. One large loop allows
you to have one or two feet in the loop, but the footloop changes length
