lighter, smaller, encourage better climbing form, and allow for a longer
climbing stride. If you want the handle, left handed versions are preferable
because it's more logical to put them on rope at rebelays without tangling
them.
o Good options include name-brand gear. Bad options include eBay Chinese
gear, but $20 is $20.
o New Petzl ascenders are nice but all other brands (and old Petzl ascenders)
will last longer because Petzl recently started using stainless steel for the
cams, which is softer and wears fasters.

Chest Ascender
o This will be your primary source of frustration. It has a tendency to either
cause the rope to bunch up making you pull the rope through, or slide
straight up without grabbing the rope and cause you to slide right back down
making you stand up again and force the cam shut with your hand.
Sometimes you get to do both! Remember to always close the cam
immediately so nothing gets stuck in it.
o Again, good options include name-brand gear. Bad options include eBay
Chinese gear, but $20 is still $20. This will be your main point of attachment
so it's worth the money to get a good one.
O You'll often hear the chest ascender referred to as a “Croll” because the Petzl
Croll was one of the first chest ascenders. I like the new small Croll, but some
people hate it. Petzl recently reintroduced the larger Croll, but it has the new
soft teeth. If you want a big Croll, either buy a different brand or find an old
one.
