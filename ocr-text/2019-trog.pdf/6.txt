A SMALLER, LIGHTER PACK - PHILLIP MONEYHUN VPI #451
When I'm planning on caving for over 12 hours or I'm carrying a lot of gear (often both) I like
my Landjoff 33HW, in yellow of course. I prefer wearing my vertical gear between pitches so
I don't have to put it in my bag, and the harness helps keep the cave suit oriented properly.
But without ropes, survey equipment, bolting stuff and vertical gear taking up space I've
found my bag can be very empty on sport trips. This got me wondering how small I could
make sport pack. I was able to fit a 500ml nalgene, some food, a shirt, assorted "emergency"
gear, and my vertical rescue kit in my yellow Landjoff bolting bag. This was much more
convenient than a giant bag as I could hang it off my chest harness. It was a dream to crawl
with and I hardly ever had to mess with it.
Perfect

These two bags contain all my essential and can be worn inside my suit. They are slim and do
not affect caving under most conditions. It is easy to remove them and carry them in hand or
slung around the neck if necessary.
