If you don't have several hundred dollars to spare, get a point and shoot camera.
These cameras are about the size of a deck of cards and have enough options to be configured
for cave use. They run under $150 new, but you don't need to buy one. Why? I all but
guarantee your parents used one to take pictures of you as a kid and stuck it in a drawer when
their phones got cameras. Mine (fig. 2) came with an SD card preloaded with Christmas 2011.
Thanks Mom!
3. Take pictures! Get in a cave, find something that looks cool, take out any accessories (like
an external flash or a tripod) that you've burdened your fellow cavers with and get your
camera in your hands. I'm certain that you've already read and understood your camera's
manual and practiced operating the aperture, ISO and shutter speed controls at home in a
darkened room before now. If not, good luck! Identify the subject of your first piece of fine
cave art and point the camera in its general direction.

Now, for the button clicking. The first thing to select is the ISO rating you'll shoot with.
This changes the camera sensor's sensitivity to light and in film cameras was actually the size
of the silver halide particles on the film. An ISO that is too low (like 100) will result in an image
that is too dark and an iso that is too high (like 4800) will result in an image that is
unreasonably grainy. This is where pixel size comes into play: a phone camera struggles at
ISO 400, while a Ha$$elblad medium format camera will be fine at ISO 12800.
The next option you'll want to set is your aperture. A more open aperture (like f.2)
lets more light into the camera but leaves a smaller distance in focus, leading to blurry
backgrounds and angry friends sitting around watching you try to manually get a rock
