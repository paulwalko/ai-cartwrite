• Other things that are nice to have.
o Foot ascender. These can improve climbing efficiency and make technical
maneuvers easier. The Petzl Pantin is the most ubiquitous, and the old green
one is my favorite because you can lock it off with a carabiner.
Pulley. Carry one even if you don't know how to use it; someone else might
know but not have one. It could be mighty handy if a “situation" arises.
o Gloves. Leather gloves make rappelling fast a lot nicer. PVC gauntlets are the
ticket if you can keep a lid on your speed.
