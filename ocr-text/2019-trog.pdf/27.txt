HOW TO SET UP A CLIMBING SYSTEM - PHILLIP MONEYHUN VPI #451
So you're thinking about building a climbing system! Woohoo! Here's a few paragraphs of
unsolicited but strongly held opinions. Some things you hear or read will contradict what |
have written. Good luck with that! When in doubt, Alpine Caving Techniques is the bible and
be careful about taking “On Rope” too seriously.
Here's what you'll need:
•
D-link
o This is essential for any caving-style harness. Do not buy a harness that
doesn't use a D-link.
O Easily available options include galvanized steel, stainless steel, or aluminum
alloy half-moon screwlinks, and screwlock or autolocking Petzl Omni.
o Stainless screwlinks get stuck and bent easily. Galvanized are cheap. The
Petzl Omni is expensive and heavy but many people like it. I prefer the
aluminum alloy screwlinks because they're light and cheap, I don't like
autolocking things for caving, and a screw-Omni is a little pointless, heavy,
and expensive. Also, you can also fit the Raumer Handy directly on a half-
moon screwlink without modification.
The D-link should be oriented such that it closes to the left from the wearer's
perspective. This keeps it from unscrewing while ascending. The Cow's Tails
belong on the left, the chest ascender to the right, and the descender (and
braking carabiner) either in the middle or far right depending on what
devices and carabiners you use.
Seat Harness
o Look for a low attachment point, more than 2 gear loops, and PVC wrapped
loops. Avoid padding, autolocking buckles, and things not made in Europe.
Try several and pick one that works with your body.
o Good options include the Petzl Superavanti, and MTDE Amazonia. OK options
include Gonzo Guano Gear harnesses and the MTDE Club. Bad options
include most other things. Sorry. I prefer the Amazonia. It's worth the cost
