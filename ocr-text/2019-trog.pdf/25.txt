• A dry synthetic shirt - take off your sweaty layer and put the dry layer next to your
skin. Really feel and savor the cave in that moment when you have to be shirtless
with wet skin in the stiff breeze of the passage.
When stopped at all (once you start to get cold: in my experience, as soon as you stop
moving):
• Fleece balaclava - the single best value item of cave gear I have ever purchased
When you start to get really cold (you may have thought you were cold before; you were
wrong!):
• Lightweight fleece layer, overtop both shirts. Patagucci Microsquare Fancyduds are
nice; I got mine at the Huntsville Salvation Army thrift store.
• At this point you will be wearing so many layers you can employ a locomotion
technique known as “pinballing” - the cave can no longer harm you, so feel free to
throw yourself at the walls and bounce off in the direction you're attempting to
travel.
When you get colder than that:
This is when you find out everyone's best dance moves. Jason Ballensky likes to
utilize the “I like to Move It Move It” dance and I consider this an exemplary
technique.
I can also recommend yelling loudly about how cold you are, or shrieking like a fire
alarm without warning in the middle of the survey. It's like yoga firebreathing, and
has the added benefit of giving your colleagues a warming adrenaline rush as they
jump with surprise and fall down the canyon they're perched in.
When you find a pit that's rigged in the water (why are there so many of these in freezing
caves? It's not fun anymore, guys! The world may never know):
Most PVC suits have hoods: put them up! If you're like me, the more commonly
utilized method is to forget you have a hood, start climbing in a waterfall, think “oh
crap, there's a lot of water running down my neck for some reason," and ignore it
until your PVC suit starts to resemble a water balloon.
If you have an Elios or a Vertex Vent, “vents up mode” is surprisingly essential. I'll
quote Rear Admiral Ballensky on this: “You commuted in here with your vents up?!
You fool! You amateur! What are you going to do when you get cold now, huh?
Probably just die!"
On the way out:
Keep all your stuff on until you're overheating to the point that your body pushes
some circulation out to your extremities and you can feel your fingers and toes
again.
