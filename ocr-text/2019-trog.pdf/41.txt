Oh, the year was 1778 How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now A letter of marque came from the king To the scummiest vessel I've ever seen
(Refrain) God damn them all! I was told We'd cruise the seas for American gold We'd fire no guns, shed no tears But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier The last of Barrett's Privateers
Oh, Elcid Barrett cried the town How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now For twenty brave men all fishermen who Would make for him the Antelope's crew
(Refrain)
The Antelope’s sloop was a sickening sight How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now She'd a list to the port and her sails in rags And the cook’s in the scupper with the staggers and jags
(Refrain)
