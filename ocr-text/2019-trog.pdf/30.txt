Descender
o Hoooooh boy. Wars have been fought over smaller disagreements than
cavers arguing about descenders. The main devices include:
o Figure-8: Cheap, but shouldn't be used much over ~100' and frustrating on
stiff rope. Try not to drop it. Be aware of the Munter hitch if you do.
o
6-bar Rack: Expensive (unless you find one used or as a gift!) and good for
just about any distance. Heavy, bulky, and difficult to do rebelays and
technical maneuvers with. Hyperbars make tying off easier. Be aware of the
cross-loading issue and zipper rigging. Don't use spacers unless you're doing
very long drops. Longer frames exist for especially long rappels but the
standard frame is fine for everything in the US and some people even use the
standard frame for the big pits in Mexico.
o
Bobbin: Affordable, versatile, and light! What's not to like! My preferred
device. Good for ~300' or so. Available as standard (shown) or auto-stop
models. Be aware of C-rigging issues, carabiners that can cause accidental
opening, and braking carabiner size issues. Make sure the latch is shut, and
don't forget your braking carabiner.
