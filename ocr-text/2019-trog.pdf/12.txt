POEM - ALEX CORRIGAN
Descending into the darkness of another realm,
floating yet tethered by the rope you're hooked to.
On this submarine you're at the helm,
Diving into a world strange and new.
Helmet upon your head and gear upon your frame,
Secure in exploring a foreign domain.
Weight of worlds above you and weight of the world below,
Headlights shine around as others share what they know,
From cave life and safety, to how formations grow.
Exploring an ethereal landscape, watching underground streams flow.
Droplets on the ceiling glitter in the light,
Lit up like a myriad of stars in the night.
From cramped crawls to colossal caverns,
Shadows dance in random patterns
Across flowstone and rimstone.
A stalagmite serves as a throne
For a small salamander, orange and covered in spots.
Near the entrance, a log covered in fungi slowly rots.
A plethora of fossils can sometimes be found
If only you know where to look, they abound.
The weight of the earth presses down,
somehow lighter than this feeling of profound wonder.
It's silent and peaceful here underground,
Drops of water create a backdrop of sound.
Here there is a stillness, it's thrilling this
Feeling that time seems to slow as you go deeper into the earth.
After being surrounded in darkness, emerging into the light feels like rebirth.
