On the King's birthday we put to sea How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now We were 91 days to Montego Bay Pumping like madmen all the way
(Refrain)
On the 96th day we sailed again How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight With our cracked four pounders we made to fight
(Refrain)
Now the Yankee lay low down with gold How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now She was broad and fat and loose in the stays But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days
(Refrain)
Then at length we stood two cables away How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now Our cracked four pounders made an awful din But with one fat ball the Yank stove us in
(Refrain)
