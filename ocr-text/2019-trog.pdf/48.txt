A MODEST PROPOSAL – ROWAN BERMAN Proposal for an Observational Study: This would be a study designed to investigate the factors that best help a caver squeeze their slimy mud-covered body through the Nasty in Links cave. This study would take into account several factors: age (years), weight (pounds), height (inches), experience (total years caving), pack (yes or no), hungover (yes or no), and gender (male or female) as explanatory variables, and with the time (seconds) required to transverse the Nasty as the response variable. In order to keep the recording of data as constant as possible, I propose that there be one person on each side of the nasty, the one at the exit holding the timer. Since I don’t own a scale and am too lazy to measure people with a tape measure, factors like age, weight, height, and experience would be reported by the participant to the researcher and recorded. Analysis would be conducted by me when I’m over caffeinated, with R and Minitab software. We would be attempting to discover any relation between the explanatory factors and the response. The scope of this study would be limited just to the ability of someone to go through the Nasty in Links, but could prompt further investigation into caving in general, or just to the sucky squeezy bits. Since it would be an observational study it is also important to remember that we are looking for relationships between the explanatory and response variable but would not be able to prove any cause or effect. Each individual in the study would be incentivized to participate with a can of PBR or a doughnut to join the study. Because of the limited number of local cavers that will put up with my stupidity there wouldn’t be an opportunity to select the participants randomly from, but since this is a ridiculous study and I don’t think anyone else in the club is majoring in statistics, I think we can get away with this. To be able to conduct this study I would require a ton of enthusiastic cavers, a dozen doughnuts, a case of PBR, and fifty dollars.
Sincerely, Rowan The Great & Powerful
