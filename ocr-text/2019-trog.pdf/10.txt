GRIM TAWNEY'S â€“ CHRIS CERNE
The most scared I've ever been on a trip was at Grim Tawney's. This was my first foray into
miserable caving, but because I enjoy being miserable, I figured why not. The trip happened
on Sunday, December 2.
The entrance to the cave was a sketchy gate that required a key, and so all of us trainees
shuffled in, already miserable from the cold December weather. We walked in, but were
given a spiel about hypothermia and wearing extra layers. I didn't think too much of it, until
we had to pass a body of freezing cold water.
Members of the VPI Caving Club love putting their bodies through physical stress, so I cringed
as I watched everyone shuffle past the water. The passage was oriented in such a way such
where there was about half a foot of breathing room above the water. This means that to get
through this passage, you have to twist your head and pray you don't get scared and start
hyperventilating.
Of course, it was soon my turn. I go into the cold body of water, already freezing my ass off.
Wanting to get the whole experience over with, I try to get through the passage as quick as
possible.
Big. Mistake.
I could breathe through my nose, but not through my mouth, which had me scared shitless.
At this point, my whole body was shaking, and I was hyperventilating. I've never had a panic
attack before, but I felt like I had just experienced one.
I did not make it through. I went back to safety as quick as possibly, got out of the water, and
caught my breath. But this would not be the end. I wanted to catch up with my fellow trainees
and live to tell the tail. So I jumped back into the water, starting adjusting, and slowly made
my way through the passage. The passage was shorter than I thought, and I made it through
with almost no issues this time.
