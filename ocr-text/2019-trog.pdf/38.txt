RACKS AND BOBBINS AND CARABINERS, OH MY! - PHILLIP MONEYHUN VPI

An often overlooked aspect of vertical caving equipment is the specifics of carabiner
interaction. There have been documented deaths and injuries each of the issues presented
below. Learn from the mistakes of others to keep from becoming a statistic.
Racks require a special consideration. SAD, or Sudden Accidental Disconnect, is a
phenomenon which occurs when a rack is deweighted, twisted, and then reweighted
resulting in the eye of the rack breaking the gate of the carabiner and potentially leaving the
user to air-rappel the remainder of the drop. This can be addressed by using a screwlink
instead, or an anti-crossloading carabiner. However, it is still important to ensure that the
rack is attached and oriented correctly no matter what you are using. The same problem
exists with figure-eight devices, but seems to be less likely. My preference is the Petzl “ultra
rapide" screwlinks.
Bobbin rappel devices, such as the Petzl Simple and Petzl Stop, have a similar issue. It
is possible for some carabiners to twist and open the bobbin gate latch, which can allow the
rope to come out of the device leaving the user to fall. There does not exist a comprehensive
list of compatible carabiners, so users should test to make sure their carabiner is safe. “Fatter”
carabiners will tend to be safer. The lightest "safe" carabiner for the Petzl Stop and Simple
with the black plastic gate I have yet found is the Black Diamond Positron Screwgate. Under
no circumstances should a screwlink be used to attach a bobbin.
Bobbins also require the use of a braking carabiner. The braking biner does not have
to be full strength, but it must be strong enough not to deform under normal use. The natural
position is directly to the right of the bobbin on the d-link. However, there is a risk if the
braking carabiner is too large. If a force is applied to the braking end of the rope, such as a
