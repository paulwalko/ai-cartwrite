belay tug or a rebelay below failing, the top of the bobbin can become trapped in the braking
carabiner, leaving the user to fall in an uncontrollable low friction mode. This can be
prevented by using a smaller braking carabiner such as small accessory biners or the Raumer
Handy. It is important to test if your carabiner is small enough if you intend to use this
position. With your top ascender attached above your bobbin as a safety, have a friend apply
a load to the rope below you (above ground!) and see if the bobbin becomes trapped. If not,
you're good to go. If it does, the braking carabiner can be clipped directly to the bobbin
carabiner to prevent the issue. The Petzl Frieno is an all-in-one braking and attachment
carabiner. It should be avoided due to its cost and tendency to wear out the side plate of the
bobbin. The “Vertico” technique has a similar problem. The best solution in my experience
has been to use a small steel accessory carabiner clipped to the right of the bobbin with the
gate opening up and facing the user. Steel lasts a lot longer and offers a smoother rappel. If I
only used skinny rope I would likely use the Raumer Handy, but it is too aggressive for 11mm
ropes.
