Prior to going on my first cave trip last year I honestly didn’t really know or at least pay any attention to the fact that there were caves. Honestly I didn’t know that caving was even a thing. As I have talked to more students not involved in the club about the topic I have discovered this is definitely not the case for a larger amount of people than there should be. Recently I was talking to some random new Virginia Tech students who had brought up the topic of their most recent trip in new river. Ironically this group had attempted to get to the waterfall they had heard about and ended up in the stream area we had spent time searching during the rescue. If you were looking for a waterfall, following a stream might seem like a logical choice. Unfortunately if you take the wrong turn early you can end up finding nothing but yourself more lost. Luckily they were able to get back the way they came, although he did admit they didn’t bring any helmets and only one light source. I have talked to several other students who have also made this attempt in New River, one having a roommate who actually got lost in the cave and only got out by someone finding him by chance. After spending more time with cave club, the rescue squad, and in caves in general I’ve definitely developed a greater appreciation for the sign out process, safety gear, and everyone involved in the process of making this activity safer. Overall I found it to be a very noteworthy and useful experience, and would definitely recommend participating in a practice cave rescue to other trainees.
