CLOVER HOLLOW TRIP REPORT - CHRIS CERNE
One of the most thrilling and fascinating caving trips I've been on is a trainee trip to Clover
Hollow. Before this trip, I had only been on four trips: Starnes, James, Links, and Giant.
Because of my inexperience, I had no idea what to expect: I had only been a part of the club
for just over a month. But this trip turned out to be the trip that pushed me over the edge
and got me fully committed to the VPI Cave Club.
It was a Sunday on October 7, 2018, and we signed out around 10 A.M. The cave entrance
drop wasn't terrible as my second ever vertical trip, but soon enough, we came to almost a
100 foot drop.
Past this drop, we would experience the most beautiful cave formations: the Gypsum
Flowers. We would also experience the VPI Cave Club library, filled chalk-full with trainee
learning materials and a nice futon for relaxation purposes.
My most memorable experience from this trip was learning about the other trainees, and of
course, getting to know Meredith and Nathan better. We shared stories, jokes, and
personalities, and I realized that these folks would soon become good friends of mine.
Although leaving the cave was physically exhausting, as us trainees have not mastered vertical
(which subsequently made this a 12 hour trip), going caving at Clover Hollow was one of my
favorite caves yet.
