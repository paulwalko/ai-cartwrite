In my experience of learning and meeting the requirements for membership in cave club, one of the single most interesting and educational experiences I have had has been participating in a practice cave rescue in the New River cave. With this we got to see the sheer amount of time, manpower, and equipment necessary to safely rescue someone from a cave. These numbers could vary even more depending on the circumstances, such as how difficult the cave is to travel and navigate and whether or not it was vertical. The injury and state of the person needing rescue could also increase these factors. For our rescue there were three people we were trying to rescue who were spread throughout the cave with different injuries and mental states. We were put into groups with multiple cavers, for this cave at least one having a decent idea of what locations we were looking for. We then were sent to search different areas in the cave. Altogether we spent about four hours of straight searching until we found all three missing people and got them out of the cave. For the rescue simulation we learned how to deal with spelunkers that were intoxicated, injured, and bitter. In my group we were able to see a top belay being used in a cave, as well as other techniques and rules such as to not leave the lost spelunker completely alone when reporting back to base. Actually, seeing these techniques and thought processes in person really helped me get an idea of how to react to these kind of situations. I found the rescue to also be beneficial in getting a better understanding of the layout of the New River cave itself. We searched most areas accessible to spelunkers during the rescue, which in this cave was an extensive amount of ground to cover. Considering how well known and traveled the touristy areas of New River are, such as the waterfall or forest room, I had found that even after multiple visits I was still uncertain on the correct path any many parts of the cave. During the rescue my group spent the majority of the time searching for the third missing person. Through this process we not only completed multiple visits to the known parts of the cave such as the waterfall, forest room, and planetarium, but also the “wrong ways” that someone who was uncertain of the path might take. It was surprisingly easy for us to take a wrong turn even with someone in are group having an idea where we are going. In many rescue situations the rescuers might not have any former knowledge of the layout of the cave. Our group spent a significant amount of time searching the streams that could be found by taking a wrong turn on the way to the waterfall because of a comment the first spelunker found had made about her friend. We discovered there were many ways to get to a stream, some continuing deeper into the cave for longer than we could even tell. After experiencing how many times we got lost trying to navigate this part, it isn’t very hard to see how someone lost and especially intoxicated could continue to get themselves even more lost and deeper into the cave. Even after all of that I still wouldn’t call myself a hundred percent confident on these parts of the cave.
