O
with your elbow at your D-link, the carabiner is in your palm. Adjust from
there based on preference.
Carabiners should be large enough to fit two 11mm ropes, straight gate
because bent gates can open when twisted, and keynose because hooknose
sucks. I like the Petzl Ange L carabiners but there exist many good options.
The carabiner on the short end needs to be nonlocking, but the carabiner on
the long end can be locking if you want it to be.
Replace the rope at least every 5 years. Replace immediately if the sheath is
worn through or if they've caught a fall.

Carabiners
O You're going to need a few for attaching all your equipment, a few spares,
and some for rigging. Different shapes have different purposes. Most of the
carabiners in your climbing system should be an offset “D” shape because
these are lightest. Rigging carabiners can be smaller “D” shaped carabiners. A
“pear” shaped carabiner is good for using with a munter hitch or storing
equipment. Oval carabiners... well people say they're nice but I've found
them to largely be a pain in the ass. People tend to prefer it when you rig
with locking carabiners. Carry one or two "extra" carabiners and you'll be
happier for it.
