KEGEL'S CHASM: THE EXERCISE FOR PEAK PELVIC PERFORMANCE -
RICARDO ACEVEDO
Have you ever found yourself lacking endurance in your loins or perhaps not having
the proper fuel to stoke your fiery passion? Maybe you've found yourself lacking in rope and
need to turn back. Or most importantly, been found frogging up 180 feet of highline so
bouncy you can't help but feel like a pornstar desperately trying to be picked up by a big-
name producer with every bounce? All such difficulties can be remedied with my simple
exercise regimen consisting of deliberate pelvic motions.
If you're like me then you've probably had your fair share of climbing systems which
have gone unoptimized for far longer than you're willing to admit due to laziness or as I like
to say, a big case of priority evaluation non-initiation (due to) slothfulness. Being the lazy
person that I am, I never fixed my long footloops at any point during a week spent at TAG and
instead developed a simple but effective workaround. To squeeze out a couple more inches
per stride, I gave hearty pelvic thrusts to push the croll up in time with the bouncing of some
of the stretchiest rope I've ever been on. Pelvic stamina was critical for the viability of this
technique. Remember, a healthy pelvis is a well-rounded pelvis and so the following should
only be the beginning of your journey for strong but supple hips and loins.
1. Place your feet a shoulder length apart with your hands on your hips and
lean forward as far as you can comfortably while keeping your legs straight
and upright. Hold the position for several seconds and return to the original
position by pushing forward with your hips rather than using your back. Repeat
15 times.
2. While sitting upright in a chair, alternate lifting each leg to a position above
parallel to the ground to flex the hip. Hold the position for several seconds and
return slowly to the relaxed starting position. This can also be done with a
similar motion while keeping the knee bent at an angle less than 90 degrees.
Repeat 20 pairs.
3. With your back straight and legs apart, lean forwards pushing your hips back
as if you were trying to moon someone below you. While maintaining this
position take several sidesteps/shuffles back and forth at an easy, regular pace
for 60 seconds. To increase intensity, wear wellies full of water.
After exercise, it is important to refuel the body properly with calories and protein.
Nothing can hope to surpass being hand fed 70 minus 1 pistachios by Alex Corrigan and
Patrick Hagerty at the top of Cagle's as I have, but any old source of protein you're used to
will do. You may just be lucky enough to have Nathan Kearney launch the final nut from
several meters away. Go ahead and stuff yourself full of the nuttiest nuts or any such protein
and salt dense food you can get down your desalinated and eager maw. Reward yourself for
your efforts and rest easy in the knowledge that you are better prepared for any of life's
pelvic demands.
