FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN – JESSE NELSON
Caves are deep dark holes in the ground where all your fears are realized. And that is
what makes them so awesome. When caving, you will be presented with many new
challenges that you may not have experienced in your everyday life. These obstacles can be
uncomfortable, and even frightening, but facing conquering these will leave you with a sense
of pride and lifetime of memories. This article describes some of the common fears people
experience while caving might help you deal with them.
The first thing you will probably notice is that caves are dark. This can cause some
nyctophobia; or fear of the dark. This one is simpler though because we all have headlamps.
If the problem persists, add more lights.
Many of the caves we visit will have crawling sections or places when the passage
sudden narrows. This is where it gets interesting because a lot of first-time cavers have not
been in a tight situation to know if they have claustrophobia or not. So, when you first go into
a tight squeeze and realize, “hey, this is more stressful than I thought this would be”, that's
perfectly fine. Like most fears, experience really helps get you through. Getting through the
passage the first time is always the worst and it gives you confidence for future trips.
However, this is a lot easier to deal with on short passages. If you can see the other side of a
squeeze it is a lot easier to venture an attempt knowing that it will only be a shorter section.
A good way to work your way up is by doing caves like New River first where this limited
crawling sections. New river is especially good because it has the one tight squeeze section
that is optional, and you can practice on that before committing to harder caves. Another
good way to practice is by going through the squeeze box. The squeeze box great because it
is an adjustable box that allows you to see what your limits actually are when trying to
squeeze through a gap. This allows you to know your limits before having the added pressure
of being in a cave.
Finally, my personal favorite (I might be a bit biased) acrophobia, or fear of heights.
This can common up often since there is a whole type of caving dedicated to it in the form of
vertical caving. But you don't have to be doing vertical caving to experience problems with
heights. You might be going along a ledge or just have what feels like a sketchy climb. This is
where having friends really helps. One of the best ways to reduce a fear is by reducing the
exposure. It is amazing the calming effect that someone spotting you has on a person. If there
is a way to safely put member between the person having troubles and the hole that is
causing the problem, it does wonders for calming that person down. For example, a shout
out to a certain Nathan that when a segment of canyon in links opened up to be a bigger
drop, straight up canyoned in to hole below a certain trainee and just locked himself in there
to block of the hole. This was really great because it eliminated the mental roadblock but
didn't actually change any of the techniques to get through links. Now on future trips they
should have an easier time traversing these obstacles because they have already done the
motions before.
