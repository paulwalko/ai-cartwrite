Meanwhile I reach the first lead at B103 and get out the survey gear. It has taken 6 hours of
hard caving to get here. Jason valiantly sets one point up the ascending crawlway before
succumbing to cold and fatigue. He returns to his pack to eat and put on warm clothes and
sends up the irrepressible Hannah to assist with the survey. Holly reports that Jason and
John will slowly make their way back to Congress Way Junction while we try to get
something done. The clock is now ticking as we have cold people waiting and we really
don't have the crew to cover the objectives.
Holly goes ahead to B107 to work on the dig while Hannah and I wrap up the lead at B103. |
am point / sketch and Hannah is on the DistoX. At BH4 the crawl makes a little S-bend and I
just can't quite get my legs past it. It continues 2Hx1.5W, dry and blowing air, but will have
to await a crew of thin, short cavers (like a thousand other leads in Mammoth Cave).
We move on to the next survey objective after first agreeing with Holly that we will meet
back at B107 in 1 hour at 8:45pm. The old notes for the B survey describe the lead at B111
as a 4Hx3W lower level that loops to B117. I was picturing easy stoopwalk but this is Roppel
so it was a nest of looping pancake components that you have to bellycrawl through to
reach spots where they cross and you briefly get the promised dimensions. We stopped at
BJ8 at 9:00 pm with more of the same ahead (5 more shots to tie B117).
We found Holly shivering at B107 – she had worked an hour at the cobblely squeeze at W3
but got too cold laying on the ground in wet clothes. She never got to inspect the sand pile
which lies beyond this first squeeze.
The retreat took so long we all began to worry that the other guys would get tired of
waiting and try to find their way out on their own. All kinds of horrid scenarios played in my
head as I slowly dragged myself back through the People Eater. We were gratified to find
Jason and John safe and sound under a space blanket at Congress Way Junction. Jason and
Hannah had a joyous reunion, base layers were replaced and wax cups were ritually burned
in what looked like some sort of pagan festival. I sat on a rock and quietly munched snacks
while this was going on, 'cuz I don't get cold.
After about an hour all the gear was back in the packs and I led the way out through Bridges
Didn't Crawl and Freedom Trail back to the Umph! Slot. Jason avoided the Death Traverse
by climbing down, walking under it and then climbing back up – who knew! The Freedom
Trail route would be the preferred way in if one didn't have to climb up the Umph! Slot. Jim
Borden says the climb up from Freedom Hall is not hard (show me) and would take you
straight to below the Death Traverse with little effort. This would really be the best way to
Congress Way, if true.
We reached Black River by 2:30 am and reached the surface right at our planned exit time
of 4am. As the song goes, “3 miles of Borehole, 80 miles of Crawl, If you've never been
Shagged by Roppel Cave, then you've never been Shagged at all!”
