â€¢ Use the fact that you need to take off your heavy fleece as an excuse to take a rest
because you're tired.
For the ladies:
Use the bathroom before the trip. If anyone was curious, I counted (my yearly
contribution to science), and in order to pee I have to remove or undo 15 separate
things.
Note: I have also done alpine cave trips where we were moving the whole time and doing
more vertical, and found two thin poly leggings and one thin long-sleeved poly shirt to be
sufficient with my PVC suit. Added a balaclava once or twice. Understanding layering and not
getting super sweaty is helpful; I wish I'd gotten good at it earlier.
