over GGG harnesses; it would take a lot more than two cases of PBR to get
me to trade my Amazonia for a GGG.
I prefer to wear my harness instead of putting it in my pack so harness bulk
isn't much of a concern to me but generally nicer harnesses with good PVC
wrapping will be fairly bulky if you try to stuff them in a pack.

Chest Harness
o This is used to advance your chest ascender and hold you upright close to the
rope. It also provides a grab point on your upper body.
o Good options include the AV Spelsholder Pro and MTDE Garma. OK options
include most other things. Bad options include whatever half-assed thing you
came up with in a parking lot and the Petzl Torse. I personally don't like
bungee harnesses but they have their enthusiasts. If you're climbing for a
long time or carrying heavy gear, having a supportive chest harness is nice. I
like my Garma but the AV harness is better value if you don't need all the
features of the Garma.
A too-tight harness can cause as many problems as a too-loose harness.
Experiment with what works best for you.
