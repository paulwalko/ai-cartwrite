PAINTING WITH LIGHT: A STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE FOR THE ASPIRING CAVE
PHOTOGRAPHER – JAY HEDEMAN
Decided to ignore the plethora of warnings that you've received and attempt to develop your
cave photography skills? If so, this is the article for you. These three easy steps will elevate
your photographic skills from kinda-sorta-
not-that-bad all the way to acceptable.
1. Take a seat and think about what you are
trying to accomplish Sure, everybody likes
cave photographers when they're on the
surface. We have lots of pretty pictures for
you to look at. It's like caving with your
eyes! Underground, however, is a different
story. As a cave photographer you'll slow
everybody down, temporarily block
passages, make your friends carry your
gear and-worst of all-force your fellow
cavers to look at you and smile. This will
lead to lots of secret (or not-so-secret)
resentment. If you think you can handle the
hate or if your friends and family already
dislike you, keep reading!

2. Find a suitable camera (or several) — What
you're looking for here is low-light
performance (because caves are dark!). This
means that you typically want a camera with
bigger pixels over one with more pixels, so
look for a large sensor size and a lower
megapixel count. It's the opinion of this
author that DSLRs have too many moving
parts, are generally too cumbersome and
will cause you to lose friends at the fastest

rate of all options. Mirrorless changeable-lens
mud in every crevice. It never comes off.
system cameras are super great and almost
always support external flashes. Put one in a dive case for the best but most expensive setup.
