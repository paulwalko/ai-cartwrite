formation in focus and asking, “How hard can it be to take a picture of a rock?" A tighter
aperture (like f.18) will leave more of the picture in focus but lets less light into the camera.
The antepenultimate knob to turn is the shutter speed. Too low a shutter speed (like
2 seconds, written as 2”) will let lots of light into the camera but the camera and subjects
must be held exceptionally still (tripod!) to prevent weird, streaky images. This effect can be
exploited to "paint” words and images by moving light sources in the camera's field of view
over a very long exposure time. Too high a shutter speed and you guessed it—the picture
is a black rectangle that you could have just taken in your bathroom at home instead of risking
life and lens underground.
Penultimately, you'll want to decide whether or not to use the flash. Generally, the
flash will produce nice images when the subject is between 5 and 15 feet (more if you bring
an external flash) from the camera and in the center of the frame. Otherwise you're better
off finding whichever of your comrades has the most patience left for your shenanigans and
asking them to point their headlamps on their brightest setting at your subject. A
photographer using the flash should take care not to breathe for several seconds before
shooting as moisture in the air can cause the flash to reflect back into the camera before
hitting the subject.
Okay, now you can actually take the picture.
