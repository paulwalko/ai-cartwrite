We stooped and crawled along Topofil Link until we reached the junction with the stream
passage at G1. I sent Jason to look at the unsurveyed and unexplored downstream lead. He
reported that it starts as a clean-washed stoopway and gradually becomes taller and
narrower such that you have to crawl along the bottom similar to in Transgressions Trail. He
stopped where the water in the bottom got to be more than a few inches - definitely a
going lead. I forgot to ask him about airflow.
We continued through the crawly stuff to the junction with Petrified Wood Passage and
turned right, ducking through the falls and on up the climbs to come out in Freedom Trail on
the far side of Bridges Didn't Crawl. The crew then sprawled themselves out in the soft dirt
to rest - "For pity sake, give them a moment!” “Get them up Legolas, in a few hours this
place will be crawling with Orcs” (People Eaters).
We jogged over to the junction with Congress Way and took a lunch break. I dumped my
wellies and replaced wet socks with dry waterproof socks. Great tip from Chris Caswell –
my feet were toasty warm for the rest of the trip.
We made our way to the left in Congress Way, which slowly lowers, becoming the People
Eater Crawl after the last bit of floor canyon disappears. Ahead lay 500 ft of bellycrawl over
popcorn encrusted cobbles with popcorn on the ceiling as well. Much low moaning was
heard, punctuated by occasional screams as the popcorn bit into particularly sensitive spots.
Thad hoped that the transient pool would, by some miracle, not be present but these hopes
were soon dashed. The pool which I had previously enjoyed in its 6 ft version was now
stretched out for a magnificent 25 feet down the bellycrawl. Needless to say, there were no
gymnastics that could prevent an unwelcome sponge bath in 1 inch of water.
On the far side there is a chest-to-back rock squeeze that John eventually popped through,
cork-like, with some coaching from Holly. Another 100 ft of popcorn encrusted cobble
crawl and we were finally through the People Eater to the junction with the ‘splendid'
Pete's Lunch Passage. The crew was underwhelmed, but at least they could sort of sit up
again. You can half-stoop, half fall forward along the canyon component until you are
forced to, you guessed it, bellycrawl along the tube at the bottom. I tried to announce the
stations that I came across in the cheeriest way possible, “WooHoo! Here is station B90!
Only 17 more to go!", but the crew had largely fallen silent except for exasperated
whimpers and whispered curses. The “Rapture of the Deep” was setting in, where each
person's thoughts turn inward to focus on their own private agony. One ceases to care
about such abstract concepts like “virgin leads at the edge of Mammoth Cave” and begins
to doubt, as the obstacles pile up behind, that they will ever have the energy to regain the
surface.
At B98 John was filtered out by a triangular chest compressor that his barrel chest could just
not pass. Oddly enough, the larger Bill Baus passed this on the last trip because he has a
triangular chest! We spent about an hour trying to enlarge the squeeze by pounding on it
with trowels and “found tools” but no meaningful progress was made and cold began to
take a toll.
