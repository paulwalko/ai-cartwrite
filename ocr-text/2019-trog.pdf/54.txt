natural area preserves protecting significant caves, and additions of several tracts
containing significant caves to existing preserves. Through the VA DCR Office of
environmental project review, Wil has helped to avoid or mitigate impacts to hundreds of
caves with the help of the Virginia Speleological Survey, with whom he is a director at large
in his spare time. Wil's current projects include the hydrology of ebb and flow karst
systems, dynamics of the phreatic aquifer of the Shenandoah Valley, use of the landscape
by Gray bats, revision and development of natural community definitions for karst systems,
Cenozoic landscape evolution in the central Appalachians, and the biological inventory of
Virginia's designated significant caves. Wil lives in Blacksburg, Virginia with his wife Zenah,
in a home frequently visited by their two grown daughters Travertine and Naomi, as well as
the usual caver riff raff.
