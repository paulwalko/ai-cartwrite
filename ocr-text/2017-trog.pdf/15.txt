FALL BREAK AT WVACS
During Virginia Tech's Fall Break, also known
as a Three Day Weekend, a large group of VT
cavers headed on over to WVACS to finally get
a taste of the Greenbrier caves so often
mentioned at the meetings.
Welcome to WVACS
Numerous trips went out and numerous folks
had their first WVACS experience. It was a
wonderful time had by almost everyone!
