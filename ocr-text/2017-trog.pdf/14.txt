TAG FALL CAVE-IN
TAG Fall Cave-In was a rip-roaring success for VPI.
A handful of folks went to various rogue caves, while
others held down the campsite. All in all, it was a
great time, despite the theft of a small fluorescent
sign in the shape of a man (named Tiny Tim) and the
Flame Out Of The Year incident (congratulations,
Peter Morisey).
SLOW!
