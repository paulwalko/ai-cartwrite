After a few days of going to places like Bletchley Park and Nelson's HMS Victory we made our way
to the city of Wells. This is the smallest city in England much like Wells has the smallest yada yada
yada... This is also where the movie Hot Fuzz was filmed which made us all quite happy to run
around and act like we were having a shoot out. It should be noted that none of us got too close
to the church though.
WELCOME TO WELLS
Englands Somalia
Having made asses of ourselves thoroughly
in the community of Wells we made our way
to the Shepton Mallet Caving Club Hut.
There are about five cave clubs in the area of
Shepton Mallet by my approximation and all
of them have field stations. This seems like a
monstrous waste of resources to me but I do
have to say that the SMCC has a corner on
the market in my mind since they are quite
convenient to the Hunter's Pub. The SMCC
also boasts having the Rude Nora light man-
ufacturers among their membership so bor-
rowing a helmet there is almost a religious
experience.

Speaking of religious experiences we also went to a cave the next day called Upper Flood that had
a gate that looked like the hatch on a tank. This is important later, I believe the literary folks call it
foreshadowing, Captain Ed calls it annoying (speaking of Captain Ed we found a great dramatic
representation of him when we were in Chile I'll include it here for your viewing pleasure).
We caved down some small stream passage for
about a mile and hung a left, I remember it be-
ing a left but it also could have been an up, it's
Caving people. We ran across some booties that
seemed to have been placed there by gnomes
for our use. Donning the booties and cleaning
ourselves off we made our way into a room of
pure white calcite formation. I'm talking the
whole room people, seriously this room was
whiter than all the Skowronski's put together,
THAT'S WHITE. The trip back out was unevent-
ful but Ellen was much happier because she had
extra snack food this time. Unfortunately every-
one on the trip exited the cave before me. I was
saddened by this because I wanted to pop out
the door and yell "TANK COMMANDER!" |, therefore, decided to wait until everyone had exited
and shut the hatch behind me. After waiting five seconds I fulfilled my dream only to see a rather
startled family of four with two small children standing directly in front of me. Tarn explained that I
was from the New World and that we did get off on doing loud stupid stuff. They seemed mollified
by this explanation and moved off through the field.
After this caving trip we went back to the field station, got changed and went to the Hunters. I or-
dered the giant bowl of melted cheese dish which was fabulous and we played shovehaypenny
which is like shuffleboard but smaller and more drunk.
A week and a half after all this went down I drunkenly crawled into Philip Balister's camper at Pic-
nic. He yelled "who the fuck is in my camper?" at which point I began to beat him with a dirty sock.
It's good to be home.
