Tope on the Road (Wheels on the Bus – Raffi)
The wheels on the vibe go,
THUMP THUMP THUMP
THUMP THUMP THUMP
THUMP THUMP THUMP
The wheels on the vibe go
THUMP THUMP THUMP
All through the tope
works.
Jason's singing. I'm not moving, I'm not moving,
Fuck I'm moving and there's only down from
here.
But I did not survive vet school,
To go die falling down a rope.
It's only four-fucking-hundred feet,
Maybe I'll die before I hit the floor.
Cepillo! It's a hairbrush!
And I fall and I stop and I fall and I stop again!
Six bars now! I'm moving faster!
And I fall and I stop and I fall and I stop again.
The tope on the road go
Fuck your shit
Ting Ting THUMP
Fuck your shit
The tope on the road go
Fuck your shit
All through Xilitla
Small Town Perro (Don't Stop Believing – Journey).
Just a small town perro,
Living in a lonely pueblo,
Crossing the street going anywhere.
Looking for a little snack,
But here comes the Poniac,
Maybe he'll look both ways in the afterlife.
Mango (Escape – Rupert Holmes)
If you like pineapple tacos,
Onion and cilantro.
If you can be creative,
And your name is Mango.
It's not bad being vegan,
Eating Avocado.
You can eat so much cheaper,
In Mexico.
A perro up on the techo,
Barking loud to scare the gringos,
He wants to run away to rut,
But there's danger from all of the cane trucks.
Caballos! Streetside! Gatos en el restaurante.
Vacas! Walking on roads in the mountains.
Pollos! Crowing! At 5am in Aquismon.
I wish the dogs would all go get spayed!
Reilly (Anything You Can Do – Annie Get Your
Gun)
Anything you can eat, I can't here!
I can't eat any of the things that you can!
How bout corn?
Fuck yourself
Or Gluten?
Fuck yourself
Vegetables?
Fuck yourself, give me meeeeat
Grazing garbage to get their fill,
Begging tourists, bending wills.
Defending territory at pyramids,
Getting into fights.
Some will win. Some will lose.
Survival of the fittest rules.
Darwin's law reigns supreme tonight,
They roam on and on and on and on.
Cepillo! (500 miles – The Proclaimers).
When I hike up. Yeah I know I gotta breath,
I gotta breath to make it up there to the pit.
It's Cepillo. I can't see the fucking floor,
That probably means that it would kill me if I fall.
It's my first time. On a rack, and on a rack,
It's not zippered but that doesn't mean that it
Caballos! Streetside! Gatos en el restaurante.
Vacas! Walking on roads in the mountains.
Pollos! Crowing! At 5am in Aquismon.
I wish the dogs would all go get spayed!
Look out perro!
