Karma's a Bitch! - A Tawney's story
Nick LaPointe
Yesterday I had my first trip to Tawney's cave. We had Deighan as our fearless leader,
which really meant he let us follow whoever picked a direction and told us we were going
the wrong way before disappearing in another hole. Either that or he's going to show us the
hardest route through the section he's leading just to see if we're naive enough to follow.
Deighan showed us all the interesting parts of the cave and even tried to take us up a
classic Deighan climb to try and find a spot that looks down into the moon room. Three of us
started to follow him up a canyon near the echo chamber only to discover; it's friggin' sketchy.
That, and we don't actually know how to get to the overlook hole. After a good bit of goofing
off in this canyon, we decide we should join the rest of the group back at the bottom of the
climb and move on with the trip.
After spending a couple of hours in the cave, finding the sinkhole entrance, the en-
trance to grim Tawney's, looking at some cave art and hanging out in the moon room for a
while, we started heading out of the cave. As we were leaving, I was following Reilly across a
traverse to avoid the water hazard below us. We were bringing up the rear as everyone else
headed a bit farther to the toilet bowl. It was this traverse that taught me a very important les-
son.
Uncharacteristically, Reilly was struggling to get across the traverse without backtrack-
ing. Meanwhile I'm making fun of her while waiting for her to choose a better path and get
across the traverse. She was less than pleased, as was Tawney's. As soon as I get across the
traverse behind Reilly, I begin to walk, but alas Tawney's decides I don't deserve sure footing.
As I fall backwards I flail to stop myself from tumbling into the stream to no avail. I tumble
backwards into the stream making a nice splash and putting on a spectacular show for Reilly
to watch while she laughs at me. As my boots quickly fill with water I realize I just received in-
stant karma, but Tawney's isn't quite done with me yet.
I'm now drenched to just below my shoulders with a sprained wrist crawling out of a
stream laughing at myself with Reilly watching from dry ground. I try standing up and walk-
ing again once I'm back on dry(ish) ground. I'm soaked and now I have no grip on the sloped
mud that only gets slicker as I move across it. I basically end up rolling myself across the next
short section of mud because I'm too well lubed up to travel in any sort of efficient manner.
After struggling through what should've been an easy walk, I make it to my first real chal-
lenge now that I've hurt my wrist; the toilet bowl climb.
After a few minutes waiting for the others to get up the toilet bowl, it's my turn. It's not
a particularly difficult climb but I don't want to hurt my wrist any more than I already had. So
now I get to learn the art of climbing and canyoning using only one hand. Luckily almost all
of the rest of the cave could be managed with one hand, a well-placed elbow and artful flop
and wiggle combo. Either that or I could walk through some water instead of climbing over it,
a much more appealing option when you're already wet.
We finally get out of the cave with everyone dry except for maybe a few inches above
their shoes and me dripping and making some lovely fart like sounds with every step I take as
we walk back down the slick trail to the road. Still trying to avoid using my wrist, I grab a tree
and decide walking is no longer worth it and I'll just slide down the trail instead. I was already
a mess anyway so who really cares as long as I didn't get a stick up my butt on the ride.
All in all, it was a fun first trip to Tawney's which had some really neat spots in it. But,
the moral of the story is always use 3 points of contact, and much more importantly, don't
make fun of Reilly in Tawney's cuz karma's a bitch!
