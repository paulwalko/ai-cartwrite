The author rappelling into Hill Top Cave - photo courtesy of Bill Grose
At the bottom of the visible extent of the pit, there is a hole into the cave that
chokes and makes communication past that point difficult. I reached the mouth and
expected to begin a free hanging rappel...
... and entered a roughly 45 degree mud slope of a cave. Tyrone and the tape
were at the bottom of the mud slope that is Hill Top Cave, which measured a measly
82 feet from the mouth that I had passed. Thus, the greatest disappointment of Wythe
County was found.
