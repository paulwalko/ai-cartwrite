This obviously describes the patch that we still use to-
day. But, again, no mention is made of it being A.1. Cart-
wright. There seems to be no other mention of the 'model'
John Veitch in any existing records, so that may remain
another mystery.
VPE I
NSS The
The first ever Cave Club Banquet was held in March
1966. The event is described in the Summer 1966 issue of
the Troglodyte. In the write-up by Anne Whittemore, she
mentions that “The Hall was decorated to give a cave at-
mosphere, complete with the Cave Club's own mascot, The
Troglodyte."
At the recent Banquet, in a conversation with Bob Simonds,
he recalls making The Troglodyte (a nearly life size model)
for that first banquet, and he confirmed that at that time it
was only known as 'the hairy ape'.

CLUB
25th Anniversary
Perhaps The Troglodyte would have remained forever unnamed, (and A.I. Cartwright a forgotten bit
of fading history) except for one event. 1968 was the 25th anniversary of the founding of the VPL
Student Grotto, and the Silver Anniversary Edition of The Troglodyte (Winter 1968[3]) was devoted
to that history. And A.I. Cartwright came roaring back to life, bigger than ever.
The editors had spent significant time poring through the early editions of The Grapevine and oth-
er history, and apparently been taken with the idea of the A.1. Cartwright character of the early edi-
tions. Thus the Editor's Column for the anniversary edition was written by the 'Guest Editor' A. I.
Cartwright. A.l. is also mentioned in A True Historie of the club article by Mike Frieders and Bob
Barlow. And there is a reprint of R.C. Caldwell's article from the September 1944 issue of The
Grapevine.
At that point there is still no apparent connection between A.I. Cartwright and The Troglodyte, but
one can imagine that connection would come easily and naturally. However, such things happen
first amongst the members, and only somewhat later, after they have become established lore, is
a passing mention possibly made in a publication such as this.
In the following edition of The Troglodyte (Spring 68) there is a Clover Hollow Trip Report. While it
does not mention A.I. Cartwright, it has the first mention of the Clover Hollow Library I have found
in the written record.
However, in the Spring 1969 article about Banquet, there is this paragraph:
“On a more serious note, the A.1. Cartwright Honorarium, given in recognition of
“continuing interest in, support of, and fellowship with the VPI Cave Club” was given to
John R. Holsinger, Jack Stellmack and Don Cournoyer.”
[3] When the Troglodyte was published on a Quarterly basis, the 'Winter' edition was for the Quar-
ter January thru March. Thus the order for a typical scholastic year would be F67/668/368
