INTRODUCTION
Welcome to the VPI Cave Club, where everyone fits in whether they do or not. We
had a wonderful year full of caving, training, and general absurdity. The Cave Club is
really a grand group of peopleâ€”the kind of group in which old farts and newcomers
can run freely through keg-infested cow fields together in harmony, though some
complain more than others.
I hope this Trog does a decent job of capturing what we as a club do, whether it's
below ground or above. The Cave Club is really an odd but special group full of
rad, kind, and off-the-wall people that I've never found anywhere else.
Here's to another great year! Let's keep the traditions going, the weirdness alive,
and keep on caving on.
