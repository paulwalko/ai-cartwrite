“Figure #1 shows the original helical knot developed by Clarence Cook and Tony
Marchin. Figure #2 shows another tie-off the [Bob] Thrun points out can be adjusted to
take in or take out the appropriate slack. Figure #3 Indicates the probably the most pop-
ular of all tie-offs. While figure #4 shows what the knot looks like when it is load-
ed.” (Nylon Highway, 17:19) The number of loops can be varied from 4 to 10 for more or
less friction. (NSS Intermediate SRT Training Course, 6) The helical has more room for
variability than the prusik which makes it more to use but also more versatile and cus-
tomizable for the user. The number of wraps and the tightness of the wraps can be ad-
justed for more or less friction and easier sliding of the knots on the rope.
The main advantage of the prusik knot is its ease and speed of construction, and simplic-
ity; there is no need to adjust the size of the loops or slack in the knot due to its de-
sign. The knot can be tensioned in both directions while maintaining friction. However,
This simplicity can be a drawback. The knot is not adjustable and the size or tightness of
the loops cannot be adjusted. Because of this, the knot can be difficult to move up the
rope as after it tightens from loading. This can lead to slower climbing times and more
effort required to advance the knots. With the helical knot, the slack in the loops is ad-
justable so the user can adjust to their preferred tightness. For new climbers, this can
cause difficulties because they do not have the experience or knowledge of exactly how
tight or loose to make their knots for maximum climbing efficiency. The increased com-
plexity can also lead to mistakes in tying the knots and longer times to tie in and as-
cend. Helical knots loosen easier than prusiks and can be raised with pressure from the
thumb and forefinger. However, they have the added disadvantage of not being able to
withstand top loaded pressure. (Nylon Highway, 17:20)
Overall, both knots allow ascension in the hands of a properly trained individual. The
prusik is simple and easy to tie but has the disadvantage of less variability and can be-
come difficult to advance after loading. The helical is more difficult to tie but offers more
control over friction and is easy to advance after loading. The prusik has fewer ways to
fail when tying and using it on-rope, while the helical requires a little more skill in its
tying and operation. I would follow Bill Cuddington's advice to teach all trainees to
climb with prusiks first before moving to the helical knot for these reasons.
