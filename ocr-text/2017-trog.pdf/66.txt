Cave Avoidance for Fun or Profit
Dave Hughes, NSS-14550
Several years ago, the famous Scottish mountaineer, Tom Patey spared the climbing world a lot of un-
necessary labor by explaining how to appear to be a great climber without actually climbing. Fortunate-
ly, caving has certain similarities to climbing—akin, some say, to indoor mountaineering. As a result,
Patey’s clever theme is easily adapted to the pale, anemic troglodyte.
It is well known, of course, that there are considerable fringe benefits to being a legitimately great cav-
er—money; muscle cars; fast women. But, no reasoned individual fails to recognize that caving is also
a whole bunch of hard work.
Worse, even a cursory glance underground drills home the heart-throttling reality that caves are dark
and scary places. The fact is, a man could get his bum kicked down there.
To this end, we hereby present a selection of tools, techniques, and methods that should allow the prac-
titioner to masquerade as a speleological hero without actually having to venture underground.
The “Too Much Like Hard Work” Ploy
The is the Virginia caver's favorite gambit when he finds himself butting heads with some Southern
hard-men at a SERA Cave Carnival. Many TAG caves are admittedly a little remote in comparison to,
for instance, Luray Caverns. But, I have heard this sort of generalization directed at the Huntsville area
where one can scarcely leave the main road without falling into a pit. No, this simply will not do! Far
better is to use:
The “Off Form” Ploy
This one is as old as the limestone itself but still is widely employed. Few cavers will ever admit to be-
ing “on form.” Surely, everyone would feel uneasy if they did.
Fortunately, a caver who was “on form” during the morning can be feeling “off form” by early after-
noon. If an interval of 48 hours or so has elapsed between descents, he may talk of being “out of condi-
tion.” If the layoff has been a week or longer, he may justifiably consider himself to be “out of train-
ing.”
The “Bum Lamp” Ploy
Often, it is best to blame an inanimate object for one's troubles. Such a participant will flood his an-
cient carbide lamp at the Waiting Room above Surprise Pit and, then, let the others in the group share
his consternation when the only remaining dry felt is “accidentally” dropped into the abyss.
Unfortunately, some cavers carry such a myriad of spare parts that it is possible to be saddled with a
veritable equipment vendor while feigning such a predicament. To defeat such eventualities, it is best
to rely on an exotic illumination device permanently riveted to one's helmet. Any single failure will
then ensure the safety of non-participation. Suggested examples include a fluorescent lamp controlled
by a Septium VIII microprocessor, a bunch of fireflies in a phosphorescent tube or, perhaps, a pair of
moose antlers painted Day-Glo.
The “Wrong Gear” Ploy
The key to this ploy is to always leave for the “push” trip with completely inappropriate equipment.
"I'm an experienced sump diver” is a fairly safe assertion at Big Bone Cave, where it is unlikely that
you will be called upon to demonstrate your skills.
Such a character will show up for a downstream assault on Ellison's wearing a pair of tennis shoes and
a T-shirt. “Good heavens! The water didn't seem so high on our last push. I'd love to join you guys,
but I demolished my wetsuit in Croatia.”
