good teaching cave, “if people have good upper
body strength,” and has taken several people in
Links as a first-time trip.
Rock climbers, who are used to being in
heightsy situations, may still have a hard
time—the techniques necessary to successfully
navigate Links are very different from those
rock climbers use on a wall. Haden Bricker, a
climber, describes her first time in Links as
“terrifying” but feels that it prepared her for all
her subsequent caves, once she learned how to
use her feet differently. Booker's first-time trip
of climbers had a similar reaction, being
described as “not the biggest fans of not being
able to use their hands and feet... like when
climbing." In summary, climbers should
become acquainted with rule number five and
will subsequently do fine.
Not everyone agrees with these choices: “I
have no fucking idea why some of our
members feel Links is suitable for first-time cavers” (El Presidente, 2016).
Chris Garguilo “usually avoids it,” because on past trips, the canyon has turned first-
timers off from caving altogether. David
DeBarnardis has experienced this as well and
therefore agrees with CGarguilo. Jenn
McGuire has had people get stuck in Links on
their first cave trips (and has been stuck in
there herself, thanks to our glorious leader!),
but continues to take first-time trainees there,
as she feels it is a good teaching cave. Didi
Orndorff went on Links her first time caving
and enjoyed it very much, but one of the
members of her trip got freaked out in a
canyon and had to turn back, and has not been
caving since. As you can see, Links seems to
filter out a certain kind of person--and maybe it
is too effective a filter! So the question is, is
Links a good first cave? In the words of
P Money/Honeybuns/Cash Moneyhun/
*assorted raspberry noises*, “For certain
legendary individuals.” For people in general,
you can't know until you've gone!
