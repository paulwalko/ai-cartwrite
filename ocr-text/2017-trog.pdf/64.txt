in the wall, that if I could straddle out and get my foot in-
to, I would be in the home stretch. I am not going to lie,
rock climbing over the past few months helped out. There
was also a spot where I was able to do a comfortable fist
jam, and swing myself out. Then at the point, I asked for
some slack and inched my way over into virgin borehole
in windy mouth! By virgin borehole, I mean I was standing
in a 10-ft. tall, 10 ft. wide passage, with a shelf to the left of
me. I set up a stainless-steel bolt in (after more trouble
finding) good rock, and made a traverse line back to the
main line. This also used the rest of my 2nd drill battery
up. Joe then took me off belay and I went down passage
for about 30 ft. to a turn that went left and then it started
to get tight and canyon like again. It could be short lived,
it could go on for 1000' feet to another dome, or it could
get to tight! Guess we will have to find out next time.
I came back to the traverse line and to the main bolt, fixed
the traverse line, and then rappelled down. Joe then went
up and partially cleaned the route. We all decided to pack
up, and move the bolting gear that we planned on leaving
in the cave back to the 1st dome for next time. This was a
good decision because we were able to cave out of the
fun 1000 feet of canyon crawling with 3 packs instead of 4,
and this time it only took 1.5 hours instead of 2! It was al-
so downhill which was nice. All in all, we exited the cave,
sore and bruised but not too cold, to a full moon right
around 10 pm, giving us a solid 12.5-hour trip.
Next time we go back, first thing is to set a better permanent rig at the top of the 20 feet dome. It
works but, if that passage goes, it needs a second bolt for a true y-hang rig once that's done, Kelly
plans on leading a team to start surveying that passage, while Joe and I go back to the 40-foot
dome and start working on that. As for the actual L survey - once Tommy Polson gets back from
Mexico I want to take a look at the old survey notes to see how detailed (if at all) they are. If we
deem them worthy - screw it, we will use the old data and not resur-
vey that section of the cave. Below I have spliced in the Old Hixson
Survey data of the L survey to show you were its going, where the
domes are, and what I think they might do. It's rare that I write this de
tailed of a trip report, but we all had a great time this weekend and its
always exciting to find new passage in a cave, even if you have to fight
for every bit of it.
