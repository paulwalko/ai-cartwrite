A Brief Plug for the VSS
by Mike Futrell
The Virginia Speleological Survey (VSS) is a small non-profit organization that maintains rec-
ords of the State's caves. While watching Andrew Lycas' presentation on Wythe County cave
surveys, I thought, “This is how the VSS was envisioned to operate - a leader/facilitator and a
bunch of participants."
The VSS does not have memberships, rather it has a small group of directors, usually about
two dozen, who form the organization. These folks primarily fill the role of County Directors.
The idea is that each county director would coordinate and promote exploration and survey in
their respective counties. Generally the county director is someone who has been around a
while and has a keen interest in organizing mapping projects in a particular county. We loose-
ly think of these as 'county projects', though we occasionally have smaller regional projects.
The Wilburn-Sugar Run Project is/was a good example. Slightly different is the BCCS, which is
its own organization that sends a representative director and shares data.
Some projects organize periodic survey events. For a time Nathan Farrar held the Page County
survey one weekend a month. Ben Schwartz has been holding a two week camp and cave
event in Wise County each summer for some time now. Ficco and Futrell seem to be in Taze-
well every other weekend. However, for the most part, it's occasional weekends as organized
by whomever has the time. This ranges from several trips a month to a trip or two a year.
True, some counties have no director. Generally, this is because no one is currently focusing
on the area. This doesn't mean there is nothing going on, just that it may be sporadic. For ex-
ample, in the case of Roanoke County it's because the county is generally thought to be
“finished" and there's probably no point in having a director for the county.
Back in the pre-digital days cave research meant perusing the paper archives for information
subsequent to the Douglas and Holsinger books. These days most of the records are digital,
though we still have a lot of paper files remaining to be scanned. Still the process for one
wanting to start or join a project is to contact the county director for the area, or alternatively
talk to one of the long time cave surveyors for guidance.
If you want a project, we'll help you find one (or two).
