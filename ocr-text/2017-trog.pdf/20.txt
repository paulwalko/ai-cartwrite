GROTTO GRAPEVINE
At a WVACS work weekend, someone made the mistake - or was it - of playing Celine
Dion's "My Heart Will Go On" and we all got to witness Nick Socky go into heat.
Ever intrigued by words, Jonathan Roberts: Local Guy With an English Degree, looked
into the vernacular of cavers in an at-
tempt to figure out why we all keep go-
ing underground even though we're ful-
ly aware sometimes it's really unpleas-
ant. His findings were fascinating. We
use words like, "sporting," and "grim,"
when we mean â€œIt's the worst thing I've
ever done, other than proposing to my
fifth wife." It was determined that words
used to describe the same passage
change drastically when it comes to in-
viting folks on our trips vs how we write
the trip report. For example, one might
recall that
The Meat Grinder in New River Cave is pretty lame. Pre-trip
scriptions are composed primarily of profanity. After
conducting a series of tests and spending hours studying the
ways cavers speak, he discovered that we're a bunch of liars.
Someone brought a box of erasable pens to sign-out, so you
can finally remove someone from your trip without it being
super obvious! The timing was perfect, since not a day earlier,
Dan Crowder had locked the keys to the gearbox in the gear-
box, leaving us unable to outfit trainees with the proper equip-
ment. Make people think you cave safely, use an erasable
pen! Thanks for helping us maintain our reputation,
whoever purchased those.
For those who have been out of touch with our abroad
friend (who, to clarify, is not a broad), Matthew Skowron-
ski has found his calling as a full-time hippie by starting a
healthy vegan chocolate shop at the yoga
studio he works and lives at. Ever the punster, he has
590,
working with a local Thai artist who does detailed resin
castings and traditional cultural paintings, where he
exchanges English lessons to learn how to make
sculptures as well as silicone molds so he can make
chocolates in "spiritual shapes like chakras, or flowers or
whatever else yoga people can't get enough of."
