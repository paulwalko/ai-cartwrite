And so, after about a two hours of this exceeding sporting cave,
it just opens up suddenly into a large room 30 ft. by 30 ft. room
with 40 ft. dome, at the top of the dome you can see the con-
tact ceiling and going passage as well. Even better bonus is this
area is very dry and comfortable. Catch- about 15 ft. off the
ground you hit a layer of crappy rock for about 7 ft. We will
cross that bridge when we get there. But this was the first dome.
If you keep following the passage forward (only just about 100
to 200 more feet of not too horrible crawling), you come to the
2nd 20-foot dome!
This dome was ideal for our first bolt climbing experience (yes
this was our first time every doing this by ourselves). We had
good rock for the first 10 feet and it was at a near vertical slope
(75 to 80 degrees?) and out of the
waterfall. there was a 5-ft. section
of bad rock, but it was nearly at the
same level as the lead so we could
set up a traverse line over to where
the water was coming from if we
could just find some good rock
where the crappy layer was.
Anyways, we laid out all our gear
drank some water, and went to re-
fill and then use my iodine tablets so we had more water.... SHIT. I had
forgotten my tablets on the surface and knew exactly where I had put
them. Luckily, we still had plenty of water for the three of us, but we
were not long going to be able to do a 16-hour trip. Slightly dismayed
but still motivated, we got to work bolting. Kelly set the first bolt, and
| set the 2nd one. I then came down, and Joe proceeded to work his
way up setting the next two. As Joe was working and I was belaying,
Kelly was surveying the room- the LA survey: all 50' feet of splay shots
wooh!
Joe was working on trying to set a
| bolt in the crappy layer of rock and
had trouble finding a good spot for to but it. After finding a little
bit of good rock, Joe broke a bolt from over tightening it (we were
learning), and then he started to get tired so it was my turn back
up. I set another bolt and got a bit higher up and went to set an-
other. As Joe had found out that the rock was really crappy, so did
1. The 2nd bolt I set, was put in crappy rock and was wiggling
around making me wildly uncomfortable, and annoyed- it was
supposed to be a stainless-steel anchor before I set the traverse
line up. So, I dug and tapped around some more until I found
some good rock, and set the bolt. Even though that one didn't
break, it still made me nervous because of the rock and relative
location to the bad bolt, but it would have to do. Next was dig-
ging deep, clinching hard, and climbing out over the ledge to get
up to the waterfall and the traverse.
It should be noted that Kelly had finished surveying the room, and
had whipped out a candle and trash bag and was quite content
with watching me spider man out across the rock face. My first try
attempt | spooked myself a bit because I started to slip, so I
backed up and tried to get a better look. Then I saw a small crack
