My First Caving Experience with the VPI Cave Club to New River Cave
By: Nicholas Polidoro
The day was bright and sunny, with a cool fall breeze. We had just arrived at a “parking spot”
just off the road about 100m from the mighty New River. The lack of anything that looked like a
hole in the ground we could even feasibly get into worried me slightly; but I was assured other-
wise. After getting changed, my friend and I followed the members who were leading the trip up
the hill... along with the thirteen other newbies; little did I know this was a lot of people for a
caving trip. By the time we got to the top, half of the newbies were winded and not even sure
why they signed up for this trip in the first place. Nevertheless, the view was astounding and pic-
ture-perfect. After a short safety speech and information on the 10% rule, we were ready to enter
the cave.

Lights on and helmets
checked on the low hanging
ceiling, we began our descent
into the darkness. While I
had been in cave's before,
they were strictly commercial
and really well lit up, so this
was a very different and ex-
citing experience for me. We
came to the first room and all
signed into the PVC pipe pro-
tected log book. Next we pro-
ceeded to turn off all of the
lights and actually experi-
ence what is was like to be a
local creature of the dark.

The trips plan was to make it to the forest room and back without getting too lost. Needless to say,
only one managed to happen. The cave was surprisingly large and impressive with its extremely
tall passageways. It almost felt surreal. Continuing our track, we suddenly took a sharp turn to a
new room that was elegantly named the BFR. Next, we ven-
tured to the forest room but not without problem. Many of
the newbies were scared of heights and not very comfortable
with climbing techniques. So this took close to an hour to get
everyone into the forest room, and another 20-30 minutes to
get back out. This was by far the longest part of the trip with
a lot of waiting around. At least we had the forest room to
admire in the spare time. We then just followed the path we
came in from (mostly) and left the cave with an impressive
100% return rate and no injuries.

Finally, after a few hours underground we came back out
into the light. I felt like hermit emerging from a bunker after
living underground for a few years where the sunlight hurt
my eyes. Nevertheless, I was hooked on caving. After walk-
ing back down the trail and getting changed, we headed
back to campus where I told all friends how fun and FREE it
was to try. Ever since I've been caving at least a few times a
month on both horizontal and vertical trips.
