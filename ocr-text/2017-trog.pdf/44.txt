On Links and Trainees (first time caving!!)
By Reilly Blackwell
Links cave is located at the Bat Ranch, and is a fun
little trip. It contains the most technical sections of
any cave in our immediate area, including several
passages canyoning without much visible floor.
Links is popular for techniques trips, the most
educational of all trips, due to its dryness and the
fact that a capable caver can make it through in
under half an hour. As I spoke to more and more
cavers, I found that many people's first cave was
either Links or New River, which has led me to the
conclusion that there are two types of people. I fall
into the former category—I went to Links as my
first cave, in August 2016. I only almost-died 5 or so
times and have been caving ever since, inspired to
continue by the rewarding feeling of making it
through challenge after challenge.
Links has some fun parts, some parts that get fun
once you know how to do them, and some parts that
I'm pretty sure will never be fun. The Hobbyhorse, where you must straddle a rock with a
lot of exposure and scoot over it, is the last sort; my memories of navigating it are mostly
blanked out by terror, but I'm kind of a wimp about heights. The Nasty, a demanding
canyoning passage, is technically difficult, but very
satisfying to complete. The Bucket Climb is a popular
Elementary Climbing sign-off spot, which I got through
very ungracefully by using a human as the “bucket.”
There is, of course, the spot where an unfortunate visitor
had to be blasted out after getting stuck. This provides a
good teaching moment as well, as the image of me
surrounded by exploding rock and heckling cavers
provided me with plentiful motivation to never get badly
stuck in a cave.
Although the trip was difficult, since I was in bad shape,
very scared of heights, wearing a very slippery jacket,
and had nonfunctional hands, it prepared me for all the
caves I've been in since. I was told that in the realm of
horizontal caving, “If you can do Links you can do
anything,” and that rule has held true, giving me the
confidence to tackle other caves without fear. This
impression is echoed by Skippy the Wonder Pig (Will
Borin), who also went to Links on his first day caving.
He has said that it similarly made him feel like he could
do any other cave he wished. TPO agrees that it is a
