How I Lost My Virginity in a Cave
A short story by: Skippy the Wonder Pig
I guess you could say I was rule follower in high school. Tended to keep to myself. I was on the
wrestling team if that means anything to you. I was the only one from my high school that
came to Virginia Tech so I was looking forward to a fresh start. Well, week one I got sucked
into this thing called the Cave Club, and it was great. The people are super inclusive and fun
and different. For instance, this one caver is so into vertical caving that he insists on using the
vertical menu over the horizontal menu at IHOP because, “vertical is just superior in every
way, shape, and form." I
quickly learned that the
Cave Club is so much
more than just caving. I
also realized that I
brought the average age
of the club down. Way
down. As a matter of
fact, I am the youngest
person in the club. As
time went on, one of the
older and rather aggres-
sive members of the club
started to talk to me
about going to Links
Cave together for a 'sport
trip.' It sounded fun, I like
sporty things. They may
have thrown some other
terms out there like
“techniques trip" and "trip for two" but I really needed to work on my technique because
caving was still very new to me and of course it was going to be trip for two... no one else was
coming. The week leading up to the trip I kept texting my fellow caver and telling them how
excited I was for this 'trip for two.' I told them!
was so excited that I wanted to bring my GoPro
to film everything. I didn't really understand
why they were so hesitant about me bringing it
but eventually they said it would probably be a
good idea so we can watch everything we do
later. The day finally came to go caving. It all
happened so fast. I mean it didn't seem too
ridiculous that the best way to work on
technique is to run through the cave naked.
But then we got to the wedding room. When
you don't know where you are or how to get
out it's hard to get out. Probably due to the
implication.
