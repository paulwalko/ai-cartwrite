FLOAT TRIP
The weather was perfect for Float Trip.
There was a handful of smaller floats
instead of one large one, and a
singular kayak that held an individual
with a wonky knee. The water carried
the merry band of floaters down the
New River to the take-out point where
they adjourned their trip and headed
back to the Bat Ranch to spend some
time with those Jersey cavers who
came down for the event.
