Friday-Saturday, March 17-18, 2017
Perkins Cave, Washington County, VA
Janet Manning
(In alphabetical order) Eric Cueva,
Bill Grose, Jason Lachniet, Janet Man-
ning, Amy Skowronski, Caleb Taylor,
and Zach Taylor entered the cave on
Friday evening around 5:30pm. After
everyone was signed into the log-
book near the gated entrance, the
first team (composed of Jason Lach-
niet, Janet Manning, Caleb and Zach
Taylor) took the high route, with the
plan of meeting the second team
(composed of Eric Cueva, Bill Grose,
and Amy Skowronski) in the canyons below the Tight Place in the Dirty Old Men section
of the cave, where both teams would survey. The second team was only half an hour be-
hind the first, despite traveling through the scenic Forest Trail, First and Second Discov-
ery, and the various crawls. Both teams got to enjoy a small portion of the cave featuring
unavoidable, exceptionally stab-prone popcorn - splendid!

to the right and Team 2 went to the left. Our (Team
2) survey led us through a canyon with a handful
of nice formations and brought us to a junction. As
we worked on the lead to the right, Bill waxed po-
etic about reading instruments from poorly placed
stations and as he wrote 'DOM 14' on a piece of
flagging tape and tied it around a rock said, "Man,
the guy setting stations really doesn't know what
he's doing." before chortling heartily at his own
joke. We killed the right-hand lead and headed
back to the junction.
We decided that the down climb at the end of the
left-hand lead couldn't be free-climbed and carried
on down the canyon passage. Surveying was going
quite smoothly, front sights and back sights were
matching, and Bill gave us some great tips about
how to accurately get measurements from a station
placed on a wall: "Be a flounder!" Thanks, Bill. We
found a nice little loop, but part of it would require
