Doing It Vertically
By Skylar Hopkins
On 4 February 2017, SHopkins went to Clover Hollow and lost her vertical innocence to a
horde of eager virtue-eaters: JClifford, JMcGuire, ASkowronski, DConroy, EHahn, and
RBlackwell. Trainees WBorin and ESteinberg watched and helped as necessary. What
follows is a brief account of the sordid affair:
Upon embarking on their adventure, The Party found that the cave entrance was shock-
ingly dry. No splooshing in sight. But contrary to popular opinion, dry caving is nice. You
should try it.
After their initial entrance and a bit of poking around in a tight place, The Party found
that someone else had been screwing in the cave, and they had left an unsightly mess.
Some awkward straddling ensued. JClifford watched and sometimes assisted while the
shortest cavers did sketchy things. SHopkins liked that so much that she requested that
he do it again later.
Soon after, the cave became a bit deeper – just deep enough that more protection was
required. But The Party discovered that JMcGuire had left some of the extra protection
at her house. D’oh! Fortunately, JDeighan appeared in spirit with a stiff and crusty
surprise. The Party continued, feeling only slightly debased. But first, JClifford – who
was taking up the rear, as he does – took an extra moment to show SHopkins and
ESteinberg how to make safety and body friction sexy.
Before long, a very exciting game of “Two Girls, One Hole” began. DConroy and
ASkowronski held hands while things got really deep. All voyeurs agreed that it was an
intense and romantic moment. Before SHopkins and JMcGuire followed suit, JClifford
checked SHopkins out. A lot. Especially her crotch. After she was declared suitable,
SHopkins went deep amidst many cheers. She blushed furiously while photos were taken.
But caving isn't all about going deep. You need
to go down and up. So WBorin and EHahn
pleased the cave by going in and out many
times, while JClifford and DConroy reminded
the men to pace themselves. Spending yourself
too soon is frowned upon.
RBlackwell offered to get up with SHopkins,
promising to go slow because it was SHopkins'
first time. Despite going slow, there was a
somewhat worrisome moment where protection
malfunctioned, but fortunately no embarrass-
ing accidents resulted. Some extra rope weight
fixed the problem, and SHopkins had the op-
portunity to experience extreme crotch friction.
Mmm, burny.
The rest of the affair was what you might ex-
pect, with just one important detail worth not-
ing: ASkowronski told JClifford that she never
