BATS AND BEDROCK EXTRAVAGANZA
At the end of 2016, a group of intrepid
explorers headed to Wythe County for a
week of surveying in the abundant, albe-
it small, caves in the area. The week
was dubbed the Bats and Bedrock
Extravaganza, purely so the acronym
would be BABE. Tight squeezes were
pushed, horses helped read maps, and
Horace ended up in some dangerous
situations. Thank you to Bill Grose for
talking to landowners, getting cave
locations, and being excited about the
survey!
