Dreaming of Cave Adventures in Myanmar
by Mike Futrell
We have wanted to go on a cave expedition to Myanmar for years. Maybe it just
sounded exotic, a mysterious country that has been closed to the world for years.
Maybe it was the large areas of limestone unseen by western cavers. Maybe we just
had too many empty survey books.
We had caved a lot in China, but also in Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia. South-east
Asia is such a wonderful part of the world. What better way to see a country than
spend as much time as possible underground?
Of course, some things are easier said than done. We had visited Myanmar with a
Lonely Planet book back in 2002 as the country was just opening up to tourists. Mount-
ing an expedition was another thing entirely and we forgot the idea as we devel-
oped a keen interest in the caves of China. Fast forward to 2016. A British and Europe-
an team each had been running an expedition to Myanmar for about 7 years and
have formed an organization to facilitate international collaboration amongst cavers
with an interest in the country â€“ Myanmar Cave Documentation Project, http://
www.myanmarcaves.com
We are friends with several participants in these projects and have been discussing
an interest for a number of years. And we might be able to find the time and money
for such a trip. Fortunately we were able to attend EuroSpeleo'16 in August and sit
down with many of these folks to discuss possibilities.
Now that the dream was becoming a reality we had some serious planning to do.
Were we up on all our shots? Do they have malaria there? Do we need any new
cave or travel gear? Thus we set to reading previous expedition reports and reading
up on the country. Our British friend, Pete, applied for official permits and made ar-
rangements for in-country travel, guide/translator, and accommodations.
One thing left. Where are these caves we want to explore? Where exactly do we
want to go? Like all places there's no list of undiscovered caves. Furthermore, there's
not much in the way of available geologic mapping. Yet we need to be able to point
at a spot on a map and say take us here. But first we have to create the map!
Google Earth to the rescue!
We all spent a LOT of time flying around in Google Earth looking for potential cave ar-
eas, disappearing streams, big springs, and sinkhole pocked plateaus. Here it really
helps to recognize geomorphology of karst terranes. I generated 1:50,000 topo maps
with SRTM and ASTER surface models and pulled together a number of GIS data
sources. We now had maps and places to go.
Next up, find someone to feed the cats, buy a plane ticket, tell work we may never
come back; and we're off. To be continued.
