A Shakesbeerian Poem
By Nick Socky
To drink, or not to drink. That is the question. For if
thou consumed thine blessed liquid, alas. I cannot cave.
And not to cave is to die! To live, to die, to cave....how
simple, yet complex, this
existential conundrum is.
Hurtling us towards our
own demise, upon this
bedding plane of our own
addictions. To live, to cave,
to drink. Forever, caught in
this cycle in which one day
we will hopefully find that
borehole of our dreams
floating down that
subterranean river of beer,
Drifting softly into an
unknowing bliss of peace
and freedom, at long last detached from the wretched
surface world of sobriety and sunlight. To cave. To
drink. There is no question.
