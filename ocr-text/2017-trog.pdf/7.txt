LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT
Dear Cave Club,
I'd like to tell a story. This summer, I was on a surveying trip in Fallen Rock Cave. We
spent a lot of time in passage that was everything you could hope for – walking size (sometimes
enormously so), wind in your face, a big stream not far away, and, most importantly of all, new to
me. As with most caves, it was dark, wet, cold, and it fascinated me. When I'm caving, the spaces
convey a sense of geologic time that is almost impossible to wrap my head around. It would be
hard to find a more striking contrast to day-to-day life. The word I often use to convey this feeling
is ‘alien.' The environment underground is just so far removed from every common reference point
that it may as well be another planet altogether. That's the mindset I try to capture whenever I'm
caving, and it's why this trip stood out. We reached the end of our survey, but not the end of the
cave, turned around, and left. When we got out, I felt the same way that I usually would under-
ground. We were walking through a field – very short grass, but every few feet was a tall sprout
that came up almost to our waists. The sun was so low that the sky was starting to turn red. The
moon was out. Against this backdrop, the other cavers walked ahead of me. They were covered
from head to toe in bulky, colorful gear stained brown with mud. There wasn't another creature in
sight, despite the open landscape. The scene could have been pulled straight from a campy sci-fi.
Explorers on a brave new world. It was surreal.
There have been a lot of great trips the last four years.
Thanks everyone.
Sincerely,
Tommy Cleckner
