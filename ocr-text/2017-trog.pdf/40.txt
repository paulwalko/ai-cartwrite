Screwing around in the UK
Daniel Crowder
It was a dark and stormy night as we made our way slowly across the English channel and back into
the English speaking world. I was particularly excited for that stage of travel as we had been about
nine weeks in Spanish, French and Catalan speaking regions. Due to the relatively taciturn nature of
my wife Ellen I was largely in charge of the communication aspects of the trip, this is generally true
in the English speaking world as well but I digress. We disembarked from the ferry to the welcom-
ing car of our dear friend Tarn Stroud. Some of you may remember her as the person who taught
us the games of the body traverse and the pass the webbing around two people standing on a fry-
ing pan. She took us back to her apartment in Dorchester and we visited for a couple of days going
to Corfe Castle, the Cerne Abbas Giant and other places of intrigue before setting off on a road trip
to Wales. The drive out to Wales involved going through the port at Bristol and into Newport. As
we crossed the bridge Tarn switched the radio to a Welsh station and much to my chagrin I real-
ized we were going back into a place where I would be lost at sea linguistically. These people spell
bus stop Bws Stop for God's sake. Needless to say the cave we were doing the next day was called
Ogof Ffynnon Ddu (ask me how to pronounce it at the Pub sometime).
The caves in this part of Wales were a bit colder than ours here in western
Virginia. The particular cave we visited on that day made up for this by be-
ing wet. We started at the Cwm Dwr entrance high up in the sheep pad-
dock and exited the cave by another improbably named entrance further
down the hill. On our way in we hit some nice phreatic passage that was
mostly dry and not too crawly. We generally trended down in fairly big pas-
sage until we hit a phreatic section of the cave with a large amount of run-
ning water. Getting into this passage required a nasty down climb which
involved Ellen losing a foothold and kerplunking into the creek. It is safe to
assume that from this point forward Ellen was of a generally grouchy disposition. I would like to
take an aside and say that the furry suits that the Brits use are really nice for wet passage though.
Ever thought you needed a wetsuit but then thought that it would be too much for what you were
doing? Well the furry suit is an adult onesie with neoprene cuffs. It is made out of fleece and
doesn't retain water. Think Peppy's waffle suit but less dumb because it isn't on Peppy.
In our glorious furry suits we made our
way down the roaring stream passage. I
stopped to wait for and check on grumpy
Ellen at one point which turned out to be
a grave mistake. As I started caving again
I noticed a that I had lost the group. The
next thing I noticed was that I was under
water. I thought to myself, â€œself this is real-
ly annoying." After surfacing I asked the
British Cavers about this but all they had
to say was "oh did you find one of the
midget traps then?" The rest of the stream
passage was spent gracefully diving into
these traps to try and hit the other side
before going underwater fully. Never let
them tell you that Her Majesty's subjects
don't strictly adhere to rule five.
After caving along in this manner for some time we climbed back up to the phreatic stuff. Ellen was
ready to go having already eaten her requisite Cadbury bar and after a small amount of delibera-
tion at a crossroads we were free to go to the pub. It should be noted that I had a harder time or-
dering a Guinness from a Welsh publican than a French one, C'est la vie.
