• Snack – Trail mix, Snickers bar, Cliff bar, pre-cooked bacon. Bring something to keep your en-
ergy up.
• Pack – Something small and durable to carry all your stuff in. Draw string gym bags will usually
get shredded within the first trip; ask if the trip leader or grotto has any spare bags.
Step 3: This is great! Where can I get my own gear?
At some point your new cave buddies are going to need
their gear back, so now you get to start picking out your
own gear. Yay! But where do you start? What should
you buy first? Where do you find it? What do you look
for? So many questions. Here are a few suggestions to
get you started.
• First things first - Gear can get expensive. So if
you're budgeting out what equipment to get when,
Here's a good general order
• Helmet: Usually found for around $40-$60. You
need a helmet for any trip you do, so it's a solid first
step into your own set of cave gear.
• Lights: Along with the helmet, lights are some-
thing you're going to need on every trip and won't
cost you too much to get started. Decent starter lights are around $15-$25
• Clothes: If you go on more than 1 or 2 trips, you're going to want some dedicated cave
clothes. Very cheap, usually under $20.
• Pack: Having your pack rip open and dump all your stuff out halfway through the cave is
pretty awkward. If you're still using that free gym back, you may want to think about upgrading
to something a bit more durable. Decent bags can be found for around $20.
• Vertical Gear (optional): If you're in an area where vertical caving trips are available, you can
get started without having to spend too much on fancy rigs. A set of knots, a locking carabiner,
figure 8, and 25%-30' of webbing for a seat harness will run around $35.
• Take my Money! - I just got my student loan refund. Quick, where can i buy this stuff?
• Club Store – VPI has a club store for beginning vertical gear. Check if your grotto has some-
thing similar.
• Old cavers - The more experienced cavers tend to have large collections of gear. From time to
time, they will sort through their horde and sell/give things away to new cavers.
• Army Surplus - packs and clothes. More expensive than Goodwill, but more durable
• Goodwill/YMCA/Thrift Store - Great for finding caving clothes and other interesting accesso-
ries
