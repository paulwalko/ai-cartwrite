LETTER FROM THE EDITOR
Good Afternoon, VPI Cave Club,
Thank you to everyone who submitted articles and let me use pictures they took to make
this year's Trog. Reading all the wonderful articles and editing this thing was a wonderful
way to spend my time when I wasn't busy getting stuck at the bottom of climbs I shouldn't
have attempted or in tight squeezes I didn't want to go down in the first place. And (as al-
ways) thanks to everyone for making this filthy, ragtag community one of the best ones out
there. Cave on, you intrepid weirdos. I hope you enjoy this year's Trog!
Respectfully Submitted,
Amy Skowronski
