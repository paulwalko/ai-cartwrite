Met Grotto Dig
By Andrew Lycas
Saturday November 5, 2016
A group of 12 cavers, including three VPI cavers, Jeramie Clifford, Jason Sargent, and
Andrew Lycas arrived at one of many entrances to a long NY cave system at 10:30
pm. The original intention was to do a couple hour through trip through a portion of this
cave, however there was trouble at the entrance.
As with many trips, it was difficult to first find the entrance. With the hole found, the
group cleared away debris, and found this entrance was blocked and was not the
route our trip leader had thought it was. After a few more minutes of searching, the
proper entrance was found, but the proper digging tools were not brought to clear the
debris in front of this entrance. It was decided to instead do a out and back trip from
the other entrance we were previously going to exit.
Once arriving at the new entrance, the cavers discovered that our entrance into the
system from here was going to be much easier than expected. In the past, cavers had
been required to do a 200 ft crawl to clear out the larger walking entrance from the
back, but this time the group discovered that a few pieces of wood had to be moved
out of the way to open up the walking entrance. The group entered the cave which
starts out with a room roughly 15x15' large with a small entrance hole in the top that
more experienced cavers were talking about rappeling down from in the past.
From this room the cavers needed to
do a short 10' climb down into the bore
hole. The passage itself was 6'x 8',
with a fairly smooth dirt/rock floor.
Where we dropped in, there were two
leads, and the leader of the trip said we
were going in the dowhhill direction.
With that guidance the team walked
down the bore.
The passage itself was fairly non de-
script. There were markings of explor-
ers past, some as late as the 1840s!
Since the cave itself is fairly close to
the surface, probably only 20-30' of
overburden, there was more plant life
in this cave than I am normally used to.
We walked about half a mile until the
passage stops very abruptly. The old
timers on the trip reminisced that you
could at one time keep going down this
passage, but it has since filled in and
you can no longer get through. It was
at this point we helped out with a small
