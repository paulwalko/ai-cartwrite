"You're doing that? AGAIN? We did that twenty years ago‚Äù, they'll remark. And
you'll smirk.
Fortunately for this new generation of cave explorers, low-hanging fruit never
before seen in a light better than carbide is rarely the whole story. Re-survey
projects often yield new passage, sometimes miles of it in larger systems.
Thanks to our ancestors fortunate, and all-too-familiar laziness, a new genera-
tion has the chance to make their own stories.
Just as last year's cavers have their stories of pits dropping into virgin, bore hole
passage, this new crop of explorers will have their own. In a few years we can
regale the new lot of cavers about grim, barely passable stream passage and
sketchy bolt climbs that led to the most amazing passage.
An amazing act borne from futility,
we will always love the re-survey.
Once our hoveled bodies are too
weak to sleep on the ground and
our generation has taken to
purchasing campers too, a new
crop will be drinking Beast while
making plans to do it all once
more.
