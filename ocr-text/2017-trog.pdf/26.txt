So You Want to be a Caver: a primer for trainees
Jason Sargent
This is intended to be a general guide for new cavers on planning, preparing, and gearing up for cave
trips. If you're not sure what you need or where to find your next piece of gear, this should help you
out. Every caver does it a little different, though, so feel free to adjust the suggestions below as you
get a better feel for what you like and want to have with you in a cave. Ask other members about
their gear. Cavers can usually be relied on to have strong opinions on gear, brands, pack lists, and
many other things.
Step 1: How do I go caving?
You've never been caving before or maybe you've been to a commercial cave and now you want to
get underground. If you're in the Blacksburg area, the VPI Cave Club meets during the school year Fri-
days at 7pm in Smythe Hall room 146. Meetings are open to the public, so you can still go caving,
even if you are not a VT student. If you are not fortunate enough to live in the Blacksburg area, try
searching for Grottos (groups of cavers) in your area. The NSS (US National organization for cavers)
has a great list of grottos by location at http://www.nssio.org/Find Grotto.cfm
Step 2: I found a cave trip. Now what?
You've managed to convince/bribe a group of experienced cavers
willing to take you somewhere, great! Always ask someone famil-
iar with the cave what to expect and/or bring. Conditions can vary
greatly between caves. That said, here are some basics you should
always take with you when preparing for a cave trip:
• Change of Clothes & a trash bag - When you come out of the
cave, you will usually emerge looking like something between Pig-
Pen from Peanuts and walking pile of mud. Having a clean-ish set
of clothes to change into will make you feel more like a human and
also get you a ride back to town. Forgetting to bring a change of
clothes may result in having to ride back to town wearing a trash bag (shame burrito). The clothes
you plan to cave in should be long sleeve, rough, durable, and things you won't miss if they get
damaged. Non-cotton material such as polyester/polypropylene (UnderArmor/thermal layers) is
usually recommended, but ask the trip leader; sometimes a t-shirt and jeans can be fine.
• Helmet - Most grottos have a few spares to loan new cavers, so you don't have to go buy gear
right away.
• Light - You should always
have at least 3 sources of
light. As with the helmets, most
cavers have a few spares to loan
for beginners, but it's always a
good idea to bring spare batter-
ies.
• Water - The amount depends
on the length of your trip, but
you should always plan to bring
about a liter of water. Gatorade/
soda bottles work fine.
