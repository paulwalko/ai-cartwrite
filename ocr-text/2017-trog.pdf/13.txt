OLD TIMERS REUNION
Old Timers Reunion was a blast.
Captain Ed kept the coffee flowing
every morning, Dave C's pizzas were
fabulous, the McCarter family made a
surprise appearance, and Steph Petri
Like The Dish bought an actual sword.
VPI had a great showing in the
Speleolympics (well done, everyone!)
and a new annual tradition was
born - the crawling competition.
