BANQUET
A.I. CARTWRIGHT
Pre-Banquet was held at the Futrell
residence, where merriment was had
until late into the night. At Banquet
itself, everyone was dressed to the
nines and looking sharp - not a single
pair of jorts was seen!
Congratulations to Richard Cobb for
receiving the A. I. Cartwright Award
and to Reilly Blackwell for receiving
the BAT.
A nice half hour for mingling post-
awards was had before everyone hit
the dancefloor for the remainder of
the night.
On Sunday, the Redders provided
food and drink for a post-banquet
brunch that turned into dinner - thank
Peso
you!
