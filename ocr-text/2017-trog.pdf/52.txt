Surveying Hill Top Cave
Jenn McGuire
Just two days after Christmas this past year, cave club members and trainees drove
down to Wythe County to make the Great Surveying Push of Winter 2016, in the style
of Filthy Young Women. My car arrived at Bill Grose's house only half an hour after we
were supposed to - right on caver time. Teams assembled themselves, and I, with fresh
new sketching skills, joined Jonathan Roberts and Kristy McCord in choosing Hill Top
cave for exploration, with the promise of vertical caving. Tyrone Phillips caught wind
of the possibility of rappelling into a cave and rounded out our survey team. And so be-
gan our journey to Hill Top.... after a good long wait while everyone else sorted them-
selves out. Much coffee was consumed, many topographical maps were examined, and
confusion was had. At long last, our journey began, as we caravanned along the county
roads to the nearby caves. Well, we were last in the route, it turned out, so we mean-
dered along until we finally made it to our turn off. And so we parked and began the
hike through the fields and brambles to our cave.

Suiting up for cave exploration!
Bill led us to the cave entrance, and we began the rigging into an unknown pit.
Excitement built as we put our vertical gear on for the rappel. Tyrone got ready to rap-
pel in first, and took the end of the survey tape we had brought. He disappeared into
the mouth of the cave and our ability to communicate clearly ends abruptly, but we
saw the tape feed out... and out... and out! At nearly 100 feet the tape stops, and we are
forced to assume
Tyrone is at the bottom of the largest pit in Wythe County! Our excitement was palpa-
ble, and Bill is over the moon. As we heard a muffled off rope, Kristy got on rope and
was soon rappelling down into Hill Top Cave. Soon, Jonathan followed Kristy down
after determining the rappel was clear. Finally, after waiting for the the first three, my
turn arrived! I promised Bill a detailed report when we arrive back at his place, and I
began the descent.
