The character of A.l. continues to evolve, and in the 5th issue of the Grapevine (March 17, 1944)
we find Chapter 1 of his biography (Chapter 2 was either never written, or was in one of several
issues that are missing from the records). This biography, written by E.F. Moore, begins with the
line at the beginning of this article, in which we learn, for the first time, what the initials A.I. stand
for.
In this accounting, Cartwright was “one of the Neanderthal men (who were the original spele-
os)”. He began his caving career 500 years ago in a large cave in Italy. After staying in this cave
for many years, and “exploring millions of miles of passages”, when he was several thousand
miles from the entrance, he was surprised to see daylight. It turns out he had arrived at the en-
trance to Clover Hollow Cave. Thus, in February 1491, emerging from Clover Hollow, A.l. was the
first to discover America, beating Columbus by a year. But, because he never went back to Eu-
rope and announced his discovery, he never received credit.
In the 14th issue (September 1, 1944), we find a much more credible version by R. C. Cald-
well. At least some parts are best left verbatim:
This mythical character was adopted as an active member into our club almost two years
ago, from a picture showing Bob Hope. Perhaps some of us can still remember this mov-
ie, in which one of the characters “Just wasn't there". Cartwright is often erroneously re-
ferred to as Yehudi's first cousin; to my knowledge he is absolutely no relation to Yehudi
[1].
There were so many happening<sic> that could not be attributed to any of the other
members of the club that it was found necessary to get some one who wasn't to blame
these things on. The loss of food, falling rocks, rain storms, hot-seats – all these and in-
numerably more incidents were accredited to Cartwright's long list of accomplish-
ments. The adoption of this beloved character into the club can be attributed to one
Crouch[2], who has long since departed from our midst. The idea spread rapidly and
Cartwright was readily accepted as a member by everyone. Later he was given the name
Aloysius Ignats by R.N. Southworth, ex-poet laurete of this paper....
As time went on Cartwright became more and more infamous, causing flat tires, light
gremlins, tight squeezes, etc; as new members came into the club, his real identity was
kept a secret. He often signed Pledgee's cards and did other things that flesh-n-blood
members did. He became Chief-Editor-in-Chief of our paper at the first staff meeting and
has retained that position ever since.
The full article is a bit longer, with some mention of his earlier “supposed” feat of discovering
America and other information, but the above is the key part. [Author note: I have searched for
the Bob Hope movie mentioned, but have found nothing. Apparently it was not very memorable,
even by 1944.]
Also in this issue of the Grapevine there is a special announcement that A.1. Cartwright had regis-
tered for a physics class at VPI, and was doing pretty well, but was ultimately dropped from class
because of too many absences. “That's a real cave man for you - when he can't even stay above
ground long enough to attend classes”.
