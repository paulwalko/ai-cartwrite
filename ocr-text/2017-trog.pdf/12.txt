NSS CONVENTION
The NSS Convention was held in Ely, NV. Despite
the monstrously gusty wind, everyone had a great
time at the competitions, exploring the natural
beauty of Nevada, and gawking at Balister in
galaxy leggings. A group of Horizontal Cavers
rigged a traverse line between tents so no rogue
cavers would get blown off-track by the
wind - good thinking, Horz!
