On Discoveries
By Deirdre Conroy
The following describes just one gut-wrenching, sphincter clenching story of old:
Exploration around the mouth of an in-cave 404ft pit. This explorer, who may or may not be a long-
time NSS librarian— on this particular day is alone. He is traversing the lip of this enormous pit— 100'
in diameter— with nothing but a carbide lamp, a sketchbook, and a compass, to map the possible
booty hiding on the other side of the pit's expanse. He is scooting his way along this ledge, that is
about 7 inches across, and positioned immediately beside the lip of this large pit. The entirety of his
feet and his lower legs hang off this ledge, into the black yawning below. The ledge is beginning to
grow thinner— 7 inches squeezes to 6. His back is pressed against the wall behind him. He is not
looking down at this point. He is beginning to notice the octave of the three waterfalls roaring into this
pit. One is 200ft tall, one is 150ft tall, and one is 300ft tall. If you have never heard the sound of not
one but three waterfalls cascading down 150ft+ onto hard rock below, within a confined space, essen-
tially a room, let me tell you, it is not only impossible to hear another human talking when they are
only a couple feet from you, but it is difficult to hear oneself think. The noise is immense. The noise
crawls through your eardrums into your skull where it rattles your brain so much as to muck up your
thinking. Handling the anxiety of poising oneself on 6 inches of muddy, sloping ledge over a drop of
40 stories— so tall that if you fell, you would be able to emit a full scream, take a breath, and then emit
another full scream— amid the intense sound of this place is something beyond the comprehension of
many. To make matters more exciting, this particular human was working his way along a 6 inch wide
ledge when his light gave out. As carbide lamps are rather complex to re-light, and as he was out of
carbide to relight said light with, this particular human was in a bit of a hard spot. One might say he
was even "between a rock and a hard place"— although that 'other' hard place was at the end of a
400ft fall. This particular human pulled out a flint, and struck his carbide lamp, again and again. In the
moments of sparking between strikes, he took advantage of the light, and scooted himself back to
safety, downslope, along this ledge, along this pit edge. It is rumored to have taken 17+ strikes to get
himself back onto the safety of the chock-stone bridge that acts as the 'safe zone' above this particular
pit. Or so, at least the stories say.
My interest in this particular story is the damn courage that this person showed to do this kind of ex-
ploration, alone, along this pit edge, as this pit is really something otherworldly. This past spring break,
I went to TAG. On the Friday of our trip, March 10, myself, Ryan Maurer, Eric Hahn, Emily Dillon,
and David Crawford began our trip into Fern Cave. A special mentor of ours had told us that morning
that it would be a life-changing experience. He was right. Fern was unbelievable. The seemingly-
normal stream passage before the
beginning of the ledge traverse gives
no hints as to the expanse of air that
hides below. When I first clipped in
to that line and peeked over the
edge into Surprise, I felt as if bal-
anced on the thin, decorative upper
ledges of a cathedral, only trafficked
by the crows and window-washers.
Emily and I rappelled down first in-
to the hurricane that existed at the
bottom of the waterfalls, robust with
spring rains. The winds, mist spray,
and deafening sound of that water
made the pit deck feel like an entire-
