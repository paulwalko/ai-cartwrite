Prusik or Helical?
By Andrew Schoenewolf
Ascending on knots has been a rite of passage for many beginner cavers just starting out
their vertical exploits. Climbing knots all allow the user to climb using the same basic
principle: they provide friction when loaded from the bottom and can be advanced up-
wards when not loaded, known as a friction hitch. A system of three such knots is typi-
cally used to ascend in a “frog' style motion, alternating between loading and advancing
the foot loop knots and top knot respectively.
There are several different knots that can be used safely ascend rope, but few are as popu-
lar or widely used and the prusik and the helical. The prusik is one of the earliest known
ascending knots, developed by Karl Prusik, an Austrian mountaineer, in 1931. The helical
is a more modern knot that requires a little more skill to tie. Both knots have their ad-
vantages and disadvantages.
The prusik is perhaps one of the simplest friction hitches to tie. It requires only the use of
any adequate fixed loop knot, such as the bowline, and a few wraps around the climbing
rope. Because of its simplicity, it is often the first knot used to teach beginners to climb
with knots. The prusik requires at least two turns, but can also be used with three for ad-
ditional friction, each turn results in twoʻwraps' or loops around the main line.

The helical knot is considered a slightly more advanced knot and not always rec-
ommended to beginners because of this (Nylon Highway, 22:9). The knot is tied by wrap-
ping cordage around the main line and securing it with a tie-off knot, typically a bowline.
