recovery raid by Steve Hall and Don Davison. Based on Trog articles, it would appear that there
were two likenesses of A.l.; the one made by Bob Simonds for the 1966 Banquet, and the one
made by Robyn Wick for the 1971 Banquet. It is not clear which one was stolen by the
frat. However, this is another good inference that
A.l. and The Troglodyte have become one and the
same.
VIRGINA
This matter is put to rest definitively in the Spring
1973 issue, where Don Davison publishes the lyrics
to a song he wrote, The Troglodyte. Introducing the
lyrics, he writes:
â€œThe inspiration for this song is A.1. Cart-
wright, the V.P.I. Grotto mascot, who appears
on our patch."
A.1. Cartwright came "back to life" with the 25th anni-
versary of the Cave Club, and has become such a
core part of the Club's lore and legends that it is
hard to imagine it was ever not so. As we now ap-
proach the 75th anniversary of the Club, A.I. Cart-
wright has been featured on numerous Troglodyte
covers and artwork, and has become an enduring
symbol of our extended family/organization.
