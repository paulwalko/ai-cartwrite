found our femurs to be a bit too short. Rather than risk it and plummet to the bottom, we
voted to climb down - rather than across - the canyon. This proved to be a most fortuitous
choice. After one particularly grueling high angle shot, we found ourselves in a decorat-
ed, sparkling area with lots of wind and audible water. Objective #2: Locate a water
source -- ACHIEVED! We surveyed to the water, rejoiced, and packed our bags.
Very pleased with our discovery, we retraced our steps to Carlin, Steve, and Michael who
wanted to wrap up the room they were surveying before turning around. In the interest
of avoiding inevitable bottlenecks on the exit, we decided to head out and wait for them
on the surface (where there was hot food and cold beer). Exit fever was running high and
we scrambled through the 800 Foot Crawl in about fifteen minutes and flew down the 50'
rappel - it's so much nicer to rappel than free-climb when you're tired - to the stream. We
opted for the stream exit since it takes less time and it cools you off as you go. It was
about 1am when we left the cave, making it an 11 hour trip. Upon exiting the cave, we
found it was sleeting; good thing we went through the stream on the way out! The lack of
trees in the field made for rather breezy changing, but those dry clothes felt all the warm-
er. Camp stoves were fired up, (very) cold beers were cracked, and we chatted until the
first team exited the cave - about an hour after us - before hitting the hay.
