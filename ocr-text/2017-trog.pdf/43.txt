digging project and chipped at the filled in passage with a hammer. This area could
probably benefit from more advanced digging techniques, but there are plenty of con-
cerns voiced about doing anything too drastic.
At this point, we turned around and started the trek back. Once back at the entrance,
the group was very split up, and with everybody still having plenty of energy, those in
front decided to keep going down the passage in the other direction. This passage
was the same as the rest of the cave, except with more bats. Jason and Jeramie
counted over 100 bats which included big brown, little brown, northern long eared, tri-
colored, and eastern small footed. Unfortunately not all those on the trip understood
that loud noises wake up bats, so there were a few flying around us during our trek.
This section of cave was less decorated with old signatures, and had signs of more
recent cavers. Thankfully there were no major displays of modern graffiti, just old in-
frastructure from the original project. We did come across another entrance, up a 20'
vertical chimney. After some discussion, we determined that we would leave it as a
voice connection to the surface, as nobody was comfortable climbing the probably too
tight shaft. We turned around after about an hour of walking. There is still plenty of
cave to see, but it was apparent that some on the trip had had enough.
Once back at the entrance, we collected as a group and made the climb back out. We
covered the entrance, as to not advertise where it was, and headed back to the cars.
All the while discussing how we have to come back and check out how far into the
cave we could have gone, had it not been for us turning around. There was also dis-
cussion of other local caves in the area that were worth checking out.
Like any good trip, we all went to the local diner to swap stories before everybody
parted their separate ways. Thankfully, we were able to stay at a local caver's apart-
ment for the night, and then bright and early the next day headed back to Blacksburg.
Below is a map of the cave.
