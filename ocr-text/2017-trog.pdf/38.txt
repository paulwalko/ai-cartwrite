So, in the year between A.l. first appearing in the
Anniversary Edition and the Banquet a year later,
Cartwright has become enough of a fixture in Cave
Club lore that the Club's new and most prestigious
award is named after him. However, we still can-
not infer whether or not A.l. has yet become synon-
ymous with The Troglodyte. In fact, there is no de-
finitive statement in the records that the two char-
acters have become one until the Spring 1973
Trog. However it becomes obvious from that entry
that it had been accepted as common knowledge
for some time at that point.

In the meantime, A.I. Cartwright continues to be a
presence in The Troglodyte. In the Fall 1969 issue, —
under the heading “Questions Addressed to Our
Founder”, we have that A.l. has become an advice
Winter 1982
columnist, answering intimate questions specific to cavers. The Fall 1970 issue includes a reprint
of the first A.I. biography (where he discovers America before Columbus).
Then in Winter 1971 we find A.I. Cartwright is the author of the article on Banquet 1971. One of
the awards is a Guano Cluster to “Robyn Wick, for doing a really fine job at constructing a remark-
able likeness of old A.I. himself.” While there is no description of what this likeness looked like, it
is not too big a stretch of the imagination that it is the “hairy ape”, which has become, at this
point, synonymous with A.l. However, while that is the most likely interpretation, it is not solid evi-
dence.
In the Spring 1971 issue, Mailbag reports on some mischief involving A.l.:
“A couple of years ago we got a questionnaire from the local congressman who was up for
re-election. So, several of us got together, pooled our resources, answered questions con-
cerning opinions on the Draft, Vietnam, and political affiliations, made it totally absurd,
signed it A.J. Cartwright and sent it in. Well, a couple of weeks later, we got a response tell-
ing us where A.I. stood in political terms. I think we put extremes on the left and right ends
of his poll.”
In the Fall 1971 issue A.I. is the author of an article titled The Slide, reporting on caver adventures
involving a broken water main at the end of the '71 NSS Convention.
In the Fall 1972 issue he writes a letter
to the editor, urging the club to do more
caving (in addition to parties) because
he was getting lonely in Clover Hollow. It
must have had some success, as he is
also the author of a trip report (with
Grotto members) for New River cave
(the first indication that perhaps he
knows more caves than just Clover Hol-
low). Finally, in this same issue, is a re-
port in the Grapevine column about a
frat having stolen the “life size likeness
of A.1. Cartwright”, and of the successful
