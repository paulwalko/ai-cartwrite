Caving as a Climber
Rowen Berman
Before I joined the Cave Club I climbed for eight years, and also worked at a
climbing gym for two. This meant I was a fairly decent climber and that I had spent
a lot of time with other climbers. Though, I haven't been caving for nearly as long,
there is definitely a few notable differences between the two sports.
First off, the cave club has probably been the most welcoming and disgusting-
ly friendly group of people that I have ever met. You guys are definitely quirky, but
everyone in the VPI cave club has been super nice and always ready to answer a few
questions from a clueless freshman.
Second, there's also not as much an air of competition; everyone can take
their time and do what they're comfortable with, and you can take your time in
learning new techniques. When you're starting to cave you aren't pushed to learn
vertical techniques.
The activity itself is really different. The first time I went into a cave I was
scared shitless even though I can handle heights, and I can handle closed spaces.
However, it is a completely different experience underground, with a dim club-
headlamp and a handful of people I had never met before. I thought that caving
would basically be like underground bouldering, which it is to some extent, but
there is so much more to caving then scrabbling over rocks, to get from point A to
point B. There are formations sprouting out of the ground and bright orange sala-
manders in pools of water. Rock climbing brings you to beautiful and exciting plac-
es, but caves are like a whole other world.
Another difference is the technique and the gear. In climbing you basically
use either brute strength or good footwork to move yourself forward. You have tiny
pointy shoes for finding little crannies in the rock face to stand on. So far in caving,
my technique has been to shuffle and shove my body into positions so that I don't
fall into that really scary dark hole, all the while wearing rain boots from Walmart.
This is not even mentioning canyoning, sliding around in mud, and wading through
streams. Caving also uses a different harness, different knots, and when they say
they're climbing, they're usually climbing rope instead of a rock face. By climbing
rope it also means that they're using ascenders or knots, and not climbing rope like
in high school gym.
Finally, with all differences aside, I love both sports. They're challenging and
push the limits of what you can do, and sometimes what you're willing to do. You
also have to be cautious and have fun.
