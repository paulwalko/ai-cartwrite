50 Candles in the Wind
By: Nick Socky
Preface- Once, a group of cavers ventured into Butler Cave with the intention of rigging a 30 ft rope at
The Good Way and starting the survey connection loop from the Christmas passage, through the Dy-
namite Section and into the Candle Room. Because of the number of people, and the cold, wet condi-
tions experienced from the Pancake Crawl and the Froth and Slosh, the connection into the Candle
room was not made. There have been only a two other trips back to the Candle Room since this No-
vember 2015 trip, with the primary directive of setting and gathering dye-trace traps over the sum-
mer. The following trip report is a report of the follow up survey, and certainly will not be the last.
On November 12th, 2016 the large loop in
Bulter cave connecting Neptune's Drop and
the Good Way was finally completed, by a
team tying into the Candle Room. Kelly
McCarthy, Andrew Lycas, Nick Socky, and
Amy Skowronski entered the cave around 11
A.M. ready for the fun of the pancake crawl
and Froth and Slosh (part of the more
"sporting" commute trip) BUT THESE PAS-
SAGES WERE COMPLETELY DRY! Much differ-
ent than the previous experiences going
through this passage. We were able to survey
from the talus slope and about 75% of the
Candle Room in 23 stations and 500.0 Ft! It
was a very solid 12 hour trip and there is still
a lot to survey in that area as well! And some potentially good bolt climbs! Thank you Mark Hodge and
company for making the Froth and Slosh a little more roomie as well.
On February 18th, 2017. Amy Skowronski, Kelly McCarthy, Jonny Prouty, Nick Socky, and Joe Calderone
returned to the Candle Room to
continue the survey of the area.
Amy, Jonny, and Joe ventured
off into the joint controlled
stream canyon to the North ar-
ea of the Candle Room, while
Nick and Kelly finished off the
main area of the Candle
Room. Between both teams
around 1500' of passage was
surveyed, some of it new! More
bolt climbing needs to be done
in the area because the leads in
the upper canyon look poten-
tially very promising. We will
not know until we climb. It was
a 12.5 hour long trip.
