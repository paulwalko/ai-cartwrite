HALLOWEEN
Another wonderful Halloween transpired
this past October. A fun theme of the
evening was members of our club dressing
up as other members. We had a
tremendous costume contest which was
concluded by a very intoxicated Jesus
(with wine spilled down the front of his
robes) leading the group in a â€œprayer" that
was, in fact, Toto's Africa. A few folks left
the party after that. Happy Halloween!
