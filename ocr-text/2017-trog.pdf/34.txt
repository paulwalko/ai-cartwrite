The Life and Times of A.I. Cartwright
By Richard Cobb - VPL 215
The first known biography of A.I. Cartwright begins “Aloysius Ignatz Cartwright was born at a very
early age.” After that, accounts differ.
The VPI Cave Club Student Grotto of the NSS came into being in January 1943. A year later, in the
first issue of the first newsletter, the Grotto Grapevine (January 21, 1944), we find an A.1. Cart-
wright listed at the top of the list of Staff, with the position of Chief Editor-in-Chief. He was to hold
this position in the newsletter for the next several years. This first issue of “The Last Frontier for
the Pioneer (Published Since 1944)” gave no further clues as to who A.1. Cartwright
was. Presumably he had become well known in the first year of the Grotto in order to have such a
listing of prominence, but that story is lost in the mists of time.
We get our first written clues in the third issue of the Grapevine (February 18, 1944) with a Who
Done It? article, and also a sketch of what A.I. might look like.

Who Done It?
When you're flat upon your back,
Crawling thru some devilish crack,
And your canteen pulls out and jerks,
Who done it?
Every caver knows!
When you're chimneying
<illegible> -knees and elbows-
Going up where - only God knows,
If you slip and fall below,
Just an hundred feet or so,
Who done it?
Every caver knows-
It's Cartwright! A.1.!!

Apparently A.I. is still a bit of a mystery. He takes a darker turn in the fourth issue (March 3,
1944), in a poem titled Caving Saving, by R.N. Southworth. It is a moralistic and cautionary tale of
the caver, “I. Knowhow”, who has a habit of getting ahead of the rest of his group and exploring
leads on his own. Which leads him to an unfortunate end:
Clover Hollow has side passes galore, Some of them with quite a thin floor,
1. Knowhow started to explore. He broke through, now he is no more!
A broken neck was the repartee Cartwright gave to this smarty.
