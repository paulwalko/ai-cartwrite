PICNIC
The fire burned
brightly (MORE
WOOD!), no cars
were hit by golf balls,
and people
actually went caving!
It isn't Picnic if someone's car doesn't get at least
slightly battered, and this year was no different - two
vehicles were down and out for the count and
everyone ended up riding back to the main field in the
back of Wells' pickup.
