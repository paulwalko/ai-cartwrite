The “Speleological Opportunist” Ploy
Perfecting this trick facilitates killing two birds with one rock. Start by inviting the most beautiful
woman in your office on her first cave exploring trip. Experience demonstrates that she will show up
in fishnets, heels, and a leather skirt.
As luck would have it, a short distance underground this costume proves inappropriate for tough cav-
ing. Befuddled, the lass anxiously asks to return to the sunshine outdoors. At this juncture, simply
jump to the breech with a well-rehearsed one-liner. Something like, “You know baby, there is a way
out of here.”
The “Rescue Squad” Ploy
The technique of being appended to the local cave rescue team opens up a wealth of scenarios. Clear-
ly, for one who is perpetually “on call” it would be the height of irresponsibility to risk going under-
ground at any time. Doing so might distance you from the telephone and, hence, confound a time-
sensitive rescue call out.
What if a rescue was officially initiated? Who can attend a cave rescue wearing dirty or worn out spe-
leo garb?
Best to stay home, stay safe, and wait for the emergency alert. If worse comes to worst, you can al-
ways volunteer in the First Aid tent.
Besides, whenever a real disaster actually happens, rescue groupies generally come out of the wood-
work and serve up some pretty good sandwiches.
The “Entrance Photographer” Ploy
A prerequisite for the application of this ploy is a good collection of entrance shots. Such a portfolio
may then be used during an endless series of grotto presentations where everyone will assume that you
actually “bottomed” the cave pictured.
“This, folks, shows the main entrance to Fern,” one explains. “Such tranquil surroundings barely hint
at the terrors which lie within.”
Then, advancing to the next image: “Now, we peruse the top of Cemetery Pit, which is clearly very
different from Golondrinas, as seen on the following slide.”
And, upon showing the New Entrance to Ellison's: “Behind this unassuming crack lies the deepest
freefall pit in the United States. We found a descent of the shaft to be a bit tricky and it is likely that a
rope would have been useful.”

Many variations of the above ploys are possible. Indeed, it is sometimes necessary to synthesize addi-
tional gambits for particularly dicey situations. Perhaps, the “Support Team” ploy or the “Solo Man”
ploy will eventually find their
way into our repertoire. It is
hoped, however, that the above
list summarizes an adequately
comprehensive series of tricks
to maintain an elevated ego for
even the most ardent loafer. If
not, perhaps it would be easier
to simply go caving.
