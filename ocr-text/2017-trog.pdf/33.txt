AND NOWA POEM!
Arise to the blinding light of day. The darkness calling already for much too long, for a late start has
happened. The explorers scramble to evade the burning fire. Enter, they do around high noon.
A crowd it is at first, slowly thinned by the various needs of the cave. Some travel here. Others travel
there. A small cluster of cavers already lurks in the depths. Four swiftly fly through the trunk. Deeper
and deeper they go.
Hiking, wading, climbing, crawling, twisting, turning, frothing, sloshing.... But wait. Old man winter has
yet to weep, the plumbing of the earth drier than normal. No longer cold being the foe, friction be-
comes the main antagonist.
Grunting, your pack moves a few inches forward. Cursing, you move a few inches forward, Oh blast
this wretched hole. Curious, it is, the lack of wet and cold causes such a hindrance on ones movement.
The compromise, though, is later appreciated.
Like a prairie dog, one by one, the four emerge from their little tunnel passage to the larger world be-
yond. The walls tower up into a large arching ceiling, guiding the eyes up and then forward into the
newly appreciated comfort of space.
Refueling in a room, be it calories, caffeine, or both. Savage the cavers are, as they tear apart the MIO
soaked beef-jerky. A dessert of cheese and chocolate to celebrate the journey thus far is also con-
sumed. The harnesses must now be loosened to fit, for comfort in abseiling is of great desire.
Crystalline distractions. Fractured Walls. Mud. The cavers clamber atop a spine of flowstone, where a
mud snake waits patiently for its next passenger. Slithering into the darkness below, shouts are made
as they disappear into an hourglass of stone.
The flick of a pencil moving rapidly on the book. A
laser pointing to a new destination. Flagging tape
ripples slightly in the air guiding the cavers on-
ward. Intricately transposing the tales of the cave
between dimensions slows time to a crawl.
Misting droplets of condescended vapor swirl up-
ward in four singular beams of light. A chill runs
through the bevy as the sinister foe of hypo lurks
in its fortitude of darkness and time. Layers of pro-
tective propylenic-mail are the only defense.
Far off, a particle of light is born. Then another,
then another. A soft glow begins to fill the abyss,
from muddy floor to dendritic debris covered ceil-
ing. 50 Candles in the wind are lite. Warmth and
light brings a balance to the darkness. The Candle
Room is born.
