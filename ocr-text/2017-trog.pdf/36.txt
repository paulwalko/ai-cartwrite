A.I. remains the Chief-Editor-in-Chief of the Grapevine through the Spring 1947 issues. There is
no record of any Grapevines being published again until 1951, by which time it had become a
slightly more serious publication, focused more on new exploration, techniques, speleology and
cave biology. A.l. fades into history, at least in the written record. In fact, there is over a 20 year
span when A.I. Cartwright seems to have completely vanished from the written record. For many
of those years records are sparse, with no newsletters or other publications, so it is possible he
was not completely forgotten. But I have not been able to find a single mention of him in the sur-
viving records.
The Tech Troglodyte
Today everyone knows the Chairy ape' on the cover of most Tech Troglodytes is A.I. Cartwright. That
has not always been so. After carefully reviewing the records, I am convinced that there is a mini-
mum 6 year period where the club mascot was simply known as The
Troglodyte, or 'hairy ape'.
The mascot first appeared on the cover of the first issue of The Trog-
lodyte, published in February 1962. It is a familiar image that has
appeared on, or in, nearly every issue since. Other than appearing
on the masthead next to the title The Tech Troglodyte, there is no
mention of who or what the mascot is. In the second issue (April
1962) a credit is given to John Danner for being the creator of “the
troglodyte” image.
That the mascot is not yet known as A.I. Cartwright is reinforced by a
couple of Letters to the Editor. In the Fall 1963 issue, past Grotto
president Jim Quinlan writes:

“I like most of the content of the Tech Troglodyte, but I de-
plore the use of the hairy ape as an emblem or mast-
head. Am I alone in my adverse criticism of the beast?”
In the next issue (Fall 1964) Herb Klein (Class of '59 and former
Cave Club member) writes that
“I disagree with Jim Quinlan's objection to cover. Most of us looked like that after a long
caving trip in those days.
In the meeting minutes for October 30, 1964 a report from the Patch Committee included passing
around a sketch of a proposed design, which is described in the minutes: “It consisted mainly of
The Troglodyte or “Hairy Ape” superimposed on a carabiner.” And in a report from the Member-
ship Committee the previous week regarding membership cards, a motion was made to “have an
imprint of the Troglodyte, the 'Hairy Ape'".
The Spring 1965 issue of the Troglodyte announces that VPI “finally has a patch”.
“The design is a full-length likeness of John Veitch inside a carabiner. John is wearing a
hard hat and light, has a rope over his shoulder, a canteen at his side, and his hands drag-
ging the ground. His looks are Oriental, but this is understandable, since the patches were
ordered from Japan. With six different colors, VPI can truthfully boast a 'colorful' patch."
