Re-Survey: A Celebration of Inadequacy
By Jonathan Roberts
Many hobbies are glamorous. Rock
climbers have the promise of beautiful
views after a day of hard-fought pitch-
es. Sky divers are guaranteed those few
minutes of adrenaline-fueled bliss each
and every time. Fishermen will, with
enough patience, hook that elusive
trout high up on a mountain stream.
Cavers, of course, have the dream of
virgin passage full of rare decorations
and continued promise. These special
moments may be marred by hours of
grueling work to get to them but they
are out there, the caver keeps telling
him or herself.
Much of what was easily won by cavers has been mapped. The old salts will tell
you just how plentiful the passage was, hearing names like Friars Hole or Windy
Mouth in West Virginia and Peery Saltpeter or Perkins in Virginia. The names go
on: Perkins. Slusser's Chapel. Maxwelton. Dry Cave.
Sprawling, easily found exploration is only half the story, though. This new gener-
ation has a grand beast to conquer never dreamed about in the days of hemp
rope: the re-survey. This magical gem, born from the
inadequacy of previous generations gives hope to
cavers not sure why we are still sleeping in awful cab-
ins and drinking Ol' Mil. The good fight is upon us.
Our Great War has just begun.
Next time you
leave out from a
field station in the
early morning,
bleary-eyed and
feeling the effects
of adjunct lager
from the night
before, mention in
passing to the grey
haired folks milling
about just which
cave it is you're
going to.
