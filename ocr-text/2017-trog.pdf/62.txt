L- Survey Bolt Climbing: Windy Mouth Gets Real
By: Nick Socky
On March 11th, 2017 Kelly McCarthy, Joe Calderon and myself (Nick Socky), started the 2nd phase of
bolt climbing in Windy Mouth. As some folks, might know, Tommy Polson and Jon Lillstolen have
been working on the E survey bolt climb which has resulted in roughly a 1000 ft. of passage that is
still going! Well, there are also two more know domes in the cave. Off the main survey, going to the
waterfall room, is a left-hand turn (right at BD-21) which takes you to a not so pleasant looking can-
yon, with water in it. Well as you can guess, this lead is the next two dome bolt climbs are.
Kelly, Joe, and I got up a little earlier than
usual to some blistering cold temperatures
of 15 degrees outside. We wanted to get a
head start on the day because we were
hauling a lot of a gear fairly deep into the
cave. We got to the parking area, and had
a crisp jaunt up down the river and up onto
the cliff side- it was so cold out, that we
didn't have any fear of having the high
route give out on us, and send us to our
doom in the cold Greenbrier, and we got
to the cave entrance right around 9:20 A.M.
-this might be the earliest arrival time? Not
sure what time Tommy has gotten to the cave before.
Anyways, we began our trek into the cave.
Because of all the rope, vertical gear, bolt-
ing gear, and personal gear, and lack of a
4th person (Sherpa) we lugged a 4th pack
between the three of us. it wasn't too bad
going in the main passage, but we were
certainly moving a bit slower than usual.
Typically, a strong group of surveyors can
get to the waterfall room in roughly an
hour, it took us about 1.5 hours to get to
our turn off- which is about 7 min away
from the waterfall room.
And then the fun began... the only beta I had of this passage was from
looking at the old data LRUDs at each station and from those numbers it.
didn't look that bad. For the most part, the passage was an average of 2
feet across and 10 ft. tall; classic stream canyon passage. It would have
been nice to see the cross sections... Of that 2 ft., tall L/R, you could for
the most part only fit in about 1 to 2 ft. of the 10 ft. up down, and to
make it even more fun, the largest section was typically about 3 to 5 feet
above the water, so you didn't have to worry about getting wet except
for a few times, but if you dropped your pack, good luck getting to it!
So, it was a tight contortion belly crawl where you have to hold your
pack up in front of you or prop it up/wedge it, so you can move for-
ward. This would be fine if it were just a survey trip with a small pack,
but we were hauling bolting gear. Lastly, to add to the fun, we had to
route find our way vertically through the canyon. Sometimes, it got too
tight down low and we had to find a way to climb up higher to get
around the pinch and then it forced us back down (got to tight up high)
straight into pools of water, sometimes kneed deep. I know I am really
selling this!!
