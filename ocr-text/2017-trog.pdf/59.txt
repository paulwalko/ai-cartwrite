Or stuck till sunrise.
La Routa 85 (Hotel California – Eagles)
On a bright mountain highway,
Cool wind in my hair.
Warm smells of exhaust and banos,
Rising up through the air.
Up ahead round the corner,
I saw breaking lights.
My head grew hot and our engine dead,
I saw no accident.
Driving into the city,
Every exit is blocked.
We go to follow the locals around,
But every failure's a shock.
Stuck back on a side road,
Post-apocalyptic vibes.
Mango teams up with Deighan now,
To get the hell out of dodge.
Semis blocking the roadway,
I heard people exclaim.
Zimapan was done with gas gouging,
Or plans for the day were a mess.
Rested at the restaurant,
With some great bistec.
Waiting to go to Tulantongo,
Our Idaho friend did say:
Last road though the backway, we were
Making a break for 30.
Driving through Grand Canyon parks,
And topes of triple three.
Driving fast for the toll roads,
So close we can see.
But the trucks are there waiting for us,
So we can never leave.
Welcome to la routa 85,
Such a lovely place,
Such a deserted waste.
The road is closed on la routa 85,
We are stuck here,
So grab a cold beer.
We Didn't Drink the Water (We Didn't Start the
Fire – Billy Joel)
We didn't drink the water!
We still got the shits,
But we didn't drink the water!
Hiking up in the hillside,
Thorny bushes of pain.
Beautiful sunsets up on top,
But we're in the moving lane.
Sad decisions to skip the
Hot spring plan.
Pachuca is our destination,
Until we're stopped again.
Tommy & Sope (Folsom Prison Blues – Johnny
Cash)
Tommy and Sope,
Walking down the street,
It's best not to cross them,
Or they'll break you at your knee.
He's alpha horse primero- president guy.
He's gotta be the greatest, or he'll make sure you
die.
So I called up the Jefe,
Deighan looked so sublime.
He said, “We can only go forward from here now
And we'll have to spend the night”.
At 2am we drove south and away,
Optimism reigns for a couple miles,
Till Ixmilquipan.
He's making his own path,
Or he'll knock you off yours,
Skin you off on walls,
A sadist to the core.
He's alpha horse primero-president guy.
He's gotta be the greatest, or he'll make sure you
die.
Welcome to la routa 85,
Such a fed-up place,
Such a solemn pace.
They closing all roads out on routa 85,
Get out alive,
[*Sope was a horse Tommy rode, who aggressively needed
to be first, and had no qualms about using whatever he
needed to get there. So... basically Tommy in horse form.]
