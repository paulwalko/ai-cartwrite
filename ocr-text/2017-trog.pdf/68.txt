“Don't seem to get underground much nowadays,” they mutter despondently. “Can't take the same
risks anymore; unfair on the kids.”
So saying, they leap into their hemi-powered SUVs and become urban charioteers, mowing down
crash barriers and terrorizing the walking populace.
“Sorry you had to wait up for me, dear,” they apologize after shrieking home in a cloud of dust. “Just
stopped in for a quick one with the boys and got a bit carried away.”
Some aging cavers, no longer able to cut the mustard in the netherworld, have been known to contem-
plate matrimony as the only honorable way out.
The “Speleo-Politician” Ploy
This technique relies on the premise that the character in question is, in fact, too busy determining the

the easier days of Sump II in Gouffre Berger. But, some of us seasoned veterans have to make the sac-
rifice and I am only too glad to do it. You wetsuited youngsters continue your playful ways and I'll see
to it that the caverns remain open for all of us.'
The “Quasi-Veteran” Ploy
Historians have recorded that Bill Torode only begins to function properly when he is hundreds of feet
below the surface of the Earth in a jagged crawlway. This adds up to a pretty considerable handicap
when you consider how much of his life must be spent topside. It is all part of the mystique which sur-
rounds The Men who are expected to Go Deep.
To utilize this ploy to its fullest, it is advantageous, but not strictly necessary, to have an NSS number
below 7500. Nevertheless, a certain vocabulary of “buzz words” needs to be cultivated. For example:
Swildon's VI
Gouffre Berger
the rappel spool
Lew Bicking and I
the PSM
that crazy Mike Boon
Proventina
Vertical Bill
minus 2000 meters
freefall
totally unjustifiable rigging

quite deep

The “Landowner Relations” Ploy
Axiomatic to this ploy is that no landowner, regardless of outward friendliness, really wants anyone
fooling around under his property. If everyone remembered this simple fact, we would all be spared a
lot of needless caving. Acting like a rich city slicker, four-wheeling around on his front porch, or
shooting a couple of cows usually does the trick.
At the next grotto meeting it is all very easy to explain. “We arrived in good shape and intent on div-
ing the final sump. However, the red-necked hick that owns the place was in a crummy mood, so we
visited with him only briefly and then left to maintain good landowner relations.”
