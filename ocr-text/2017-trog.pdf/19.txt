GROTTO GRAPEVINE
Earlier this year, a trainee was involved in a woeful mishap involving walloping Indiana
Grays off of cave ceilings with baseball bats. This transpired due to a failed attempt at
being in too many conversations at once and hearing the tail ends of two different topics.
Our sources tell us that one conversation was about someone's grandson learning to play
baseball while the other discussion was centered around how well bats fly. This led to the
aforementioned trainee creating a sport they dubbed Inverted Tee Ball. When we
received the invitation for a game, we didn't understand the concept or understand the
"BYOB‚Äù that was included at the end of the invite. On the bright side, we had plenty of
empties to throw at the trainee when he gave us the run-down of the rules.
At Old Timers Reunion, Chris Garguilo was found
near the bonfire wearing a blue sequined dress
proclaiming that dancing with rules was for squares
while he did the Macarena backwards.
Feeling frustrated after his attempts to contact a
CHUD (Cute, Hunky, Unforgettable Date) were
unsuccessful due to lack of cell service underground,
Jason Sargent invented the Bat Cave Connection
hotline. You know, for when wireless phones fail but
you still need to get in touch with that weird, pasty,
semi-human creature you ate helmet pizza and a
dead trainee with on a candlelit rock while wrapped in
a trash bag. It's all about keeping the romance alive,
ladies and gents.

For Spring Break, a handful of cavers went
to TAG, where they were forced to rig
numerous vertical traverses to get to the
crawls they were planning on
photographing. They spent each day
hauling coils of ropes up and down
mountains to get that perfect shot of
someone crammed in a 1x2 crawlspace.
While at Stephen's Gap, the next group
arrived early - it was a bunch of Patagucci/
Fratagonia backpackers toting brand new
helmets. When the cavers complimented
their clean helmets, the hiking bros told
them that they had purchased the helmets
purely because the permit said helmets
were required. The jabronies dumped their
packs and helmets under a tree and
wandered into the lower entrance of the
cave because when it comes to helmets,
it's the thought that counts.
