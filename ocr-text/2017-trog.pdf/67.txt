Or, for an afternoon's tour of Hooper's Well he will unveil a 9-bar Super Rack. “Not much good for
these rabbit holes, I guess, but it sure was mighty handy at ‘drinas.”
Any off-the-cuff comment of this nature generally goes over very well with the hordes of novices pre-
sent. You'll be so mobbed signing autographs and recommending carabiners it'll be abundantly clear
that you are far too important to waste the day underground.
The “Phony Cavern” Ploy
The cornerstone of this gambit has been laid by the uprising of the militant netherworld conservation-
ists. Their official policy advocates being purposely vague regarding the whereabouts of caves. Indeed,
major publications frequently locate caverns only to the nearest county.
With such parameters firmly in mind, merely select a county, pick a Regional Correspondent, and
away you go.
For Immediate Release.
Bulletin!
A major new system has been unearthed in Jackson County, Alabama by none other
than the Colossal Speleo Mega-Man.
“Exploring for days in the labyrinth of passageways, we were finally stopped by a
seemingly bottomless abyss. The 800-foot rope that we always carry “just in case'
proved inadequate for the task and we eventually exited the cavern without incident,”
reported one member of the team.
Dauntless, the Mega-Man returned the following weekend to solo the drop (later esti-
mated at 1095 feet) and, upon returning topside, permanently sealed the entrance with
some well-placed Tovex.
“This is no place for the novice,” he explained while coiling the longest section of PMI
that this reporter has ever seen.
We can only hope that further information will be forthcoming in the months ahead.
Such information is, in fact, never “forthcoming”, but is easily explained away by invoking the ubiqui-
tous “Anti-Publication” ploy.
The “Pseudo-Scientist” Ploy
The essence of this ploy is to cultivate an aura of intellectual respectability. Once the mystique is
formed it is hard to go wrong. Encumbered with a myriad of collection bottles and verbose nomencla-
ture, such a genius is hardly an appropriate companion for a sporting trip to the dreaded netherworld.
I once accompanied such a lad on a supposed “push trip” to the New Section of a well-known cave.
While I refettled a temperamental headlamp before venturing underground, my companion sulked just
inside the drip-line minutely examining the underside of an insect with his reading glass.
“Bugs are my business,” he finally admitted after much probing. “And, everyone knows that such mul-
tilingual, polygamous, isolated tripods are never found beyond the entrance region. You guys go ahead
and push on downstream. I'll linger here a few hours longer and, perhaps, join you on the way out.”
The “Responsible Family Man” Ploy
This gambit is nearly infallible because it exploits the very foundations of our existence.
