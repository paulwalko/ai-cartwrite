Spiderman-esque skills, which no one on the team
had. The smallest person (myself) was lowered via
webbing to the bottom where I found that alt-
hough I couldn't get down without assistance, I
was able to climb out in one particular spot using
a Didn't Feel Sketchy But Looked Haphazard To
Everyone Else On The Team dynamic move. Since
the passage died and the other folks on the team
weren't too keen (for good reason), I was passed
the instruments and solo-surveyed the last part of
the passage: a gloppy, watery crawlway. It was
fairly bleak. On the bright side, Bill and Eric were
still vaguely audible and could be heard laughing.

As 11pm rolled around, we started making our way back. Jason met us at the junction we
surveyed and went down the left-hand lead that we had determined to be unclimbable
where, as is standard, he climbed to the bottom and had no difficulty getting back out. Af-
ter reconvening at DOM 7, the teams changed a bit because I wanted to give the Tight
Place a try but we didn't want to send Eric and Bill out with just two people. Zach, Caleb,
Jason, and myself exited the cave about 30 minutes before Eric, Bill, and Janet. The trip
was ~7 hours.
There was a slight drizzle outside which made for very peaceful sleeping.
The annual Appalachian Cave Conservancy meeting took place the following day
(Saturday, for those of you following along at home) in the field station near Perkins Cave
- as is caver tradition, the meeting started a little late but there was good food and hot cof-
fee! The first team (consisting of Steve Ahn, Michael Johnson, and Carlin Kartchner) en-
tered the cave about halfway through the meeting. After the meeting, the second team
(comprised of Jason Lachniet, Janet Manning, and Amy Skowronski) made their way into
the cave. The commute to our survey was fun and interesting; we moved at a reasonable
pace since I was trying to learn the route and Jason pointed out recognizable features and
leads as we went.

We caught up with the first
team after the 800 Foot
Crawl - at first I thought
the name must be an exag-
geration but as Jason said,
"Well, 'four hundred foot
crawl, twenty foot walk,
three hundred and eighty
foot crawl' just doesn't
have the same ring to it."
We found Carlin sketching
