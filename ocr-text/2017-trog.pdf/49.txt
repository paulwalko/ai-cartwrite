ly different world from the quiet (only relatively) of the bridge from which we rigged. We were
soaked within minutes, but too amazed to care. We quickly tandem ascended to rave about the pit to
the rest of our team waiting above, and to stress that it may not be wise to wait down there in the wa-
ter and the winds. On the ascent, the waterfall on the far side of the room was much easier to get a
view of. It has been measured at ~400ft tall, stretching from a silvery cord at the top to a wavering
wall of whitewater in the 100ft before it slams onto the pit floor below. As for the pit itself— I had
never been within something that enormous before— pitch in all directions, rope reaching into black
above me. For those nebulous middle 200ft where both the enormous breakdown pile and the rig-
ging ledge are both out of sight, only Emily's headlamp, maybe 40ft below me, was my connection to
tangibility. I shouted down to Emily when we got to the pigtail— the marker that we were only 150ft
from the top— only to realize that the words were swallowed by the incredible sound. I know I
walked away from that trip feeling pretty exuberant, with my understanding of speleology and the
potential of cave exploration forever changed. We left feeling— like the giants before us— pretty
‘fired up'.
You may now be wondering why the hell you should care about TAG, or about this cave, or about
this crazy Deirdre girl at all. I'm not the point. This cave, in this particular part of the world, is the
place where many SRT techniques really got their first push into being. It is near this cave that the
now deepest pits in the country were discovered, where incredible formations were found, and where
many historical moments of American caving occurred. Another interesting tidbit about this cave was
that at the time of Surprise's discovery, it was the deepest pit in America, 437' deep at the older rig-
point. Here's another thing— it was found by Bill Torode, who was 17 years old when he first stum-
bled upon it. Granted, he did not stumble, because the roar of the waterfalls flowing into that thing
roar from 100' upstream. But his discovery was an accident. He was eating his sandwich at the cave
entrance- a waterfall with two holes leading into black beneath it, when he felt he should catch up
with his trip, and ran into the entrance closest to him. He did not see their lights, so he hurried on-
ward, worried he was really far behind. Continues, continues, until a yawning black opens up in front
of him. He throws one rock, doesn't hear a thing. He throws another rock, gives up on hearing it
land, and finally hears it smash the deck of the pit six seconds later, when he had already committed
to leaving the cave. What commenced after that was
disbelief, and a number of weeks of exploration and Under A Rock - 2017
contemplation over how to reach the bottom, until
finally, Bill Cuddington made the first descent of
the thing. If you still think, “what's the point of this
story?” remind yourself that this was a seventeen
year old who found the then-deepest pit in the
country. It goes to show how little we know about
speleology, how much more there is to discover,
and how anyone can become the next Big Explor-
er— you don't have to be some hot shot. If that
isn't reason enough to get your wellies and your hel-
met and head underground, I don't know what is.
I also want to note that I collected these stories ei-
ther from the mouth of Dave Hughes himself, or
from his book, Vertical Bill, which contains many
great stories about Virginia, as well as TAG, caves,
If you have not met him, heard of him, or read his
stuff as of yet, I highly recommend it. He's been
quite a mentor to me so far in the time that I've
known him.
