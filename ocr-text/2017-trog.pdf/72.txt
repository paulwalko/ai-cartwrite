and Michael wedged themselves in a very small
space that could be considered a crawl but I would
describe as "abysmal." We wished them good luck,
traveled to a walking canyon passage where we ate
food, and dove back into the crawl to survey. We
continued the EFC (Eight-hundred Foot Crawl) sur-
vey, used the same designation, and had some fun
suggesting alternate names - for example, Easy Fun
Cave (and others including some choice language
that you, dear reader, can imagine yourself).
Almost immediately, we ran into some trouble. I
know my StenLight has a magnetic switch, but had
no idea the auxiliary light I was using also had
magnetic components (whoops), so we had some
difficulty getting accurate readings for a couple
shots until we determined that I'm a dingleberry.
Luckily, Janet is a razor-sharp instrument reader so

we were quick to figure out the issue. We encoun-
tered another issue later in the day, when I decided
that I wanted to see some formations with proper clarity and just deal with the hassle of
reading instruments with glasses. After a couple shots we realized that my frames are, in
fact, magnetic. Alas, they were returned to the Pelican Case.
We closed a loop and met back up with the first team (who had surveyed the walking can-
yons where we'd had lunch) in a room with some great fossils in the ceiling. Objective #1:
Close That Loop -- ACHIEVED! Janet took some pictures of the shells and crinoids before
we headed down a promising lead. The passage started

as a stoop-walk but it opened up the further we went
and soon we were standing on a large rock wedged stur-
dily in the middle of a 30-35' tall canyon. The walls were
littered with helictites, making travel (and survey) a very
delicate, careful process. We had some difficulty on one
particular shot and were getting readings that were con-
sistently four to five degrees off from one another, even
after we tried switching places and switching instru-
ments. Very weird. After extensive deliberation, we de-
cided that the cave had a black hole in it and the magnet-
ic field surrounding it was definitely the cause of our in-
strument issues. But in all seriousness, it was really bi-
zarre.
We got to a part of the canyon that Janet and I were un-
comfortable with since neither of us had the required leg
length for the move needed to pass around a rock. Jason
made it look easy but when it was our turn to go, we
