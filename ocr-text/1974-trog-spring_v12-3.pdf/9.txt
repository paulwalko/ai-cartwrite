SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
974
Sunday morning the rain continued and so did the drinking.
The storm grew worse. Everyone began to congregate under the two
tarps to drink and stay dry. The wind began to pick up and soon
it looked like a scene from Moby Dick. The wind lashed and tore
at the canvas tarpi the guy lines where straining and slowly
the tent pegs began to pull out. People began to grab at tent
poles and canvas to prevent their shelter from being blown away.
Mark Slusarski acting as a human tentpole, ( the preceding pun was
fully intentional), helped in saving the shelter. Just as every-
body's spirits were at the lowest, Doug Perking led us out of
the valley of the shadow of death with a rousing chorus of
Amazing Grace.
Around noon the weather began to improve and the 5th keg
was going fast. The Trout Creek Shelter roof was soon replaced
by the porch roof on the house as one by one, naked bodies began
to crawl up there to enjoy the slowly emerging sun and warm
shingles. As everyone knows, after a rain storm there are many
worms slithering about. It seems that one of these creatures
found its way into the possession of Gill Ediger, then to cries
of "How Gross!" and "do it, do it!", Gill threatened to eat
it. This resulted in Franny Gryl and Debbie Marshall crawling
into the kitchen looking kind of green. However Ediger kept on
playing with the worm. Bill Douty finally grabbed it out of
Ediger's hand in disgust and started to eat it himself. Ediger
grabbed it back and continued to suck it in and out of his mouth,
where upon Robyn Loud got ahold of the abused worm, tore it in
half and giving one half to Liz Morgan they both swallowed what
was left of it, (it's nice to see old roomies share and share
alike). Out in the field, Ed Loud, Bob Page, Doug Perking and
Jim Denton took to their respective vehicles and started to tear
around the field performing intricate maneuvers, surpassed only
by the Air Force Blue Angels. A 6th keg was now in the process
of being drunk. Along about evening Jim Denton of the Imperial
Toyota Land Cruiser Fleet made a tactical error and attempted
to push Willy where Willy wouldn't go. The TLC ended up bumper
deep in mud at the bottom of the ravine. In a vain attempt, he
tried to get it out himself, but was forced to seek aid from an
American 4x4 Jeep, Big Blue, commanded by Don Anderson. However
that didn't work either, and at the time of this writing Jim is
considering calling in Jim Hixson to come to his aid with Henry
and is seriously contemplating hari-kari in order to save face,
being confronted with this defeat.
And so that was Spring Picnic 1974, 6 kegs and several cases
of beer had been killed, a TLC was slowly being fossilized,
dozens of cavers were dead drunk and the sun was setting on
Deerwood Farm.
