THE TECH TROGLODYTE__

How does Hadenoecus know when it is the right time and right
atmospheric conditions to venture outside after twilight and look
for food? All cave crickets are very sensitive to changes in
moisture, so they can probably sense the changes in the weather
conditions outside by the rate at which water evaporates in the
cave. Ceuthophilus, living much nearer to the entrance than
Hadenoecus, does not have migratory food habits.
Cave cricket droppings which stick to the walls and floor of
the cave are a source of food for beetles, flies, and larvae.
Predators of the crickets are large cave spiders, Salamanders,
and frogs occasionally found near the cave entrance. The cave
crickets, therefore, are at the base of the food pyramid in a
cave. Without them, many of the other cave fauna would starve.
Hadenoecus and Ceuthophilus play a very important role in
keeping caves in an ecological balance. All speleologists and
sport cavers should work together to conserve these fascinating
insects. Their presence in the cave has a great effect on all
cave life.
