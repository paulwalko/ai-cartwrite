SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1974
And a team has the problem of transporting equipment, too,
unless the region wants to spend an awful lot of money to put a
cache in every county containing caves in Virginia and West
Virginia; otherwise equipment is too far away from the scene of the
accident to do you a whole lot of good. This is the alternitive,
Now I will admit that a well organized, trained, efficient
rescue team would be the ideal situation; or at least better than
what we have now. But I don't think the number of calls we get
warrants the expense and time of setting up such a team. I think
the CRCN is well off as it is now.
There are people who would not agree with this at all. I'm
thinking specifically of the people who are organizing the Blue
Ridge Rescue Group....Plans are for the group to get into cave
rescue; I know they're holding a cave rescue practice next month,
This is fine, but I wonder if this will obviate CRCN, if we'll .
still be needed. I think for the moment, at least, we are. We
can cover a much larger part of the region.... My own sympathies
lie more with the CRCN as it is set up now, I think it is impor-
tant that cave rescues be as local a thing as possible, and I
don't think you should have to get people from extremely far away.
....For one thing, this makes it hard to avoid publicity. From
the point of land owner relationships, this is something we really
don't need.
... I think what's necessary first, (before a nation-wide
communications network) is for each region to have their own, which
is not the present situation, I understand.... I wonder if it's
going to be worth the trouble (to organize nation-wide). There are
very few prople who cave so much in such a diffuse manner that they
cover the entire country and very rarely go to the same place twice,
so that they couldn't find out what the rescue number is for a
given area.
.... I think this (nation-wide network) would run into a fair
amount of expense, and a fair amount of liability for the central
people, depending on how it's run, I. assume you'd want to set up a
toll free number. Otherwise, if someone gets hurt up here in Breath-
ing Cave in Bath County, is he going to call Texas, or is he just
going to call the local police? It's going to be much more diffi-
cult for him to call Texas from a local resident's telephone,
Right now, I think it should be kept on a regional basis,
because I can foresee a lot of problems. Who is the dispatcher
going to be for this number? What kind of number are you going
to set up?...Someone is going to have to be there 24 hours a day.
Are you going to pick up a police department there similar to the
set up we have here?
....Also, the number must be a permanent one. You can't
change it every six months.
I think a better set up would be for each region to have a
rescue network....The volume of calls on a regional level will
be fairly low and it'll be easy to get people like the University
Police here to cooperate."
