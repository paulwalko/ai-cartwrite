SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE

and is mainly a canyon type of passage. Its location way out in
the meander suggests that it was not formed by ground water in the
usual sense, but probably was formed as the creek took a short cut
underground through the bend. Another cave at the neck of the same
bend is just above creek level and goes as a crawlway for eighty-
six feet before becoming too narrow. It too follows the strike and
probably was a cutoff through the meander. A small spring on the
other side of the meander may be the downstream end of a presently
active cutoff. Using a very sensitive thermometer, the temperature
of the water from this spring was found to be intermediate between
the temperature of water from three nearby springs and that of
water from Sinking Creek at locations both upstream and down from
the possible cutoff spring. This temperature difference could be
explained if stream water from the creek changed as it passed through
the cutoff. Flow through the meander may be slow; no obvious intake
point can be seen. I plan to run dye through the bend in the future
to confirm the cutoff.
III. UNDERGROUND DRAINAGE FROM CLOVER HOLLOW:
Just where the streams in Clover Hollow Cave resurge has
puzzled cavers for over twenty-five years. Apparently Earl Thierry
dropped half a pound of fluorescein in a stream in the cave and
didn't see it come out four miles to the southwest at Smoke Hole
Spring. If he just looked for green water to appear at the spring,
that little dye over a four mile distance probably wouldn't have
been visable. Smoke Hole is the most likely place for the cave
water to resurge. It lies downstrike from the cave, is the largest
spring known in the area (ca. one cubic foot per second in low
water), and lies at a low enough elevation (1,820 feet) to drain
the cave, which, to my present knowledge, bottoms out at about
2,000 feet elevation. A spring in Happy Hollow, four miles to the
east of the cave, may be large enough to account for the volume of
the cave streams, but lies at elevation 2,200. A search for large
springs is needed two to three miles to the south on Sinking Creek
(elevation 2,000!), and on John's Creek four to five miles to the
northeast. A resurgence on John's Creek is considered unlikely,
as the rocks there are of Silurian and Devonian age. A profile of
Clover Hollow Cave, however, shows a gentle slope to the northeast,
and the active streams in the cave flow in that same direction.
This puzzling problem should be solved in the future after a spring
inventory and dye tracing are completed.
The relationship of Smoke Hole Spring and the major cave behind
it, to Tawney's Cave and the spring which it feeds, is another
puzzle. Tawney's spring has about one fifth the discharge of Smoke
Hole and lies 1,500 feet downstream from it, on the same side of
the Sinking Creek. Tawney's Cave's stream can be followed about
850 feet up the strike to the northeast before it disappears into
breakdown. At this point it is about 600 feet due south of a large
passage in Smoke Hole. This large passage is the westernmost passage
in Smoke Hole and appears to be an abandoned strike-oriented route
