A WEEKEND 10 REMEMBER, or THE SINKING OF SPRING PICNIC.
There was only the slightest hint of rain on the morning of
May 11. The event, Spring Picnic 1974..... the place, Deerwood
Farm..... the participantsThe V.P.I. Grotto of the N.S.s, and
friends. Cavers flocked to the site, they all remembered it as
the soone of the pagan orgy of the past Halloweon. They were
about to not only equal the Halloween Party but to far surpass
it. Bill Dorty's dining "kana pe was set up on a hilltop in the
lush clover field near the house. Ed Loud soon arrived and set
up his tarp alongside. Steve Kark had his stereo blasting music
over the countryside. Karl Hamm drove in with the hotdogs,
potato chips and 4 kegs of boer. Bill Stringfellow and Thor
Brecht set to work on the fire. Everyone was prepared to raiso
hell; the kegs would be tapped at 3. 3 o'clock came but the
tappers didn't. Doug Yeatts, who had the tappers, had not yet
arrived. People started to get impatient, banging empty beer
mugs on the sides of vehicles; the crowd was getting ugly. Just
in time though, Doug showed up and with a great rejoicing, the
beer flowed and flowed and flowed and then flowed some more.
The Picnio had begun! Once again the Pionio Chairman was
Ed Richardson aided by Jerry Redder. There was volleyball
playin', guitar pickin', banjo pickin', and drunkin' singin'.
Dale Parrott and Wes Thorne set out on motorcycles across the
fields followed by Dennis MoClevey in his TLC and Bob Page in
his orange rollerskate. As some sat around and shot the bull,
others shot frisbees. Bill Stringfellow had the hotdogs ready
just in time to foed the band of hungry @avers. As the night
fell, the fire was built up and everyone began to gather around
it. Sometime la ter people began to notice sone thing strange, it
Was Don Davison and Ed Richardson streaking with sparklers in
hand. Still later Cheryl Jones and Gill Ediger were found
sitting by the fire...... naked. This inspired a larger group
of people, reputedly led by Bill Douty, to streak the fire.
Meanwhile, Robyn Loud, Liz Morgan and Nancy Coleman conducted
a stroak of the house. Along about that time, Lor Windle gave a
show with the fireworks he had been saving for this occasion.
At midnight a group of people went up to the barn to frighten
each other in the dark and hear ghost stories by Mike Wolf, Dale
Parrott and other bizarre voices in the dark. The original 4
kegs wore killed early in the evening and a 5th keg was sent for.
In the early morning hours people started to look for convenient
places to crash, then the rain began. Most people stayed fairly
dry, Rick Cooper however decided that he could use the bath and
by morning he was soaked to the skin, right through his sleeping
bag.
