BARKS!
It ain't no use in fooling with your lamp, friend;
Your tip blew out with a pow!
And it ain't no use in reaching for your candle,
. You didn't bring it anyhow.
It wouldn't be so bad if the entrance was in view,
But its a thousand feet to daylight and I trusted in you,
Don't look to me for help 'cause I'm in trouble too.
No more light! It's a fright.
I wonder why I took you caving with me?
They all told me you're no good.
I've always thought that trainees should be trusted,
(We don't know all that we should.)
But when you hit me on the head and pushed me off the drop,
And drove a piton through my back and caused my eyes to
pop,
I wanted to do something, but my conscience made me stop.
'It's alright, an oversight.
I thought we ought to go and split my food up,
We might be here for awhile.
I was going to go and eat it myself, friend;
But you know that's not my style.
But when I reached into my pack to get the Milky Way,
You said you found a candy bar back in the last crawlway.
And you just couldn't stand to see it rot away.
It's a fright! Dark as night.
Well for days I've had to battle with my hunger,
If only there was some thing I could eat.
But I knew I never really had to worry,
I was on the sign-out sheet.
Well rescue came, I knew it would, after a week's delay:
To lead my tortured body back into the light of day,
They couldn't understand why I went solo anyway.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
(To the tune of "Don't Think Twice, It's Alright")
