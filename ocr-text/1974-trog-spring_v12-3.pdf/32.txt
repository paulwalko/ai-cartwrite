THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1974
This cave appears to be located in the Witten formation--a
very shaley limestone lying above the Wassum and Chatham Hill.
This probably accounts for its sharp, razor blade texture, The
cave was very dip orientated, falling off sharply into the moun-
tain in a series of parallel and branching fissures leading off
the entrance dome pit. Total passage seen was about 400 feet.
After pulling up the rope and ladder, we returned northeast
across the ridge to Yahoo Cave. Since we were already wet, Doug
and I decided to enter. After securing the ladder in, I squeezed
under the tree roots and waterfall, Doug proceeded hastily be-
hind me and relit my lamp which I had extinguished by falling
flat on my face, We then quickly descended the ladder. for it
hung within the limits of the waterfall, and it did not seem
very refreshing to linger about, We found ourselves in a large
fissure passage looking down as the stream cascaded down across
the breakdown covered floor. The ceiling was very high and re-
minded me of the entrance passage in Newberry's or Clover Hollow,
Following the passage for about 200-300 feet, it remained
large in front of us. We could not proceed further, however. In
front of us lay a slit, or canyon; the water sinking and rush-
ing out over a 50 foot drop. We were impressed! After searching
awhile for a dry rigging point up and to the right of the canyon,
we again returned to the surface. As before, there were also high
leads, and as before, we must return.
CONCLUSION:
I believe that it is obvious that there is more to Big Walker
than meets the eye. If three short weekend ventures can turn up
two completely virgin caves with every reason in the world to keep
going, then what limits other possibilities along the entire
ridge? One simply needs to look in the right places, and be
masochistic enough to enjoy walking up steep slopes, swatting
gnats, and fighting off blackberry bushes, Who knows, perhaps
another Miller's is just around the next knoll. But then again,
this is Giles County, "THE CAVED OUT COUNTY " of Virginia......
