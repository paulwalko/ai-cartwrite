SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1974
NOTICE ANYTHING ?
I SURE HOPE SO!! If not, then stop here
and come back when you're awake or sober.
Yes, many things have changed, and I hope
the stops taken away from TRIDITION won't
stop hore.
I'd like to see the TROG make the most
out of the great potential that has been
overlooked for years...and this issue is
a good start. But I need sugestions,
ideas, and of course, material to publish.
I'd like to see more articles from sources
outside the club, especially if the ideas
presented are contrary to those generally
accepted by our Grotto.
Let's work to take the ho-hum morning mouth
feeling out of the TROG! This issue can
be just a beginning, and an experiment.
I need your help, though. After all,
Last quarter i couldn't even spel editer,
and now I are one!
