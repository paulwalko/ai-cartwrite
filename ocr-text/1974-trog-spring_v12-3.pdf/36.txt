Friday, October 6, 1973; 10:30 p.m."
We're sitting in the Mud River Express in front of a ga's
station watching the owner, shirtless, but with his gun in hand,
leave his nearby house and approach the car. The man was looking
for an explanation,
So began a weekend that rolled my sense of time up into a
little clay ball and hid it from me, Mike Conefrey, Keith Ortiz,
and I were heading for Mingo, West Virginia, to take part in the
Virginia Region's project, SIMMER (Simmon's-Mingo, Elk River),
sponsered by the Potomac Speleological Club at Simmon's-Mingo
Cave, Mike and I were to meet Dale Parrott at the expedition site
to link up and form the photography team. My car had died in
front of the gas station, one hundred miles from Mingo.
The station owner accepted our explanation, and some of our
beer. He brought out a little of his wine and took us on a two
hour tour of the local color while he tried to find us a fuel ;
pump we didn't need,
The remainder of the trip went smoothly; the car died once
more, the starter drive destroyed itself, and we ran out of gas
just past the last gate to the camp ground at 4:30 a.m. Saturday
morning.
After pushing the car down the side of the hill, we continued Q
to the large tent. Maybe three people were up in the entire camp
site. We had warned them of our coming by use of the field phone
at the first gate on the dirt road.
We got to pay our registration fee at the "operations" tent.
This was a structure framed by two by two's which were covered
with clear plastic, Inside, there was a row of tables, an op-
erations flow chart, and a modest pile of phone equipment.
We shuffled through the papers on the table, signing regis-
tration forms, information forms, and release forms. After
suffering through the taking of identification pictures, we climbed
into the back of the car and slept.
We slept soundly until Dale found us at 7:30 a.m. We pulled
ourselves together enough to complain ineffectively for about
five minutes before getting up,
The kitchen complex was downhill from the operations tent
and built the same. It had a well outfitted kitchen that provided o
us with a good breakfast. We met Grayson Harding, who was lining
up the recording of the expedition, and were briefed on what was
expected of us,
