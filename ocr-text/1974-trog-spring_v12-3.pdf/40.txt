How the final irreparation was reconciled,

Editor's note: The story you are about to read is an
extrapolation of the author's brain. Such events are con-
sidered theoretically possible and could conceptually occur
in the not-too-distant future in his view point. Any relation
between persons, places, or thingies, living or deadsy, is just
a shame because I ain't changin' nothin'!
No shit guys, once upon a time these events really occurred.
I should know, I was one of the major participants (barring the
immortals and non-mortals involved) in the events which I am about
to relate to you (if I ever stop jabbering and get on with it).
I suppose I should start the tale where it began, at the be-
ginning. The beginning was a blah cave trip to which I had com-
mitted myself. We were going to Toidy Cave for an easy three hour
trip. Had we had any inkling of the changes we would bring about
or the consternation we would cause, we might have thought twice,
yea--three times, before entering. But we did not think at all,
Even as we entered the sinkhole in which Toidy was located,
everything seemed normal. Here it was Saturday, just six days
before a week from Friday: The sun was high in the sky as it
tends to do in the middle of the day, and the leaves were green
as their electrons absorbed light from the red, or low, energy
spectra. We dropped down the sixty foot pit and ambled along the
stream, It was not until we entered a shit crawl near the end
of the cave that we first noticed some unusual things. Most ap-
parent was the fact that none of us were suffering from hangovers
anymore. Actually, if one hangs around Beak Ropeguy and that
coke drinking crowd one does not get hangovers Tone tends to rot
out one's teeth and become obese, though). However, we did no-
tice several things that were strikingly curious. The acrid smell
of brimstone (and, of course, brimstone pools) and fire were
titillating our nasal cavaties and the heat was starting to make
our sweat (excuse me; perspiration) glands sit up and take notice.
Our party was becoming increasingly wary due to these factors
and it was only through a superhuman effort on my part that I
managed to kick the more cowardly members back into line (I was
