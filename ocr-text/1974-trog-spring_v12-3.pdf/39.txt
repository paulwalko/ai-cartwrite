SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
To make a long story short, it took us fifteen hours to get
out of the cave. We took a lot of time for photography once :
again, Our trip ended at 12:33 Monday afternoon, after fifty
hours, forty minutes underground. Once on the surface, someone
handed me a can of Tuborg beer, and I waited to catch Gene
Harrison (who had threatened combat if he wasn't last man out)
get a cold Dr. Pepper dumped on him. Squinting in the unfamiliar
light, I found that the camp and even my car, were still out there,
We were treated to a debriefing, meal, and shower we felt
we deserved. When I ascertained that Keith had abandoned us, I
was able to get the Mud River Express started with help from a
chain and a pickup truck, Mike and I had an uneventful trip
back to Blacksburg, which might have been compared to a clock
unwinding.
