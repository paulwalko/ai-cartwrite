irregular and its outcrop trace reflects these irregularities
rather srikingly. The overlying Middle Ordovician Series is
well represented by various gray limestone units totaling about
800 feet. These limestones are overlain by approximately 50 to
200 feet of red Moccasin shale."
Moon continues to further describe beds of Ordivician and
Silurian shales and sandstones which cap the mountain.
SO WHAT ABOUT CAVES :
It is the 800 feet of limestones that concern us.
Beginning with the Wassum and Chatham Hill formations (coming
down the ridge) we enter prime cave forming rock as testified.
by the presence of both Miller's and Salamander. These caves
enter at the contact between the Wassum and Chatham Hill.
Their entrances vary in altitude by only about twenty feet,
according to the preliminary data, and the distance between the
two is approximately five miles. Both are long vertical mazes.
In observing cave locations plotted out on a Geologic map
of the area, it becomes quite apparent that a pattern exists.
Almost all of the larger caves are found to lie in a narrow band
between 2,300 and 2,400 feet, coinciding with the Chatham Hill
formation. These caves also seem to occur primarily at the bottom
or on the sides of errosional gulleys. Included here are
Salamander, Millers, Newberry's, Bane's, and Buddy Penly's.
This area of the mountain is a bit higher and steeper than
the Casual roamer really cares to bother with, Being often
wooded, covered with brambles and cut through by deep gulleys, it
is indeed and in essence, "a pain in the ass" to walk. This is
however, in my opinion, precisely where the pay off shall be had.
EARLIER KNOWN AND PLOTTED CAVES :
Previous to current studies, only nine caves had been posi-
tively located and explored within the boundries described earlier,
These include (east to west) Carr's #2, Miller's, Francis' #1,
Bill Bane's, Sam Francis'. Vest's #1, Vest's #2, Bretcherd's and
Salamander. At least two other cave locations had been described
by land owners, (on J.J. Vest's and R. Francis' property) but these
had not been explored prior to this study.
Of these known caves, only two, aside from Miller's and
Salamander, seem to have any possible potential. These are Francis'
#1 and Carr's #2. The remaining caves are all F.R.O.'s as desig-
nated in Caves of Virginia, and most are confirmed by my field
work in the area. These F.R.O.'s all lie low within the valley
(most within the Knox Group) and again add evidence of a lacking
knowledge of the structure of the mountain and a lacking energy
to explore above, "where the good stuff is". -
