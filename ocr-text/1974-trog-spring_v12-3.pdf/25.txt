SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1974
PENDULUM
The first time that he saw the pit, the water fall was pourin'.
Mist hung heavy in the air, but the pit was callin'.
Rigged in on a seven-trip through fog and wind and rain;
Seven sixteenths perlon tryin' to take the strain...
Seven sixteenths perlon tryin' to take the strain.
Rigging in on bottom, near the water's roar;
He's taking up the slack and now he's clear off the floor.
Water slams his body; his helmet's driven down,
Light's gone out, cold sets in, and darkness all around,..
Light's gone out, cold sets in, and darkness all around.
Five hundred feet above him that he cannot see;
Creeping slowly up the rope--now foot, now chest, now knee.
From drowning in the fury to freezing in the rain,
Though slow and steady wins the race, he cannot feel the pain...
Though slow and steady wins the race, he cannot feel the pain.
He cannot count his steps now, his concentration's gone.
Fatigue has robbed his body of the will to carry on
His legs and arms hang leaden as his temperature goes down;
His mind it wanders freely 'round about the town...
His mind it wanders freely 'round about some town,
They tried to shout on down to him, but he could not hear.
The hole was small. The load was large, They could not use their
gear,
He died there in the silence of the trickle and the roar;
You will not see him caving in your underground no more...
You will not see him caving in your under cround na more
