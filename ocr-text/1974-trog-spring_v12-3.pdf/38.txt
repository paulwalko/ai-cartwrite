SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1974
When we got to Base Camp, it was empty. Gear was haphazardly
distributed up and down a passage that was about eight feet wide,
and fifty feet long. The telephone was in the middle. Carts and
Queissar had just seen ET-2 and "Mapping" across the lake. The
mapping crew was all VPI: Bill Douty, Tom Roehr, and Cheryl
Jones. ET-2 included Jim Denton from VPI.
Base Camp had been established early Saturday morning. The
first crews carried most of their own supplies in, the rest were
coming with Supply Teams #1 and#2. There had been a shortage of
sleeping bags and Stan had spent the night sitting on the ground.
A tired and drippy group of cavers who called themselves ET-1,
returned to camp with tales of rubber rafts, drops, and skinny
dips in sumps. After all was told, we crawled into our warm =
sleeping bags and slept soundly for about an hour. When enough
of our initial exhaustion had been sucked off by sleep, and
enough of our body heat had been sucked off by the dampmess and
breeze in the passage, everyone went through phases of shivering,
fitful dozing and wakefulness,
About 4:30 a.m., ET-2 returned. "Mapping" returned about
6:00:a.m. They were pretty demanding about their rights to sleep-
ing bags!
Exploration beyond the lake was one of the major objectives
of the whole expedition. An estimated three thousand feet of.
passage had been discovered, along with the previous discovery
of a stream passage, ET-1 (Kirk MacGregor, Bob Vogue and Al
Krause) plus Stan Carts and the photo team set out to cross the
lake on the third expedition across.
The lake was entered through a low stream passage that opened
out to water passage about forty-five feet long and fifteen feet
wide. The depth was unknown. The entrance crossing was managed
on a two man rubber raft, one man at a time. We had to jump into
the raft, carefully, at the Base Camp side, and step out back-
wards into knee deep mud on the far side. The raft was great;
it leaked air, had two inches of water in the bottom, and the air
valve tended to jam, We had the reassurance of hearing air rush
out as we crossed the lake, After unjamming the valve then drop-
ping it (fortunately to the bottom of the raft), and reassembling
the air pump after it had come apart, we were confident about .
getting back across the lake.
Returning to Base Camp and looking forward to another com-
fortable sleep, we threatened to throw ET-2 and "Mapping" out of
bed, physically. Everyone was a little ornery by now and were
freely venting their feelings about the operation and taking out
aggressions on the phone. The phone had been a constant pesti-
lence, and was symbolic of the misunderstandings between Operations
and the crews underground. Stan finally put an end to two way
communications,
"Hello, Hello? Are you pushing the button? You're coming
in garbled. (aside) Gee I hope they fix this phone, Hello, Hello?
If anyone can hear me, the photo group is moving out. If you
can hear me, ring the phone;" The phone rings.
