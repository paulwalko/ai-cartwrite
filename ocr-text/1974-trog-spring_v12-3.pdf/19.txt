for the main stream in Smoke Hole. The main stream now has broken
the strike orientation and flows due south for 1,000 feet to the
spring on Sinking Creek. The abandoned passage is at or just above
base level then, and ends in breakdown. A small stream in it
disappears to the southwest. Plans have been made to dye trace this
small stream. If the overland entrance to entrance survey and the
two cave surveys are accurate, then it appears that the Tawney's
Cave stream comes out of the middle of Smoke Hole Cave: Then again,
perhaps it wiggles in the gap which separates the two caves, coming
updip from the northwest. Either way, something interesting is afoot.
IV. HEADWATER PIRACY AT THE ATLANTIC-GULF DIVIDE:
The headwaters of Sinking Creek, interestingly, are not at
the head of the Sinking Creek Valley, but rather five miles down
the valley. From the headwaters to the end of Sinking Creek on the
New River, which flows via the Ohio and Mississippi River to the
Gulf, the Creek drops 1,000 feet in elevation in twenty-five miles,
for a gradient of about forty feet per mile. Drainage in the eastern
five miles of Sinking Creek Valley, in contrast, flows to Craig
Creek, and then to the Atlantic, dropping 1,300 feet in eight miles
from the headwaters, or 160 feet per mile. Drainage of the first
four miles of the five for which Atlantic drainage flows in Sinking
Creek Valley is predominantly underground, reappearing at two large
springs to form Meadow Creek. An unknown group dye-traced a sinking
stream about a mile to one of these springs.
It appears that drainage at the head of Sinking Creek Valley
once flowed west to New River. Helped by a steeper gradient to
Craig Creek to the east, and by the anticlinal plunge to the east,
drainage at the head of Sinking Creek Valley was pirated to the east,
The divide between Gulf and Atlantic drainage, called "the Alle
ghany" by local residents, has thus probably moved westward as
more drainage was captured by Meadow Creek. The two drainage basins,
Sinking Creek and Meadow Creek, show different cave densities.
Although cave hunting in the eastern end of the Sinking Creek Valley
has not been thorough, the known cave passage density is several
times lower here than in the Meadow Creek drainage directly across
the divide. The lithology is similar, but the drainage gradient is
fourfold higher to the east than to the west and fractures due to
the plunge of the anticline may be more numerous. This high gradient
apparently confers the same advantage for cave development as an
entrenched river does in other locales. A thorough search for caves
is needed on both sides of the divide. More dye tracing there is
also intended.
V. THE STRENGTH OF STRIKE ORIENTATION :
One of the foremost questions unresolved in my mind about
cave development in folded rocks as in Virginia, Maryland,
Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia is the
stringency of strike control of passage (drainage) orientation.
