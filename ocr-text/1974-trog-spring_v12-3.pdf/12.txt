CAVE RESCUE
COMMUNICATIONS
NETWORK:
from the inside out
- Editors note: The following was compiled from a brain-
picking session with Steve Gates (NSS 12212), who is actively
involved with the CRCN, based at University of Virginia.
"The purpose of CRCN) is to provide competent, experienced
and level headed cavers at the scene of and accident or emergency
to assist in clearing the situation up and getting people out....
The actual rescue personnel might well be the local emergency
crew. As it's set up, if we have a bad injury that will require
medical equipment, they're going to be the ones who will have to
provide it.
If some one were to call the CRCN, the call would come to the
University Police here in Charlottesville. We ask the police to
get the name of the caller, the number where he can be reached,
information such as the name and location of the cave, the nature
of the incident, the number of people involved and what kind of
special equipment, if any, will be needed for the rescue, The
University Police would then call me or one of several other people
around town who have a call down list...of cavers from all over
the region. It's arranged so we're not out of town at the same
time--some one is always here. We would then call the person who
called the police in the first place, and find out more details
and maxe sure things are as the police had told us. The idea
here is to have a fail safe system, because in an emergency situ-
ation people often get confused. If the information the police
relates to us...is the same as we hear when we call back five min-
utes later, then we have a pretty good idea that it is correct.
We would then call the people from the list which are the
closest to the cave, tell them the situation, and try to arrange
for a rescue. Ideally, no cave in Virginia or West Virginia(with-
in the Virginia Region) is more than an hour and a half from help.
The system has been used satisfactorily. I've had three
calls, I believe, since the fall region meeting. We were able to
get people on the scene within half an hour and help get the
cavers out...although one group had rescued themselves before
we left Charlottesville,
.... There are some grottos who have not cooperated (with
efforts to compile a complete call down list) at all.
