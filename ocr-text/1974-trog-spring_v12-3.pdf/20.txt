THE TECH TROGLODYTE
Certainly in areas with synclinal or anticlinal structural features
dip orientation will increase in prominence. Lithology will often
force a strike orientation, particularly if the carbonate beds are
not very thick. But under what conditions will the passage or-
entation be independant of dip or strike in rocks with a sig-
nificant dip? Sinking Creek Valley is not the best place to answer
this question, but a characterization of the underground drainage
there should aid in answering the question. Will streams in Pig
Hole Cave and small caves on the north slope of Spruce Run Mountain
drain along the strike to the New River 4-5 miles away, or to
Sinking Creek a mile or less away? A series of dye tracings are
planned to answer these questions.
The Sinking Creek Valley contains interesting examples of
phenomena of karst hydrology and geomorphology. The project that
Keith Ortiz and I have planned has much work to be done in cave
discovery, survey, and water tracing. Offers of assistance from
interested persons will be appreciated.
the virginia spring survey:
A major advantage of an organized Cave Survey is that discovery
and description are made more efficient by the recording, storage,
and dissemination of cave information. This efficiency is further
increased if cave biologists, hydrologists, and geologists work
together, forwarding information which is of interest not only to
themselves, but to each other. It is only with this type of co
operation and cross feeding that projects which encompass areas
larger than a single cave are possible, because the independant
effort required to locate and describe the caves and springs of
an area, and then formulate hypotheses about the cave development
and hydrology in that region, may be beyond the resources of any
group contemplating the project,
After discussions with Phil Lucas, the current head of the
Virginia Cave Survey, I wish to propose a Virginia Spring Survey.
Actually, this survey will be part of the Virginia Cave Survey,
and will be part of a more integrated approach to karst research
in Virginia.
Why should the caver concern himself with springs? Any ex-
perienced caver knows that when looking for new caves, one should
always inquire about the presence of caves, holes, pits, and
springs in an area. A cave to many locals is an opening big
enough to comfortably crawl or walk into. But to a caver, a cave
is any opening which can be entered in any way, even uncomfortably.
Many springs can be pushed during low water, and lead to caves.
Low water periods, usually July to November, are the best times to
check out for possible entry.
If the spring itself is not enterable, often a seasonal
overflow route is. Again, the overflow route will be flooded dur-
ing high water, but may be dry or damp in times of low water, as
exemplified by Old Mill Cave in Montgomery County. In some
