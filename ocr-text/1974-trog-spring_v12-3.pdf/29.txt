SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE__
1974
:Carris #2, although not as high up as the others, (elev, 2160)
is described as seeming to be filled at one end with a mud flow.
The cave's total length is only about 175 feet however, and offers
only little potential. The cave was explored and described fully
in the late forties. I have not yet visited this one, but it's
probably safe to scratch it off the list.
Francis' #1 is the only one left to offer hope, The cave is
located at almost the exact elevation as Salamander and Miller's,
and also along the same contactThe cave has a large fifteen
foot diameter moss covered entrance lying within a wooded gulley.
It appears that runoff flowing through the gulley sinks here as
it reaches the permiable limestone layers.
Mike Frame, Lor Windle and myself visited Francis' #1 in
late April, being interested in its "un-rat holish" appearance on
a sketch map and description given by Earl Thierry in 1948, He
describes the cave as follows:
"The entrance consisted of a sink hole covered over with
heavy logs, the hole being about fifteen feet in diameter and
twenty feet deep. The length of the cave was about 220 feet with
a total difference in elevation of about sixty feet. The pas-
sages were narrow with several vertical drops and the cave termin-
ated in a small drain hole right at the bottom which could not be
investigated because of its small size, Water was dripping down
and stones could be tossed down for about twenty feet further."
Upon examining this drain hole, we came to the same con-
clusion; although tossing stones down reminded one of the Miller's
discovery. The hole is being slowly closed off by flowstone, and
seems to drain the entire cave. Looking through the hole, it
appears to bell out over a small drop to a room below. A very
thin person may be able to squeeze through, but due to water and
the nature of the hole upon returning, severe difficulties may be
encountered, Dynamite and/or picks seem to be the only solution,
and a rather poor one at that.
WHERE THE GOOD STUFF IS:
Salamander Cave was discovered only four years ago by a
small group from Radford and Dublin, With exploration and map-
ping efforts still in progress, it has long since proven to be
a very long and challenging cave. Its characteristics show it
very similar in nature to Miller's and Newberry's as well as to
others mentioned previously. It plunges along dip, deep into the
mountain and then sprawls outward along strike in a complex maze
network.
Roaring Spring Cave:
Salamander and Miller's lie almost exactly five miles apart,
In the center lies Francis' #1. Could it be possible that a sys-
tem between these three exists, or perhaps in the other direction,
toward Bane's Spring and Newberry's (also five miles southwest of
