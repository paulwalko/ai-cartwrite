few entrances closer to the park, Hope so. How were the mappers
and vandals getting inside the system? Some C.R.F. member must
have violated his vow of secrecy under pressure.
After accepting the alliance offer, the directors discussed
the new regulations rationing survey stations. Mapping parties
would be allowed no more than fifty now, instead of the hundred
plus they were used to. They would try a new even-odd caving
rationing plan: Calendar date and the last digit on the old NSS
membership cards (NSS folded years before due to a split between
sport cavers and mappers.)
I wake up. It was a dream. Was it a good dream or a bad
dream? Well, I suppose it was worse than it was good, Better
rush out and get me my virgin passage and new survey data before
it is all gone. Don't want to be scooped any more than I am
already.
What is your solution to this problem? Do you consider it
a problem? The possibility that I'll run out of things to
discover and map in my own caves, let alone undiscovered caves,
is very disturbing. Can C.R.F. see the end in sight? If so,
what are they doing about it?
Some say slow down, don't map so fast. You can do this
when you have your cave "staked out;" closed to all but your
group.. But can you restrain your partner? It is the Tragedy of
the Commons again. If I voluntarily slow down my rate of mapping
and discovery, someone else will get what I give up. Virgin
Passage is a natural resource, We are rapidly depleting it.
Pretty soon all ceiling leads will be bolted, all digs dug, all
crevices chiseled open. Look at the East Coast cavers:
Partying has replaced gung-ho mapping. Maybe they got this from
the West Coast cavers. Bone-Norman Cave in West Virginia is being
mapped for the 5th time, Will it be the last? Some people are
satisfied with remapping. Perhaps if we made all remapping
seem like mapping the first time over, it would be better. Here's
where a policy of secrecy and non-publication would help. Then
everything could be independently rediscovered repeatedly.

captivity. I know...it almost happened to me,
once."
