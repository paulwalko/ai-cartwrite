SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE

taking up the rear, you understand). We reached the end of the
cave and were ready to make a dash for the exit when I noticed
a crevice descending down into the bowels of the earth. I had
been in this cave before and immediately recognized the fact that
the newly formed crevice must have occurred because of a bowel
movement,
Ever bold and adventurous, I coaxed the nearest trainee to
take a peek over the edge of the drop within the crevice. He
could see nothing below and suggested that we drop five pounds
of computer chips down the drop and see what happens. This was
a reasonable suggestion and I hastily led the party out to return
at a later date to conquer this drop.
It was seven days later (and by an amazing coincidence, also
a Saturday) when I returned with a new batch of trainees and three
super-cavers (excluding myself, of course). We hauled our tails
through the regular section of the cave and returned to the crack,
It was still there. Impressed as I was by this fact, I remained
undaunted in my desire to plunge on. We rigged the drop and rap-
pelled in (it was actually in the down direction, of course). I
never found out the exact depth of that drop, but there was enough
of our rope left at the bottom of the drop to lynch a basketball
star, tie up Houdini, and still trip over it. So our brave band
continued playing into the mountain. The path dropped and dropped
and, with the rigours of the trip, our mob started to drop.
Eventually, we became a group of three: myself, a trainee, and
a supercaver intent on digging out a siphon.
We came to see some pretty strange territory sown there. The
cave opened up into a huge vault room whose side walls extended
out beyond the light of our carbide lamps, As we were crossing
this room, we came upon a sight that froze our blood (circa -7Â°C).
The cave was inhabited!!
An old man was down there, leaning upon a long pole, He
stood beside a wide stream holding a small punt-like boat. Too
stunned even to think, we asked him for passage across the stream
(we had to be real cool about it). He mumbled something about
"sticks" or something like that, and then took us over the stream,
He again mumbled something about not returning, but I did not
catch his meaning. On the other side we were confronted by a
more horrible sight that allowed me to realize where we were,
The sight we saw was a huge three headed dog. I immediately
realized that the dog was Cerberus, and we were approaching the
Gates of Hell, I then knew that escape was futile and we could
never recross the River Styx, I decided to press on. Actually,
I fully intended to throw myself on the mercy of the courts and
offer my companions as compensation for being freed myself. For
this reason I strove ahead to talk to Satan before my friends
had a chance to shaft me,
Thus it was that we were met at the Gates of Hell by none
other than Satanachia, the commander of the satanic forces and
the influencer of women (convenient reference fact #17). I
knew that something was happening immediately we entered into
Hell by the fact that all the devils were mustering their forces
