It is 1984. Deep inside the Austin Bunker, in Flint Ridge,
the C.R.F. directors huddle, beyond the range of sound of picks,
shovels, and explosives, trying to figure out how to counter the
latest escalatory move by the opposition. One of their guards
has been literally blinded by the latest model of plastic
carbide lamp, wielded by an intruder. Always responsive to their
caving market, Justite had recently developed a lamp for just
this sort of conflict: A lamp with a quick release extra high
flame. The unfortunate Joint Venturer must have ventured too
far, for he had been found stuffed into an enlarged joint,
apparently after having been clubbed over the head repeatedly
with either a sledge hammer or a speleothem-like object. He
must not have had time to thunder-pop his lamp and bring down the
ceiling on his invaders.
The directors are discussing the offer of the Sport Caver's
Federation to form an alliance. Since the river rose in January,
the first connection with Mammoth has been flooded shut. Crews
were working on enlarging the Second Connection, but were usually
needed either on guard duty or to sneak supplies through the
several small secret entrances on Flint Ridge. All the entrances
to the system that the caving public knew about had been
necessarily blasted shut from the inside, Supplies were getting
dangerously low, and manpower was in short supply. The enemy's
long siege of the C.R.F. in Flint Ridge must be ended! The recent
alliance of the hard ass cavers in MAP (Map All Passages) with
SMASH (Society for the Marketing of Anthodites, Stalagmites, and
Helectites) had tightened the noose around the neck of the.
Foundation, The MAPers wanted CRF to share the only virgin
passage left in North America with them, to stop hoarding it.
The vandals and flowstone miners of SMASH wanted access to the
only unvandalized caves left in North America. It was a
marriage of convenience, but not something strongly against either's
principles.
The Sport Caver's Federation had offered to bring in supplies
in return for seeing parts of the Flint Ridge System. The
na tural hostility of the sport caver for the mappers and vice-
versa, plus the chance to see some of the famed Flint Ridge
System, had caused the offer to be made, even if it did mean
hauling stuff in through distant burned out caves like Crumps.
Maybe C.R.F. would open up their secret book and tell them of a
