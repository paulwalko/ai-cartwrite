IS BAT NE
Hellhole Cave of Pendleton County, West Virginia, has become
the focal point of the struggle to give two rare species of bats
a fighting chance for survival. Hellhole Cave contains the larg-
est known hibernating colong of the Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis)
east of Kentucky and the easternmost known nursery colony of the
long-eared bat (Plecotus townsendii). It also contains a signif-
icantly large hibernating colony of the little brown bat (Myotis
lucifufus). The Indianna bat and the long-eared bat have been
recognized by scientists and conservationists as being in danger
of extinction. The Indiana bat is already included on the U.S.
Department of the Interior's Rare and Endangered Species list.
In recognition of the gravity of the situation, the NSS
Board of Governors, at their November 3, 1973, meeting in Los
Angeles, passed a resolution supporting and encouraging a "vol-
entary year-round moratorium on NSS caving trips into Hellhole
Cave,... until Juch time as alternative beneficial action can be
taken; and...requests all cavers, regardless of affiliation, to
honor this moratorium,"
We sincerely hope that all cavers, regardless of affiliation,
will carefully consider the importance and necessity of this de-
cision, Hellhole Cave is to be assumed bat-sensitive year-round,
not merely during the hibernating season as was once thought.
This assumption is based on scientific evidence, not on hysteria
or sentimentality. It has been found that for summer nursery col-
onies, visitation appears to increase perceptiby the number of
accidents to young bats, and also higher first-year mortality
rates have been noted among young bats. This results from the
inability of many of them to accumulate enough fat reserves to
last until spring. Perhaps after appropriate study, it will be
found that at certain times of the year (for example, during the
first two weeks of October), caver disturbance may do little or
no harm to the bat colonies. However, until such study is made,
we must assume (for the sake of the bats) that caver disturbance
is highly detrimental.
Dr. John S, Hall of Albright College, Reading, Pa., will
attempt to assess the situation at Hellhole Cave as quickly as
possible and will report to the National Speleological Society
membership, and the caving world at large, at the earliest oppor-
tunity (via and NSS Bulletin article), but in the meantime we
ask all cavers to cooperate fully with this important resolution.
Thank you for your cooperation and concern, .
