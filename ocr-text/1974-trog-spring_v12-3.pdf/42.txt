SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE

and looking, for all intents and purposes, as if they intended
to attack the surface world. I was wrong, though,
It was several hours later, after I had conferred with the
great Lucifer himself, that I realized exactly how much my guess
had been off. I was brought up to the great one's abode and looked
upon him with awe. He condescendingly spoke to me, We conversed
for a while upon the topic I was most interested in the pur-
pose for the grand armies forming in Hell. As he talked it all
became clear to me--the reason for the world situation, the lack
of kindness in the world, and the price of tea in China,
As it turned out, Lucifer was not going to attack the sur-
face worlds he was going to attack heaven (again). As you all re-
member, Lucifer was the number two seraphim and tried to take over
the place. The son of God, however, led the loyalist forces and
God cast them (the fascisti) into the netherworld, Several mil-.
tenis had past and the devilish host had grown. For every angel,
five had come to Hell. The time to strike had come, Lucifer
informed me that he was going to lead his forces back to heaven
to reclaim, at least, the territory they had forfeited at the
last encounter. He bade me farewell and my friends and I were
escorted back to the mouth of the cave.
I returned back into the regular world while in a daze, I
would never have believed the story myself except for the fact
that about three days later there was a thunder and lightening
and a rending of the clouds unlike anything ever seen before.
It occurred to me that this must be the heavenly battle that
Lucifer had sworn to fight. I feared for the worse and then,
suddenly, came upon a mighty plan,
I was right in fearing the worst. Even with the quantitative
superiority, the devils were far overwhelmed. Cast again into
Hell, the devils were still beset by various cherubim; for God
had decided to inflict great damage upon them. The dark forces
were forced across the River Styx and slowly beaten back through
the Gates of Hell. Everything looked finished for the satanic
minions when a final surge of holy power swept them into the very
courtyard of Lucifer's palace. Then it happened,
From every pit and from behind every rock a caver sprang.
Dozens more rappelled down from above. With a mighty YAHOO they
popped their beer cans and belched in the angels faces.
Awed by this display of might, the heavenly forces fell back.
The cavers still advanced and the retreat became a rout. Soon
devils were hacking away and the high army was destroyed. As
consequences, God was cast out of his house and Lucifer began a
new reign as Lord of the Earth, bringing peace and entertainment
to the entire world,
THE STORY'S MORAL--
PLAIN TO TELL :
IT TAKES A CAVER
TO RAISE HELL!
