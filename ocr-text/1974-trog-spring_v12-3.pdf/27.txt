SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE_
1974
Since the existance of Salamander became known to me last
spring my interest in Big Walker has grown considerably.
Although the entire ridge warrants great attention, I have
chosen to concentrate my efforts on that region which lies in
Giles Co. and includes both Salamander and Miller's. This area
specifically is the northwest slope of Big Walker, bordered on
the west by Bland Co., on the east by route 100 and to the
north by Big Walker Creek. References can be made to the 7.5
minute White Gate Quad.
A GENERAL GEOLOGY:
All of the rocks exposed in this region are of a marine
sedimentary nature with a total thickness of about 5,300 feet.
Maximum relief of the ridge is 1669 feet at an elevation of 3353
feet. This section of the ridge consists basically of fifteen
rock formations striking northeast with the mountain and dipping
southeast into the mountain. The ridge is capped with shale and
sandstone units which also run down the southeast slope, thus
accounting for the lack of caves in that area. The various
formations are diagramed below in ascending order.

The following is an excerpt from William A. Moon Jr.'s
masters thesis, "Geology of the Poplar Hill Area" (1961) pp. 6-7,
describing the general construction of the ridge:
"The lowest Ordovician unit present (makes up most of the
lower valley), is the limestone and cherty dolomite sequence of
the Knox dolomite group. The thickness of the entire Knox group
is approximately 2,250 feet thick. At the top of the Knox group
is a profound erosional unconformity. The surface is highly
