stream has yet been found in Salamander, Miller's has a stream,
but it appears to be flowing in the wrong direction. Water in
the valley generally runs southwest to north east. Salamander is
about two miles southwest of Roaring Spring.
Vest's Regret and Yahoo:
The Vest's property lies about one and a fourth miles south-
west of Robert Francis' place, Don Anderson, while caving in
the Salamander area about a year before, had received a lead and
letter of permission from Mr. J.J. Vest to visit an unlisted cave
on his property. (Now dubbed Vest's #3.)
The weekend following the Roaring Spring Trip, Don, Mike,
Doug and myself decided to go and check this out and perhaps
also walk some more of the ridge above. After checking several
F.R.O.'s already listed in the area, we sought out and quickly
found Vest's #3. Again being low in the valley, this turned out
also to be an F.R.0.; and a trash filled F.R.0, at that,
Returning to the mountainside after much contemplation and
a milk shake dinner, we again began our trek, our goal being a
sink hole just at the shale-limestone contact. We reached the
contact soon enough and began walking parallel with it around the
wooded ridge. Again within an hour Mike had found a cave, this
one, also in a gulley, was a small two foot diameter hole draining
a small stream coming off the sandstone and shale above, In-
stead of getting totally drenched in the waterfall which entered,
we moved on.
Over the next two knolls, Mike came across another entrance.
Entering the 3.6 1.5 foot hole under a slab covered bluff on the
side of the wooded gulley, it became obvious that we could not
proceed further. Down the shoot and straight ahead about five
feet was a smooth walled pit about thirty feet deep. We hap-
pily retreated on back down the mountain and home to gather rope
and people for the next day's assault.
Conning Don Anderson into taking his jeep, we also gathered
up Robyn Loud, Lor, and Doug's roommate, and returned that Sunday.
Going first to the water sink hole, Mike descended part way on
belay. As he squeezed through the tree roots and the waterfall
closed in over his face, an exclamation rang out: "YAAAAHO0000!"
The cave had been named!
Returning quickly to the surface, Mike said he could go no
further without a ladder as the water gushed out over a 15-20 foot
Newberry's-like fissure. Since we weren't all too delighted with
the aspect of getting totally soaked right then, we decided to
visit the other cave, now dubbed Vest's Regret..
After rigging the very promising 30 foot entrance drop, we
all descended and spread out to find our cave. This one turned
out not to be virgin, but it might as well have been, for we
spent four hours crawling through the sharpest, narrowest, flesh
ripping passage I've seen in a long time. The fissures keep go-
ing, but there ain't nobody who is gonna fit through: So we not
so hastily retreated along with torn pants, jackets, shredded
knees and elbows,
