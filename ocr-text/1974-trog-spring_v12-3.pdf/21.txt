SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
places entry can be gained to a cave through an old resurgence,
which now lies somewhat above the spring, but often connected to
the cave stream which resurges at the spring. Thus, the presence
of a spring, especially a large spring, should prompt a search
for a cave associated with it.
A knowledge of the springs in a cave area is essential if
water tracing from caves is to be done. Cave stream tracing
usually comes after the mapping of the cave or caves, and is
used together with cave maps to draw conclusions about cave de-
velopment and water flow in the area. It is particularly useful
in areas where known caves are small and represent just fragments
of former flow systems. This is the situation in many parts of
Virginia.
It is important to make the location of springs a normal
part of ridgewalking and cave survey. While some. springs are marked
on topo maps, most are not. The volume of water issuing from
a spring has little to do with its being marked on the topo,
More important is the proximity of the spring to a road. I know
of two springs in Kentucky which are not marked on the topo, and
which were not known by the U.S. Geological Survey, yet both were
discharging 1-2 cubic feet per second in low water, twice as much
as the nearest spring marked on the topo. The unmarked ones were
half a mile from the road, the marked on 500 feet.
Report Spring locations to Phil Lucas (Rt, 3, Box 131,
Staunton, Va. 24401) just as you would cave locations. Include
a description containing an estimate of discharge (or a comparison
with another spring), potential as a cave entrance, whether or
not it is used as a domestic water supply, and the date. The date
is important because someone else may want to revisit the spring
if the original visit was in a month which usually has high water.

elmt tours?
In a recent (?) issue of Descent magazine (the "good laugh"
reply to Ascent), it was suggested that anyone traveling through
our area should stop by and ask the VPI Cave Club about Ed Loud
Memorial Toilets... and be sure to be shown one! (Anyone who
could render the TROG staff a copy of this issue for the exact
wording, will be immortalized in the origional E.L.M.T.)
