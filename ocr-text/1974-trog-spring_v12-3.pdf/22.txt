THE NEW
BEACON CAVE
SURVEY
Beacon Cave is located in Middle Ordivician limestone on
the north side of East River Mountain, West Virginia. The new
survey, headed by Guy turenne, was undertaken to remedy the glar-
ing flaws in the old map (Bunker, Janke, and Eaton, 1958), which
failed to show much of the well known passage.
The mapping began in 1971 and was "completed" in 1974,
As a result, Beacon Cave now stands at 15,000+ feet, with passage
still not mapped. The existence of an entrance at the far up-
stream end now looks very improbable, but still has not been dis-
proven. An entrance in the far downstream section, beyond the
large pool, has been inferred, but not proven, as it seems pass-
able only to air, leaves and cave rats; not to light or cavers.
A concentrated effort to find access to the passage above the large
waterfall proved a failure, and it seems the only way up is to
bolt 40-45 feet on an overhang of badly weathered limestone,
The down stream formation section, with its massive stalag-
mites and bacon rinds, has been heavily vandalized, many formations
evidently having been smashed just for the "fun" of it.
If the above news is not bad enough, Beacon should now be con-
sidered a "closed" cave. The last mapping crew came very close to
being arrested. The initial effort by the landowner to bulldoze
the Beacon entrance shut failed, so as of this writing, it is still
possible to get in. This may not be true for long. The Haynes'
entrance has been permanently and thoroughly closed.
All prior efforts to prevent the total and permanent loss
of this cave have failed, but Bob Alderson has now agreed to try
once more, If his efforts fail, then we will have lost one of the
finest horizontal caves in this area,
