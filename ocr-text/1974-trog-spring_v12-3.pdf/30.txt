Salamander)? Well, that's a bit far fetched, but none the less,
a remote possibility. In any case, many other separate caves
could exist between, and with this in mind, Mike, Lor and myself
(during the Francis' #1 trip) set out to ridge walk along Robert
Francis' property. We set out following a shallow gourge with
a stream in its base, In no more than half an hour it led us up
to a steep wooded outcropping, beneath which the stream originated
as a large gushing spring. This was neither noted on the topo,
nor in Caves of Virginia. Working our way up to a promising look-
ing slit in the rocks, we found a good amount of air flow, but no
access due to breakdown blocking the way. With further searching
and poking about in loose rocks, we finally found a small fist-
sized opening just above the outcropping's face. With our faces
in the dirt, and a bit of frantic mole digging, we managed to
open the hole just large enough to cram Lor through head first.
After about ten minutes and amidst curses and shrieks, Lor sur-
faced to describe a small room with many stalactites hanging over
a large pool and flowing water. The stream appeared to siphon
just beyond. So, with broken hearts, we headed to Francis' #1,
and finally, home.
In early May, however, Lor and I returned, along with Don
Anderson, Herb Safford and Doug Olson. I descended the rat hole
this time and found the water to be a bit lower and worth pushing.
Returning to the surface to sucker someone into the job and to
change into some more water durable boots, Lor quickly volunteered
and popped down the hole, followed by Doug. Being 85 degrees
outside, I could hardly withstand the scream which I knew was to
follow. Finally, from amidst a cloud of steam which rose from
the entrance, a purple, shivering lipped Lor made his way out and
uttered "IT GOES".
With these lines and a trip back down to the jeep to re-
trieve some fishnet underwear and boots, Herb, Doug and I des-
cended into what is now dubbed Roaring Spring Cave, With a series
of deep breaths, we closed our minds to all rational thought and
plunged into the flooded passage. There were about three to four
inches of air space as we made our way, crawling like deranged
crayfish through a forest of formations, but before long, a flash
of ecstacy greeted us as the cave opened into walking passage,
Formations hung everywhere and the stream roared ahead of us. We
made our way for about 300 feet to a thundering water shoot.
Above this lay tighter passage blocked partially by loose break-
down. The wind and noise were tremendous. Being very wet and
cold, and not really equipped for such passage, we returned, leav-
ing several high leads unchecked. We plan to return during drier
weather and perhaps with wet suits. There was one other cave
reported on this property by Mr. Francis. We will also check this
out.
The presence of this spring and cave poses several questions,
First of all, it appears to be the only major resurgence of its
kind on this section of Big Walker. Could it be possible that :
this is the resurgence of Salamander and/or Miller's? No large
