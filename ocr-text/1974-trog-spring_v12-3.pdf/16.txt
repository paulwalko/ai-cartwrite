THE SINKING CREEK PROJECT:
by joe saunders
Sinking Creek Valley is a limestone and dolomite floored
valley in southwestern Virginia, stretching thirty miles from
its base on the New River in western Giles County, east, to its
head in central Craig County. The valley is generally two to
three miles wide with Ordovician limestones and dolomites and
upper Cambrian dolomites outcropping along its length. The
drainage of Sinking Creek is actually composed of two valley units;
a downstream, Western section and an upstream, eastern section.
These two are joined where Sinking Creek flows through the gap
between Spruce Run Mountain and Clover Hollow Mountain. Each
of these valley units is headed by anticlinal structures which
plunge to the east.
Many of the larger caves known in the Blacksburg area are
located in the valley of Sinking Creek. Pig Hole is located several
miles from the base of the Creek. Tawney's Cave, about half a
mile long and Smoke Hole, one half to one mile long (survey in
progress) are located at the foot of Clover Hollow and feed water
into Sinking Creek. Four miles to the northeast is clover Hollow
Cave, over two miles long and located on the plunging anticline
at the head of the hollow. Far to the east in the valley lie
Newcastle Murder Hole (8,000 ft.+) and Rufe Caldwell Cave. (3,000ft.+)
Little has been done in the past to relate the caves of the
valley to one another, or to investigate the hydrology of the
valley. I am in the process of trying to piece together a history
of the work done in the valley, by writing to former Tech Cave
Club members and to John Holsinger and Phil Lucas of the Virginia
Cave Survey. At this point, however, I doubt if I am aware of
all the work done in this area. For instance, Earl Thierry hasn't
been contacted yet.
The study of the caves and karst hydrology of the valley can
be divided into five parts. The status and prospects for each are
discussed below.
I. THE SINKING AND REAPPEARANCE OF SINKING CREEK ;
In low water Sinking Creek is said to "sink" completely at a
location about two miles from the New River. Greg Marland, a Tech
caver from the early sixties, reports walking along the creek near
the "sink" area. He concluded that the stream sank into its own
gravel and flowed under the high water stream bed to the New River.
In high water a continuous stream flows to the river. Apparently
no dye tracing has been done. Where the sinking water reappears
is still unknown.
II. SUBTERRANEAN CREEK MEANDER CUTOFFS:
Link's Cave is located high in a hill in a meander of Sinking
Creek. The main part of the cave stretches 300 feet along the strike,
