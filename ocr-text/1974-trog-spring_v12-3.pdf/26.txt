NOTES ON BIG WALKER:

March 30, 1947,
"Bennet, Griffin and I (Bob Barnes)... went over to Poplar
Hill, which is about two miles off route from Pearisburg, between
Pearisburg and Dublin. A.man by the name of J.C. Carr had
written us about a big spring (Carr's #1) he had on his place.
We found him with no trouble and took a look at it. It was a big
one all right, but offered no method of entrance. I walked back
up the mountain and found where a good sized stream went under-
ground. We tried to get under here, but it was too wet for this
time of year, but it looked as though one could get down when the
water went...
Mr. Carr told us of (another) cave up the hill that he
didn't know much about. We found this after consideralbe hiking.
It was a small hole which was about fifteen feet deep and eight
feet.. in diameter, which in itself didn't go anywhere, but there
was a narrow crack over at one side which I could not see down no
matter how much I tried. A rock thrown down this hole brought
back memories of Clover Hollow. Griffin, Bennet aad. I plan to
go back with a small charge and build a cave of caves..."
In July of 1948 Bob Barnes did, indeed, return to this
seemingly insignificant hole in the side of Big Walker Mountain.
With him also came left over dynamite from â€žthe blasting of Pig
Hole's rear entrance. In a series of two blasts and a total
of sixteen sticks of dynamite, Barnes succeeded in opening his
"cave of caves" i.e.- Millers Cave. This was only the first
of several long, challenging caves to appear on Big Walker...
This article concerns Big Walker Mountain, that mist
enshrouded ridge which has delivered us such beauties as
Newberry's, Bane's, Bane's Spring, Buddy Penley's, Salamander,
and Miller's caves. Although much work has been done on this
mountain, it is my belief that Walker is still holding back
on some of its prime secrets. Because of steep slopes and
intermittent wooded areas, it is obvious why exploration has
neither been intense nor comprehensive. Work thus far has been
lightly scattered over a period of about twenty-five years. It
has been dissociated, taking into account only small locales on
the ridge and leaving many areas untouched. Most of the work
has been on random weekend ventures with little focus in mind,
usually unrecorded and soon forgotten.
