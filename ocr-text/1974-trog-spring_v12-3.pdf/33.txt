Following the stormy and vicious in-fighting of the elections,
Rolf McQueary, Cheryl Jones and I went to Clover Hollow, ostensibly
to replace the soggy register which had long since been removed.
Although a mere trickle of water plunged into the entrance drop,
we found that one never knows what surpriset lurk in the shadows
for unsuspecting cavers.
Descending for the first time ever on a length of genuine
Doug Yeatts cable ladder rigged at the 17 foot flowstone, I dis-
covered a pool at the bottom. Fortuna tely, it was a 13 foot ladder.
Almost all hope was lost for the carabiner which Rolf had just
dropped while rigging the ladder, but to our mild surprise, it
had landed on a dry part of the cave floor. Proceeding to the
twelve foot climb, we emerged with wet butts.
Having completed our mission at the bottom of the Canyon Room,
we pushed on to the Andrew's Room. Peering down into the murky
depths, we regretted not having more time. Moving right along,
we checked out the Dragon's Tail and other points of interest.
Cheryl found a cache of old Pepsi bottles and, quite fittingly,
a Clover brand milk bottle. One doesn't see milk bottles much
any more, perhaps they are all buried deep in caves. Anyway,
Cheryl said some thing about "needing jugs and apportioning the
bottles among us, we repaired to the Canyon Room -- prussikede
climbed and squeezed our way out of the cave.
Having emerged from the entrance drop, we assessed the damage :
one lost steel locking "D", one lost pair of gloves, one broken
finger for Rolf, and one twisted shoulder for Cheryl. But look
what we had gained: Three Pepsi bottles, one milk bottle, the
first combat-situation test of the club's new cable ladder, and
a warm fuzzy feeling inside from having replaced the sorely needed
register, Cheryl, having twisted her shoulder, maintained her
reputation as the Evil Knievel of caving. We got out about
7:30 p.m., giving Cheryl plenty of time to make her 7:00 p.m.
meeting.
