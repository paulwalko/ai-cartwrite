The fauna of the world are adapted to many different environ-.
ments. The environment of the cave harbors a large host of creatures
that are adapted to it. One such creature is Hadenoecus
subterraneus or cave cricket. Another species of cricket,
Ceu thophilus stygius, is not as adapted to cave life as Hadenoecus.
Hadenoecus has a body about 2 inches long, but it has an
overall length of 6 inches. This measurement if from the tip of
the antennae to the end of the hind legs. The antennae of the
cave cricket are continuously twitching, feeling out food and
obstacles. The appendages are quite elongated in comparison to
the appendages of its outdoor relatives. The cave cricket is
wingless and therefore must depend on these long legs for moving
from place to place. They are specially adapted for clinging
to cave walls and for walking and hopping great distances during
migratory trips outside the cave to look for food. The color of
Hadenoecus is a very pale brown except for its small, almost
non-functional eyes, which are black. Ceuthophilus has very
prominent markings, yellowish brown in color with black bands
across its abdomen, and larger eyes.
After ma ting, the female cave cricket crawls into a mud-
covered crevice and deposits her eggs there one at a time. The
structure used for this purpose, called an ovipositor, is located
at the posterior end of the body. Embryonic development takes
about 6 weeks. When hatched, the nymphs, or young cave crickets,
are usually seen separated from the adults as a means of self-
preservation. The adults will eat the nymphs if they come too
near.
