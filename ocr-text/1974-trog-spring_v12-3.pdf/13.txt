SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1974
...Fortunately, these grottos are not in critical areas,
One group though, has sole access to a cave system which has had
to have a rescue... once before. In a situation like that, we
might have problems, but it's possible that we may be able to call
other groups in the area and find someone to help.
So far, I've publicized (the CRCN number) to all the grottos
(in the region), passed out cards at region functions, as well
as send a supply of the cards to some of the different outfitters
in the area selling caving equipment....Some of the grotto news-
letters have been very helpful and published the number. We
had talked about taking out a small classified ad in the NSS News
for the CRCN number. I think our region News correspondant is
going to take care of that.
I've tried (to distribute the CRCN number) to police stations,
fire departmants and all, but I've had limited success in getting
a list of places to send it... The ideal thing to do would be to
have someone go to each county sheriff's office and talk to them
a bit about the CRCN, an explain exactly what we can do and how we
are set up. As I understand it, the University Police have inser-
ted notices in police journals about CRCN: at least they told me
they would look into this. I don't know whether they've done
anything or not.
.... I wish I knew to what point I could rely on local grottos
to take care of some of this for me. Because rather than writing
a lot of letters which will get thrown away, and won't make a
whole lot of an impression, I think the best thing would be to
have someone go and talk to... the sheriffs involved, and talk to
the landowners of some of the prominent caves around.... and be sure
they're aware of the cave rescue network, and give them a card.
This is something that needs to be done locally, and I would like
to see more local involvement by grottos.
.... In the direction the CRCN is moving now, and as far as
it is set up now, I don't see a real good way to improve it. I
think it works now, I think it is adequate for the use we give
it. Now the alternative would be to go to a system with an en-
tirely different philosophy of cave rescues. In England, which
has a much higher caving population than the U.s, they have well
organized rescue teams. If a rescue is needed, a regular rescue
team is called out. The teams have training sessions,...a lot of
equipment,...(and) first aid practice. They can coordinate and
move as a team and do the entire rescue themselves. This would
be really good, but in the Virginia Region, I think we would
have a problem setting up a system of this sort. It would be
really difficult if a team based in the D.C. area was called down
to Lee County..for example, because they have 8 or 10 hours be-
fore they can get there.... Just in talking around, I have gotten
some bad vibrations about setting up and formalizing CRCN as a
training situation. Its hard enough for me to get people to
volunteer to be on the list, and I think if I required rescuers to
come to training sessions very few people, if any, would show
