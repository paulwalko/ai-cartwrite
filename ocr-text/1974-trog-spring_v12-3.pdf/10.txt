THE TECH TROGLODYTE

CAVING ACTIVITY: Rolf McQueary, Cheryl Jones, Tom Calhoun, Bob
Alderson and Margie Lewter visited legendary Miller's Cave. This
was the first grotto trip to the cave in many years, Rolf has
been doing extensive work all over the rest of Big Walker Mt.
Not only has he been continuing to survey Salamander, but at
times ridge walking with Lor Windle, Mik Frame and Doug Olsen,
He has been checking out various holes, and has hit upon a
couple good caves waiting to be fully explored.
On a recent trip to Newberry-Bane's, Mike Wolf, Jerry Redder,
Robyn Loud, Lor Windle, and Carol Godla were sitting in the Vault
Room recarbiding. They had just descended Triple. Wells with
Cheryl Jones, Bob Alderson, and John Lilly, and these three were
supposedly ascending the rope. As the first group continued
filling their lamps, a sound was heard from the passage leading
off to Triple Wells. Suddenly three naked bodies streaked out of
the darkness. Cheryl, Bob and John tore around the Vault Room
with nothing but boots and hardhats on. They went around the reg-
ister and dump, then back out. Unwittingly, they had given the
first group enough time to climb up the Devil's Staircase and
beat them to the intersection with the passage leading to the
entrance. Once there, Lor Windle was able to claim a mushy bag
of jelly beans as reward for arriving first and not having to haul
the rope out the remaining distance,
Joe Saunders and Keith Ortiz are doing something, but we
are not quite sure what it is, with what they call the Tawneys,
Links and Smoke Hole "System". Keith has yet to extrapolate his
brain for us.
Don Davison is still working on Ellison's, Don and Cheryl
Jones have opened up at least a mile of virgin passage at the top
of Fantastic Pit, as well as discovered five new deep drops:
Davison's Drop (596'), Fantastic pit rigged from Assault Ledge:
(586'), Smokey I Pit (500'), 1.0.5.s. #5 (488') and Smokey II Pit
(284'). For detailed information, check the Huntsville Grotto
Newsletter and The Region Record.
ABOVE THE GROUND ACTIVITY: Bill Biggers gave a party in D.C.
back in early April, and Ed Loud, Jim Denton, and Mike Wolf rep-
resented the grotto. On the return trip to Blacksburg, they
decided to take a slight detour and about 11 hours later, rolled
up in Ed's V.W. at Canadian Customs in Niagara Falls asking to be
let into Canada. After much deliberation, the customs officials
decided that they were not migrant workers or undesirable aliens,
and let them into the country for an hour or so to view the falls.
The Spring VAR meeting at Anthony Correctional Center
near White Sulfur Springs, West Virginia, was attended by a large
group of VPI cavers. Tom Calhoun and Tuna Johnson represented
the grotto at the business meeting. Later, D.C. Grotto tapped a
number of kegs of beer. Somewhere along the line someone claimed
that VPI could not finish the kegs. The challenge of course was
soon regretted, but not by VPI, who was still thirsty.
Doug Yeatts and Mike Frieders have finished making the new
cable ladders and they are now in use by Grotto personel.
