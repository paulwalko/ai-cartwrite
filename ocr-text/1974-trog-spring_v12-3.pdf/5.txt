A PIECE
OF PRESIDENT:
Our three events of spring quarter are now history. The
club's sixth annual New River Float Trip was a success on May 24,
with good weather, slow water, and much beer. The only people
who drowned were those who tried to find the bottom of the doobie
pot at the party that followed the trip,
One party leads us back to another me the picnic. Held May 11
at the farm of Steve Kark, Bob Page, and Joe Yates, the picnic
began Saturday afternoon and was finally over Sunday night when
the die-hard drinkers finished the sixth keg. Do I hear seven
for next year?
Now we get to the third happening of spring quarter which
really happened first, but is told last because I'm still feel-
ing the effects of looking for the bottom of some damn pot. The
happening was, of course, the elections. Tom Calhoun was elected
our Vice President, Mike Wolf gets to fondle the club's money
for a year, and Carol Godla has become our first giggling sec-
retary. Cheryl Jones became Trog editor and must be doing a
fine job, since she has been yelling at me already for not getro
ting this column in by deadline.
I look forward to working with this staff in the coming
year, and facing the challenges that will come up. The fall is
our most important period since we have the highest number of
new people with an interest in the club. It's to these people
we must turn our attention, because they will be the club in
just a few short years.
If you are going to be around this summer, I'll be seeing
you then. If not, I'll see you in the fall.
Peace,
My doug yeatts
