SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1974
Dale and Mike were carrying cameras in addition to their
regular gear. Dale had a small camera pack tucked effeciently
under his arm. Mike looked like he was carrying supplies to the
Israeli Army. I had a couple of notebooks and a mechanical pen-
cil to record photographs.
After a final briefing at Operations, we headed to the en-
trance, our progress recorded by photographers. At the entrance,
I began a log which I kept throughout the entire trip. The log
has enough material in it for a short book, and this article is
a. relatively incomplete story.
At 9:45 a.m., we climbed past the goat skull on the fence
around the entrance. To make a long story short, it took us
twelve hours to get to base camp.
Telephones were notable; there were about twelve or so in
the cave. It was impossible to get away from these and the sey-
eral miles of wire that serviced them. We were required to call
in at check points on the way in, and Base Camp was always calling
in to chat with people about what was or wasn't happening, and
what was supposed to happen. Many scenes of confusion were
centered around the communication centers,
We didn't have to do twelve hours of straight caving, there
were a couple of established rest points on the way in, Relay
Point 1 (RP-1), and. RP-2, RP-1 was designated by a telephone, a
roll of toilet paper, a trowel, and a can of Lysol, RP-2 was
designated by a telephone, a Gene Harrison, a Tom Williams, an-
other P.S.C. member, sleeping equipment and cooking facilities.
We stayed in RP-2 until we were fed, and the camp accumulated
more people than it could handle, Twelve people were in camp
when we decided to leave.
We kept running into people during the entire trip. There
were two supply teams of three people each that we kept meeting
on the way in. Supply Team #2 was in front of us; Bill Bigger's
self-proclaimed mule team acting like a bunch of asses (they
tried to sound like it anyway!). Supply Team #1 was behind us;
they were overburdened and temporarily disappeared, much to the
dismay of operations and RP-2. There were a couple of biolog-
ical teams running around, but they were only in the front por-
tion of the cave, Base Camp had two permanent residents, Stan
Carts and Janet Queissar. There were two exploration teams,
ET-1 and ET-2, and a mapping crew stationed at Base Camp,
A few hours, out of the twelve hour trip in, were spent on
photographic work. This was our part in the expedition, and there
was no lack of objects for photography. The cave provided quite
a few good scenes for Mike and Dale to work on, and P.S.C. pro-
vided about twenty-three. Along the way, we developed some good
techniques for action photographs of climbs and drops. Mike or
Dale would stop action with: "Hold it right there...OK, let me
focus... How about a little lower ... Alright, put your light out
please. On the count of three. One, two (click), three (flash,
click). Thank you."
