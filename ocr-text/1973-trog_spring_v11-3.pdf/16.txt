Twice as many cavers prefer trips to well-known caves
with friends as those that prefer trips to unknown caves ·
with strangers. Apparently this is due, again, to a feeling
of security when with friends, rather than a feeling of
"knowing". a cave, 12% went as far as to say they would prefer
an unknown cave, but only with friends.
Again, alnost twice as many prefer horizontal over ver-
tical caves. This preference for horizontal caves seems to
have little to do with fear, for all. but claimed they have
been scared at times while caving. These 4. who have never
been scared were all single males, and 3 cave only about
30 hours/year, This seems to correspond with number of years
caving though, Those cavers who have been caving for more
than 5 years tend to prefer horizontal caves, 32%, however,
have no preference, and in fact seem to enjoy both horizontal
and vertical caves in equal proportions, just as they do work
and fun trips. It seems though that those cavers who have
caved for more than 5 years have made up their minds as to
exactly what kind of cave they do prefer, for only 21% of
those who claimed they enjoyed both vertical and horizontal
were cavers with more than 5 years,
All of this seeins to point out that cavers are well
divided into groups within one large general interest group,
centered around the out-of-doors, The boundaries of these
groups are fuzzy, and tend to overlap in some areas, Gener-
ally, vertical caver's seem to enjoy fun trips; whereas hori-
z ntal cavers enjoy mapping (work) trips, Overall, though,
is a feeling of good will and comradery among cavers, few
leaving the overall, large group for social functions. when
partying time comes, all boundaries of preferences in caves
and caving methods seem to be lost. Yet it is these very
preferences themselves which determine the presence of these
social gatherings.
