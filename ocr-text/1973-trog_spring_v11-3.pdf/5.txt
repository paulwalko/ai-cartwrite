THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1973
TUNA SPEAKS
It's that time of the year again. The float trip, picnic,
and elections have come and gone, there's a new set of officers
and the quarter along with the year is almost over, Now I
have the chance to express my views and hopefully, explain what
we are going to try to do next year. .
There are several things I would like to discuss and the
first concerns the Salamander Cave situation. Everything has
more or less faded in the past. However I want to say some-
thing to clear up the element of mystery concerning the
question of whether or not somebody is condemning somebody else
for unsafe caving.
I, along with three other members, had the opportunity
to talk with some of the group which is currently mapping the
cave. The result was not a damnation of the club or the way
we cave and at the same time there should not be any criticism
levied on our part for their practices. The question centers
around the fact the other group uses a prussik safety and a
separate belay when rappelling and prussiking and we don't.
The reason that we don't is that these methods have proved
impracticable, To put it bluntly, we shouldn't be criticized
because we don't and they shouldn't be criticized because
they do, They are from the old school and have been caving
fifteen or twenty years. They started at the time when
vertical work was being born and they learned safe methods
the hard way. So we can't blame them for engaging in ultra-
safe caving practices. We've taken what they and other cavers
have passed on to us, developed them, and adapted them to our
needs. However this is not to say that we are unsafe, its
quite the contrary. Its merely the difference of views. So
much for that.
The other thing I want to discuss is the future, i.e.,
new membership. This is not just an isolated problem but can
be tied in with other such topics as rebel caving and conser-
vation,
As you know, the NSS recently adopted the policy of not
attracting new cavers, in other words not going out and just
grabbing new people, but trying to get free-lance cavers to
join up. This is a good idea for if we don't watch it, caving
will soon (very soon) become exploited and we'll all be in "
the same overcrowded situation such as the hikers, rock climb-
ers and campers. However we, as a student grotto, experience
a large turnover. The fact is that we must, in order to re-
place the people that leave each year, get in new people,
The question is how do we attract them, At the meeting
of officers and committee chairmen I called recently, some
very good ideas were brought forth and tossed around. The
ideas ranged from simple flyers to posters and then some.
Final decisions along these lines are up to the vice-president
