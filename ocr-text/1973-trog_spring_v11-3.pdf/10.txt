One of the oft neglected skills that one develops
through years of caving is that of coping with gastronomic
rumbles while partaking of the rigors of the underground,
Savoir-faire in this department is like that in conning
neophytes down absurd holes searching for "fantastec for-
mations", extracting newsletter material from unwilling
contributors, and convincing skeptical landowners of your
professional credentials' while at the same time disguising
your sex from his 18th century mores, lethods of firing
up a carbide lanp and prussiking a drop are fairly stand-
ardized, while feeding your face satisfactorily on a long
trip is individually acquired, usually by trial and error,
As the novice racks up hours underground, he learns
that most candy bars end up in a disgusting chocolate mess,
baloney sandwichs become a muddy baloney glob, Space-food
sticks are close to nauseating, and comrades don't appreciate
beer nuts without beer to go with them. A good cave food
should meet the following requirements:
1) It should provide quick energy, ici, have lotsa calories.
2) Should be compactly carried and able to take mashing,
scrunching, etc,
Something that needs the minimum of handling of muddy
hands.
4) It should not be too salty, unless you plan on taking
alot of drinking water along too,
It should have the least amount of packaging, since
whatever goes in must come out,
6) It should taste good and not be too disgusting to the
other on the trip.
with that in mind, aren't you a little tired of the same
old garbage? Enbrace the spirit of adventure and try some
of the following:
PEACH LEATHER (fron granna's old timey cook book)
Peel soft ripe peaches. ash and remove juice. To every
cup of peaches, add Ã¤ cup sugar. Let simmer 15 minutes,
Pour into shallow pan and cool, Set pan into oven at 200
degrees and dry until "tough as leather". Cut in thin
squares or roll and slice, Sprinkle with powdered sugar
and store,
Are you addicted to dried pineapple sold at Appala-
cian Outfitters and can't bear to pay the price? Try
sun-drying (or in a slow oven) fresh or canned pineapple
chunks then roll in confectioner's sugar, An unusual
snack and good as a pass-around,
