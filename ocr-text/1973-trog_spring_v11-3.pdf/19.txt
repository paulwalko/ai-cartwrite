THE TECH TROGLODYTE

1973
Recently I had the unique and fortunate experience to do
soinething other than just leading a trip. I presented an hour
and a half long demonstration and slide lecture to an elementary
school. Basically I was doing something I enjoy doing, talking
about caving. However the opportunity for selling conservation
to kids who will undoubtably be visiting local.caves was unique.
Being a photographer of sorts I have a large inventory of caving
slides including a sequence relating to cave vandalism. This
sequence provided the basis to my low key selling of conservation.
It is unbelievable how receptive elementary school children,
They were literally hanging on each slide of people caving
and formations. When the first slide of broken formations came
along the entire school just went silent. Without my having to
say a word they had already got ny message. The remainder of
the sequence of broken formations, writing on walls, and general
trash merely served as reinforcement of the idea of conservation,
Surely the children could not understand the concept of
conservation but they knew what the results breaking formations
and writing on walls would be. In fact during the question
period afterwards, the majority of questions were related to
conservation and whether I practiced what I preached,
Following the program I felt I had really accomplished some-
thing for conservation. But, I also realized how little of this
type of thing was done, Once again the request had come to the
club. It is in this area that I believe conservation should move.
We should actively make ourselves available to local schools
and groups for just such presentations. Most schools have yearly
programs of speakers that are invited to speak to the schools,
They are constantly looking for people to speak on different
topics. I daresay they would jump at the chance to get a
caver to speak. It has that air of excitment and danger that
automatically insures audience interest. It is this almost
captive interest that provides the opportunity to deliver a
conservation message,
I feel that it is the grotto's responsibility to volunteer
for community speaking. We should not have to wait to be asked,
And, laughing at such a request only goes to show just how
weak conservation really is.
