THE TECH TROGLODYTE
"enjoys" cleaning dog shit! well, however you get your
kicks.
If the cave club met only once a month, more than 75%
felt they would go caving the same amount as they do now.
23% felt they would cave less than they do now. If the cave
club had no parties after their meetings, the same 75% felt
they would still cave the same amonnt. However, about 10%
said they would then probably cave more than they do now
if there were no parties after meetings,
When asked if they prefer to party with the same people
they cave with, the vast majority said yes, because of the
greater trust and closer friendships. Some, however, claimed
they would not necessarily cave with all of those that they
party with, because many "partyers" are not "cavers", but
they would party gladly with those they cave with. Generally
the feeling was summed up logically with "I like caving with
people I like".
About 40% of those surveyed. prefer work trips over fun
trips, Only 18% prefer fun trips over work trips. The re-
maining group claimed no preferences at all, generally with
a desire for a 50-50 split in work-fun trips, Interesting
to note was that there were absolutely no differences in
preference between older cavers (those who have caved for
more than 43 years) and younger cavers (those who have caved
for less than 43 years). That is, of those claiming prefer-
ences of work or fun trips, of those who have caved for less
than 43 years, 30% preferred fun, while 70% preferred work;
of those who have caved for inore than 43 years, again, 30%
preferred fun, while 70% preferred work. Also, those who
preferred work and fun trips in even proportions were distri-
buted evenly over the age groups. So, it seeins that years
of caving experience plays little or no part in what type
of caving you prefer, There was also no difference in pref-
erence from males to females. The very great majority
claimed they would, indeed, enjoy a fun trip with the same
people they go with on work trips, and vice versa.
Only 36% of those cavers, interviewed were involved in
their own special caving projects at the time of this survey.
(iiddle winter quarter, 1973) of those reinaining without
any pro octs, about 30% are looking for a project of some sort
to work on. So it appears that a little less than half those
surveyed either don't care or don't have the time for mapping,
conservation, cave-finding, etc,
Cavers seem to be evenly divided when it comes to
"learning" a cave, Half would rather get to know one cave
very well, as opposed to knowing many caves superficially.
Perhaps this correlates with whether or not the caver pre-
fers mapping (work trips), and so knowing one cave very well.
