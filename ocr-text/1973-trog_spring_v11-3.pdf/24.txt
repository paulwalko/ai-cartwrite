SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
TRIP REPORT FÖRSGROTTO Dia
-Don DAVISON JR.
Back when nen were men and Paul Broughton still lurked
beneath the ground in Virginia, a trip report was written but
not published. For it was the story of an unsafe trip and
the editor of this publication felt its release would stain
the image of caving at VPI. Now the story may be told. This
is the trip report of the unsafe trip, Read and weep. .
The map of Gray's Cave (Lebanon quadrangle, Russell Co.,
Va.) has remained unfinished for almost 3 years. When the
water was low, one caver claimed to have seen passage at the
far end of the second lake. The means of crossing the lake
were not available at the time. The water rose and the rumor
of the drowned passage grew. Cavers would float out onto the
lake on air mattresses to plumb and speculate, on April 11,
1970, Don Davison (D), Jim. Talmadge (T), Paul Broughton (PB),
and Steve Hall (R) of the VPI Grotto NSS set out to solve the
riddle, D, and experienced diver, would attempt to press
the mysterious passage,
We arrived at the cave about 11:00 AM and proceeded to
climb into our caving gear, . T was descending into the
entrance sink when a very incensed landowner arrived on the
scene, (Mr. - Buddy Gray, Route 1, Lebanon, Va, lives in the
house with the white fence around it, on the right going down-
hill from the cave entrance.). Prior groups had not contacted
the landowner and we had assumed the cave was on public land.
After some discussion, with PB playing the leading role, as
STAR REDNECK, We were given permission to explore, On exiting
the cave a more congenial landowner greeted us. The cave was
entered at 11:30 with H hauling a duffel bag containing wet
suit, light, regulator, etc.; T carrying the 71.2 cubic foot
tank on his back; and PB carrying the weight belt. and 60 feet
of Goldline. The diver remained unburdened to conserve energy.
After proceeding about 300 feet through heavily vandal-
ized walking passage (sledge hamners had obviously been at :
work) a crawl was encountered. The Goldline was attached to
the duffel bag and fed to DC as he pushed the crawl. At the
end of the passage was a small hole about 13 feet in diameter.
The duffel was dragged to this point and with D2 pulling and
H pushing from the rear it was cleared through. The tank was
dragged through the crawl, valve first, the bottom of the
tank was the only part in contact with the rocks, glass, and
cans forming the floor,
Next came à stoop walk leading to walking passage, a
short climb, and a tight crawl. This crawl was a horizontal
slit, In the center was a pool of water and an 8 inch clear-
ance forming the only body-sized passage. We nearly drowned
but cleared the equipment after some effort. On returning
the last man through had a dry crawl; seven sets of clothing
had absorbed all available moisture,

achieved. It is fed by a shallow rushing stream at the dry
