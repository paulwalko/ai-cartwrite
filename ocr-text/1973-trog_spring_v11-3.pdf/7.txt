THE GROTTO GRAPEVINE
LBY DENNIS WEBB
. CAVER ENTSUS IA:SM.. In thinking of the sport of caving
(and of ways to increase the club treasury), members of the
club have discussed the possibility of selling non-achieve-
ment patches to individuals who meet the requirements, and
to organizations that may be willing to purchase large num-
bers of patches, such as the D.C. Grotto, The "Lazy Eight"
patch can be made.available to those who successfully make
it through eight Virginia commercial cave tours with the
least amount of effort and self-achievement, as approved by
the Association of Armchair Cavers. The "Virginia Horizon-
tal ten" patch can be for those brave souls who survive the
rigours of ten Virginia horizontal - walking passage - cavers,
accomplished with a minimum of enjoyinent while taking the
longest possible time in each cave, as approved by the Com-
mittee for the Promotion of festriction and Negative Atti-
tudes. This committee will establish a minimum of twelve
rules that all participants in the Sorizontal Ten program
must agree to follow by signing a pledge; the committee
will hopefully be staffed by members of the Simmons-lingo
Project Committee.
CLUB BUSINESS... It has been generally agreed among
our present pembers that past (as well as present) members.

Spring Picnic at Trout Creek Shelter was a huge success,
Don Davison's car carne to a scrunching halt when the car's
bottom struck aground as Don fried to cross the ford. Bill
Douty fell off the shelter roof and broke his arm, Polly
Wick caught her Bruce Byrd-borrowed jeans afire and burn-
ed a spot on her leg. And there were many other surprises,
