BY DON DAVISON JR.
The inspiration for this song is A.I. Cartwright, the
V.P.I. Grotto nasot, who appears on our patch, various prin-
ciples, lore, and experiences of the grotto for:n the basis
for much of the lyrics.
Standin' on the nountain, lookin' all around,
when this thing cones at me a movin' like a hound.
All at once it disappears, no more to be seen,
must be 2 Trorlodyte, he's going subterrean,
on they're big and hairy, though shall ones oft
are found,
they like it fine just to diell beneath the ground,
where it's dann and nuddy, and darker than the nicht,
Places that give normal folks always quite a fright.
UN
Pack on his back, or on his hip or rear.
Carbiners rattlin', that ain't half his year,
Baby bottles full, full of what you ask,
ES Carbide and water to make the burnin' gas.
Light on his head and rope across his chest.
Patch on his ar of the family he likes best.
Centeen on his hip. On hear the brake bar ring.
And in the still of a late spring night you can al-
ways hear the sing.
Sone co horizontal, and others hang on rope,
up and down and up and down like records that are
broke.
Jammin bodies into cracks, where lizards cannot go.
Comin' out a soakin' wet at five degrees below.
Crawlin' and a wallowin' in dusty bat quano,
onderin' if histoplasmosis' gonna show,
Fightin' off the rabid bats and rats with teeth that
gleari,
It ain't no wonder he often gets obscene.
Once an old Tromlodyte, he thought that he could drive.
Oh, Mell he totalled it, but managed to survive,
MOU i≈ø one tries people head for the hills.
Cause if a Datsun don't get you then a Volkswagen will.
Their feet are nade of Vibram lugs, when drunk they
are serene.
They love the cave fornations and try to keep then
clean,
But if you see one walkin' ridge or enterin' the cave,
keep your distance far away and your soul you will save,
