About 60% of those surveyed: first attended a caving
oriented organization meeting due to mainly a curiosity sin-
ply about caving, .A very few admitted a curiosity about cav-
ers, or an interest in science, or that they came first with
friends, one even admitted that he attended a meeting be-
cause he liked to party! . Of particular interest were the
20% who came to a meeting because they were already private
cavers, : It makes you wonder just how many private cavers
there are, and points out the importance of making those
people aware of the beneficial aspects of being a part of a
group.
: After their first caving trip, about 50% of those sur-
veyed waited one week to go caving again. This is predict-
able and based upon the set up of a school-oriented organi-
zation. Only 10% went caving the very next day, and 40%
waited one whole month or longer. A surprising outcome
here was that those males, now still single, generally tended
to wait longer than one month before their second trip, and
in most cases, waited two months or more. So, if you want
to get married, don't waiti (To go caving that is!):
52% of those surveyed felt that the most desireable:
aspect of being in the cave club when they first joined was
simply the caving itself, 36% felt it was the fellowship in-
volved. A few favored the sense of accomplishment attained,
one just needed a car to get to the caves, and one enjoyed
singing "Charlotte" and watching lewd people, of interest
here is that of those original" 52% who at first desired the
caving over the fellowship, now only 23% put caving first.
The vast majority, after a period of "establishing" thein-
selves in the club as cavers, felt that fellowship was much
more important than the actual caving.
'I'm not sure what it says about people, but about 70%
surveyed call themselves "cavers";" while only 9% call thein-
selves "speleologists", 18% figured they were both, and one
person went as far as to reject both and proclaim herself a
"Woman"!
Only two, both single females, of the.44 surveyed, felt
they would not continue to be "caving oriented" for many
years to come, Looks like once you're in, you're hooked.
Activities and interests outside of caving were nany and
varied, 45%, predictably; claimed camping and hiking activi-
ties as high in their interests, 167c clained photography,
and about 970 are rock climbers. Only 13% of the cave club
are drinkers, Anybody would swear there are more than that
after attending a Friday night seminar! :9%, all females,
are animal lovers, especially of horses. Only 2 cavers
listed sex in their activities (only 2?) and 2 listed sleep-
ing. Other interestes ranged from hitchhiking, to Scuba
diving, to conputers, to beercans, One even claimed he
