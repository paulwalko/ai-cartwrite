YOUR PROBLEM
IS OBVIOUS2000
BY ED RICHARDSON
Picture yourself in a room. A room the size of a small
auditorium. A small auditorium with seats, stage, black-
board, and a movie screen. There seems to be nothing un-
usual about this typically small auditorium. However, once
a week a very drastic change occurs. A change as hideous
as that of a werewolf at full moon begins every Friday even-
ing at approximately 6:45 and is completed by 7:00. Let's
go to this room. The time: 6:45; the place: Aggie Aud-
itorium; Virgin Tech, Bleaksburg.
All is quiet and peaceful. Then something begins to
happen, . All of a sudden you are hit by the deadness and
coldness of the place, like that of a mausoleum, the calm
before the storm. Then the storm strikes!
on, my God! I must be at Daytona! With the roaring
of engines, screaching of tires, and blaring of horns, THEY
begin to arrive, Wearing jeans, denim jackets, and boots,
Smelling faintly of musty dirt, of alcohol and the devil,
killer weed, they enter, Some stagger in laughing and gig-
gling; others enter very dignified, straight and serious,
You know these people. It's the Cave Club! Horrid!
Go ahead, mingle, Let's listen to some conversation..
Over there is a group of "ladies"..
P.W. "I hear it's been so long since Frame has been
to bed with a girl, he has regained his virginity,"
C.D.: "Really! I didn't know you could do that,
R.0.; "I castrated a Pete....I mean a sheep with my
teeth today."
T.F.: "Oh, look at me everybody! I'm so great! I'm
too smart for my own good. I even beat Tuna on a geology
test. I graduated number one out of 18,923,692 other idiots.
I can even recite the Declaration of Independence; "Four
score and seven years ago,.."
Suddenly the room gets very quiet, You look around to
see everyone on their knees. What are they bowing to?
Then HE comes in. No!. Holy bat shit, it can't be! A 200
pound Tuna fish!!? Wearing a crown? What is he doing with
that Victorola horn in his ear? Surely this can't be right.
Why would anybody elect this power hungary maniac to such
an important position of honor and prestige?' I bet they'd
even elect a female vice-president. He is followed by his
loyal followers. All three of them.
T.J.: "Bain, Bam, Bam,"
"I'd like to call the meeting to order. Kathy Andrandy-
are you sure you're not Siamese twins-read the minutes from
the last meeting."
