A LOK AT THE

THE RESULTS OF A SURVEY BY
KAREN YEATTS
In the Spring 1971 issue of The Troglodyte there was a
survey of the interesting "little things a VPI caver contends
with while underground", and included with these baby bottle
and coveralls statistics were the years of experience as a
caver. This survey dealt most with the materialistic prob-
lems and solutions of cavers.
The survey statistics and elementary theorizing follow-
ing is not an attempt to copy any previous surveys, but rath-
er it was born from a desire to know "why do you go caving?"
It has appeared obvious to me that the group of persons call-
ing themselves cavers is a unique part of the overall human
family, showing certain characteristics and behavior patterns
not seen elsewhere. (I do feel however, that there are cer-
tain parallels to this group found in other groups throughout
society.) I have not attempted to deal in any way with those
behavior patterns which separate cavers from noncavers, but
rather have attempted to gain some insight into the personal-
ities of the different cavers within one particular group;
that is the characteristics which make one caver unique from
another, or which may even categorize certain cavers into
defineable groups. Now granted, no person wishes to be cate-
gorized. We all desire to think of ourselves as unique, but
there do appear to be separate and specific integrated groups
of emotional trends and behavior tendencies found within the
caving-oriented circle,
This study, far from as extensive or professional as it
should be, has been one lowly Bio major - Psych minor student's
attempt at classifying cavers specifically related to the VPI
Grotto and determining some insight into their reasons for
the desire to populate the underground, It must be recognized
that statistics given may or may not correspond in a larger
caving circle, say, the Va, Region or the NSS.
To begin with a few simple statistics; of the 54 surveys
distributed, 44 were given back, filled in. Of these 44, 90%
are in the Cave Club now, and 10% once were but are not now,
There were 32 males and 11 females involved, and one unde-
cided, (who I think was Tuna). Only 28% of the males were
