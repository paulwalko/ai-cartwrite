All the effort had paid off he thought and noted a high lead,
in the ceiling of the second room; The first room was 50-60
feet long with a 25.foot high ceiling. It was about 25
feet wide, The branch was 30-35 feet long and 25 feet wide
with a 20 foot ceiling.. The rooms were steep müd slope:

After several more dives to check the rooms for further
passage, the diver reentered the silted slit and finally
emerged into the lake. Da desuited and told the team of
their victory. During the process of changing the diver
caught cold. (occupational hazard #351.2 b).
