married, but about 45% of the females were married. So,
of all the cavers are females and 32% of the cavers are :
married,
Ages of cavers in this student grotto ranged from the
predictable 18 with Å½ year of caving to one 33 year old with
18 years of caving, (Guess who!) Disregarding the 30, 31, and
33 year olds that filled out the survey, average age in this
grotto seems to be about 223 with 43 years of caving. There
were no married men younger than 22, and no single wonen older
than 23. (Sweet young things?!:) But, all of this seems so
predictable for a student grotto, So Ill get into some more
interesting (I hope) statistics.
One married male caver says he puts in 400 hours/year
underground. The next most active cavers after that put in
about 250, and they're single! And so I wonder where the
married guy finds the time i An average seems to be around
125 hours/year spent underground, feck, that's only 1.4% of
a year or .02 je of your life!
Surprisingly for a geology oriented group, only 20% sur-
veyed majored in or had their field of work in geology, Sur-
prising also were the 1646 in engineering. Other fields and
majors ranged from forestry, to computer science, to biology,
to aerospace engineering. You name the field and there seemned
to be at least one person in it - emen down to another
"undecided"!
64% of the cavers surveyed originally heard about caving
from an acquaintance, 27% either read about caving or saw it
advertised in posters, and only about 9% thought up the idea
of going caving all by themselves. If this last is any indi-
cation of originality, then it seems that only the married
males are original, in that sense.
. About 82% were immediately excited at the concept of
going underground, and it seems that 86% were really "turned
on" to caving with the first cave they entered. Of those
renaining 14% who were not immediately turned on, it seems
that the major reason was that their first caves were much
beyond their means and capabilities. This is an understand-
able, and I feel, important aspect to consider in taking
trainees caving. We must consider their capabilities,
Naturally, this survey says nothing about those people who
went caving one time and then never came back. Were they
just downright scared by their first cave? And if they were,
could they have been brought into caving a little more
"gently"? Or, is it inportant to "weed" out the weaker
cavers first? I think not, and that careful consideration
must be used in picking your first caves for trainee-trips.
