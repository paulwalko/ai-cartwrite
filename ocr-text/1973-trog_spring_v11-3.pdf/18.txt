was drifted into ear shot or seen old Troggy wave,
And then a spell took over as in the cave they wound.
And ever ever after his sole durelled beneath the ground.

CONSERVATION
BEGINS AT HOME WA

Currently there is a great cry from organized' cavers
concerning cave conservation; cavers are undergoing increased
vandalism, cave gates are being torn off and caves are in-
creasingly being closedWhat can be done about the problem?
Most, probably all, grottos have standing conservation
committees, and that is exactly what they do, stand, I do
not mean to imply that they do nothing. . However, all of
their activities are grotto related. For example; the
grotto sponsers a trip to clean up a cave, or to gate an en-
trance, etc. These are all selfish interests. The cave is
cleaned up so that organized cavers do not have to look at
trash. The cave is gated to let only organized cavers enter.
As you can see this leaves out a rather large portion of peo-
ple, the non-NSS cavers, . Which contains many more cavers than
does the NSS.
What can we as conservation oriented cavers do to help
ourselves? The answer is quite obvious. We must bring our
conservation ethic to the mass of cavers. This will require
a larger amount of effort than many cavers are willing to ex-
pend. In caving areas this will require involvment with the
cominunity. On a large and continuing scale,
In my years here in Blacksburg I have seen the President,
and Secretary read many letters from local and distant groups
visiting Blacksburg who would like programs presented or com-
petent leaders to take trips caving. vost have immediatly
gotten a long round of laughter and then eventually found to
do the task, If possible I try to volunteer first because
I enjoy introducing people to caving and more important these
are excellent opportunities to stress cave conservation.
