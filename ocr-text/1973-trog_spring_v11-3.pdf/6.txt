and publicity chairman. However, looking at the past, I feel
that no matter how we do it, we will get more than enough
new prospects,
Now the question becomes how do we separate those who
are interested and weed out those who come just for the social
life, to find locations, or have no real interest but just
hang on,
One way is to take them caving. But not to an easy cave.
Take them to a relatively hard cave. Don't kill them but make
them realize that caving isn't all easy and can be dangerous,
Then hopefully, if they are not interested, they won't
go caving on their own or just hang around. I'm not saying
that this is the only way. I'm just saying that this is a
possibility.
Now, how do we retain those who are definitely interested,
This is going to require the cooperation of the club. Plans
for such things as the training sessions, in both mapping
and vertical work, and programs are under way. As for the
training sessions, they are going to require the help of the
people whose major fields or interests lie within the realm
of mapping, vertical techniques and associated subjects,
Do you have a particular area that you think you can help in
or are interested in? Tell Cheryl, AS vice president she
is responsible for organization and she'll be glad to lis-
ten to ideas and if possible incorporate them. Another area
is the programs, We are planning on having programs every
Friday night ranging from general slide shows on caving
and talks by various people on specific caves to specialized
subjects and techniques. Do you have an idea for a good
program? Let Cheryl, Bruce (program chairman) or myself know,
Also if you want to give a program let us know. If you have
any suggestions, ideas, or criticisms, by all means bring
them up.
Also there are plenty of ways for you to get involved
and help the club. Various committee chairmen need help,
There's THE TROGLODYTE. Kark(our faithful die-hard editor)
always needs people to work with him.
I have all the faith in the world in the rest of the
officers and committee chairmen, : It's a good nucleus and
I'm sure they'll do a good job. We've got a good club with
lots of potential and there's no reason we can't becoine co-
ordinated, help the new people, and at the same time do some
constructive caving and have a good time too; Believe me
its fun working with new people and a lot of satisfaction can
be obtained when you see them developing into productive
cavers,
In closing, I merely want to say--- Good luck on exams,
have a nice summer, and see you next fall,
