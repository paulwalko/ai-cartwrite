end of the 70x30' room. The ceiling was about 8' high where
we stood. As one looked down the lake the walls closed in
and the ceiling dropped. The lake was bordered by sheer rock
on three sides with a sinall beach and stream on the other,
The room looked like a funnel which has been placed on its
side in a full dish of water,
D2 suited up with assistance from the support team.
Clothing was hung from the chert nodules and the passage
dubbed "Ye Olde Wardrobe;" The diver entered the water tied
to shore with 125' of heavy duty avalanche cord. Twas on the
control line, Diving equipment included å" wet suit, under-
water light, depth guage, knife, mask, snorkel, control line,
weight belt, tank with J valve, single-hose regulator, and
fins, A system of pull signals had previously been
established,
After clearing the air from his suit, Da proceeded along
the bottom towards the drowned passage at a constant depth of
about 6 feet, Visibility was 3-4 feet, Upon finding the
left wall he turned and proceeded down towards the presumative
passage. The depth increased until a small 4! high wall was
encountered at a depth of 16 feet, The wall contained a foot
wide: hole but further progress was not possible. No current
was detected but a steep mud' slope began immediately on the
far side of the hole, Exhaled air struck the chert nodules
overhead and resounded as if hammers were beating on a metal
drum. The sound was loud and reverberating. The diver re-
turned and discussed the situation with a disappointed support
team.
The right wall was explorei', starting from the beach,
until the small hole was again encountered. Thus the only
passage was impassable to a diver. During the exploration of
the right wall a white crayfish with transparent telson was
observed, White cave isopods were very common on the under-
side of rocks and brown conspiral snails were frequently en-
countered.
The least likely place to find passage was in the left
wall, along which the stream ran. Of all the walls it was
the most vertical and the least marked. But we'd come this
far, D2 proceeded to follow the left wall from the entrance
of the stream. As he moved along he saw a slight rise in the
coarse gravel fluor. On the other side was a slope which
lead down to a slit 6-8' wide and 2' high, at a depth of 6'.
D2 returned to the support location and thawed out. The
water temperature was probably about 50° F but movement had
to be fairly slow in the poor visibility and thus the fins
were used very little,
After warning slightly, the slit was entered. The air
bubbles were hammering again and visibility was 2-3 feet.
The only color was orange-brown. In between exhalations
there was only eerie silence, Da followed the ceiling with
his hand. After proceeding slowly there was a tug on the line,
The line was stuck. D2 slowly retraced his path and found the
problem. He then left the slit to tell the crew that the
passage was continuing. The diver then returned to the slit.
Visibility was about 6" to a foot. About 30 feet into the
