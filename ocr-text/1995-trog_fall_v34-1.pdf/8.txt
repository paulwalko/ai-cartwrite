The first few steps are unsure.
Acquiring cave legs is difficult
after sixty feet of adrenaline flow.
But sureness builds
as we crawl on horizontal rock.
More difficulties and new steps occur.
Unstable rungs and cables to climb.
Twisting and turning with every step
as I find the balance between ripping hands to shreds
and swaying that little bit to find the next rung.
As feet touch ground
they settle into familiar skills.
We find holes and small caverns to maneuver through
while our leaders prepare for Bill's Rappel.
Crawling through tight places is comforting,
A respite from the unknown drop.
However, to experience what the cave
offers those who explore it,
one must face this challenge.
Standing at the top,
grasping for confidence and security,
the calls are relayed again.
And I begin again.
Trembling,
Leaning back into the rope,
seemingly defying gravity for that instant Â·
as I pass over the lip.
A longer, straighter descent.
Bats line the wall-
Eyes on the staring rock face.
From below- the glimmer of a carbide lamp.
So distant.
Nothing but the rock ahead
and the light
One hundred sixty feet below.
Relying only on untamed skill
and the friction between me and
the rope twisting around a figure eight.
I reach bottom and roles are reversed.
Looking up, the rock smiles
with the reflection of the carbide-
one from above and now
mine from below.
