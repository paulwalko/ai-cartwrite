Pain and Pleasure in Windy - Cassells
by Wil Orndorff
Plans for a Simmons-Mingo thru-
trip began to take shape about a month
before the 1995 Old Timers' Reunion.
Ray Sira had done the trip before, a
couple of times a few years earlier.
Due to the complexity of the cave, he
figured we had better hook up with
someone who definitely new the route.
A few weeks and a dozen or so phone
calls later, everything was set, or so we
thought. Ray, Steve Wells, and I
would hook up with two or three
cavers from the Northern New Jersey
Grotto, one of whom knew the route.
Early Friday morning, the group would
enter the Stan's Blowing Hole entrance
just west of US219 near Snowshoe,
WV. After at least twelve hours of
climbing, crawling, traversing, and
losing and refinding the way, we'd
emerge at the Mingo entrance, over
10,000 horizontal and plus 640 vertical
feet away. During a portion of the trip,
we'd be caving with over 1500 feet of
rock over our head. Simmons-Mingo
lies directly beneath Mingo Knob, one
of the highest peaks in West Virginia.
These were our plans. Ah, but the best
laid plans of mice and men (bats and
cavers?, Ray, Steve, and Wil?) ...
Our VPI contingent arrived at
OTR early Thursday, so we could set
up camp and get a good night's sleep
before our great adventure. Searching
the campground, we found that the
New Jersey group was already
underground in another cave.
Ordinarily so far from any respectable
cave, they were getting in as much
caving as possible while in central
West Virginia. When they returned,
we would verify an early departure
time for Simmons-Mingo on Friday.
By 10 p.m., our compatriots from
the toxic north were still in absentia,
and our committee of three decided that
they would probably be too worn out
for the rigors of a Simmons-Mingo thru
trip, especially if we wanted to get
back to OTR by Saturday night.
Instead, we would plan something less
rigorous (more in the spirit of Old
Timers', anyway).
During our evening of only
moderate partying, Ray had mentioned
the planned SM trip to a friend, whose
reply was, more or less - “ Oh, you're
on that trip. Whew! I guess there's at
least a chance of finding the route.”
Because such statements engender little
confidence, we felt even better about
our decision to wimp out and go on a
shorter trip.
The New Jersey crew returned to
the campground after eleven, and
quickly concurred that Simmons-Mingo
was now a bad idea. Instead, we chose
a scaled down version of our earlier
plan. We'd still do a thru-trip, but in
Windy-Cassells, a much shorter and
less impressive cave, at least in a
statistical sense. By doing a cross-over
trip instead of just a one way, we could
bring along a few more VPI cavers and
thereby exhibit greater honor. We
would leave no later than 10 a.m. the
next morning, so we could return in
time for a full Friday evening of
partying.
Friday morning came, and we
finally rolled out of the campground
just before noon and cruised the 45
minute drive to the cave in a three car
caravan. After checking in with the
landowner, we prepared to enter
Windy-Cassells. Reggie Reid, Steve
