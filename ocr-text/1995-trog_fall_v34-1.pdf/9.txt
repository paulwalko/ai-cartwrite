I watch the descent of others
in disbelief.
So slowly it seems-
Barely moving
Gravity is the guide.
I did that.
The caye now presents itself.
Tubes of rock rise
Hundreds of feet high,
meters in diameter.
Large wells dug by
water unseen by man.
Again, cautious comfort
as we travel the
unfamiliar passages.
Natural subway tunnels.
Mud slicks challenge
small ascents
As rock presses against thigh.
Accomplishment in joining those
whose ascent was
less cumbersome.
Then sliding down
quickly- covered with mud
and landing in a small meander.
A slick, complicated retreat
Requires caution.
But spirits rise
with new energy
as we turn to face the
Ascension from the depths.
From the bottom of the rappel-
We joke of prussiking-
a slow and tedious undertaking,
but instead begin the twists,
turns, and
climbs of the
Devil's Staircase.
Pulling with all upper body
is not enough
And only true teamwork supports
one whose hands
barely reach the holds.
