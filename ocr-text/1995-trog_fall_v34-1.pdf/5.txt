About twenty feet from where we
landed was the next drop of 25 feet. It
was not as spectacular, but I got to land in
a mud puddle which made me quite happy.
We wandered around in the rest of the
caye looking for the final 60 foot drop.
When we did find it we were running out
of time. I had a paper to finish writing --
and the Simpsons were on!!! Along the
way we saw many spectacular formations,
including a gigantic white column and a
flow stone room that had many pretty
pools.
Though we had dropped about three
times in the cave we had not traveled a
horizontal distance of more that 1000 feet.
When we arrived at the surface it was still
light outside, though the sun was setting.
We were successful!! Between the three
of us, we found Caldwell, found
pornography, and got muddy!
