Grotto Grapevine
by A.l. Cartwright
Whew! Blacksburg survived
Convention this summer. There were
no rescues from either area caves or
the Christiansburg drunk tank. Many
local shop owners expressed gratitude
for the added business during their slow
season.
Ed Fortney, Security Chief, had his
deputies on the prowl to scare off any
troublemakers, but most of their time
was spent trying to keep the alcohol
hidden. Ed may have some interesting
stories to tell: ask him about our visit
from the Highlander.
As usual, the Photo Salon was a
popular event, though the winning slide
was a bit controversial. Perhaps the
highlight of the evening festivities was
the RamenÂ® wrestling done by Bill
Bussey and whoever else dove it. (But
these are professionals, kids; do not try
this at home.) The event amused both
cavers and local police officers alike.
In addition to Jim Washington,
head leader-guy, there were many who
put in time and effort to make
Convention a success. Philip Balister
and Ed organized the campground,
Sandy Knapp did events planning, and
Walt Pirie led several caving trips. And,
of course, Pam Mohr did her job as
welcome wagon committee/social
butterfly at the campground.
Wil Orndorff led one of the two
Geology Field Trips, both of which had
a large turnout. Several VPI cavers lent
him a hand.
This is only a mention of the many
people involved. Thanks to all who
performed jobs both large and small.
OTR was pleasant and relatively
small this year. Cooler dancing was all
the rage, and Matt Siegler even
managed to make some money from
his performance. Philip B. gave his
impersonation of the dancers at Girls,
Girls, Girls, Roanoke's only topless go-
go bar. Some think his performance put
them to shame
True to his entrepreneurial spirit,
Craig Ferguson and some friends tied
Bob Simonds' camcorder to a weather
balloon to catch the action from above.
They tried to make it to the hot tub
area, but the telephone lines got in the
way of the balloon's leash. I
recommend viewing the video before
eating since they recorded on a very
windy day.
