to make sure that the rest of the group
had a great time, by continuously
bitching about how much things were
sucking, the logic being that relative to
me, everyone was having a great trip!
After a particularly foggy series of
up climbs, Ray let out a whoop of joy.
(Yes, that's right, a whoop. If you
don't believe it, you weren't there.)
We'd found the connection, a thirty-
five foot climb on which a rope would
have been nice. Windy-Cassell's is a
fairly complicated cave, and Ray was a
bit concerned that we might not find
the connection. But we did, and
without any significant backtracking.
The connection climb had two
parts. The lower climb was an off
width chimney opening down the
passage, and was easily negotiated.
The upper portion was more of an
overhung wall climb, with an old etrier
in place for assistance in negotiating
the keyhole at the top. As I negotiated
the upper climb, I turned to hear Ray
say "Smile‚Äù as he snapped my picture,
milliseconds before a cry of help
escaped my lips as my hand began to
slip from the etrier. With a little help
from Steve, Carl, and Reggie, I quickly
recovered and completed the climb.
Ray followed.
After a brief lunch break, we lit a
candle and placed it at the top of the
climb, and then headed toward the
Cassell's Entrance, wondering just
where the hell the other group was.
For the rest of the trip, route-finding
was not an issue, but we continued to
flag just in case.
By this point in the trip, I had
mostly acclimated to the role of blind
caver. My head was thumping, the
. result of an encroaching migraine
headache induced by the fuzzy, altered
depth perception vision. This was
definitely not the time to break out the
Old Milwaukee. Yet, in a perverse
way, I realized that this trip was
wonderful. I was in a cave new to me,
accompanied by good friends, and we'd
soon be out of this hell hole and back
to OTR with a great excuse to party.
Not far from the top of the climb,
we entered a winding stream passage
with some waist deep potholes. After a
few minutes caving up this passage, we
finally met the other group. They
looked like they were having fun, and,
after assuring them that the route out
Windy was adequately flagged, we
parted company.
