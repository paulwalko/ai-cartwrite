One of our more adventurous (and
psychotic) club members wasn't
satisfied popping his Jiffy-PopÂ® the old
fashioned way. He donned his
firefighter gear and marched into the
flames! He survived the experience but
there is no report on whether or not the
popcorn tasted better.
The Halloween party, hosted by the
at Ranch, brought out some interesting
faces. There were dead men, talking
vegetables, and a Black Knight. Ko
Takamizawa and Joan Johnson came
as your worst nightmare: your parents!
The Mask (Dave Colatosti) circulated
the party until his green chin began to
fall off.
The party even supplied a cave
which was only difficult to manage by
those in long skirts or giant masks. The
Zo kids were overheard urging Mom to
"go through it before you get too
drunk!"
Lawrence Britt hosted his annual
Ocktoberfest with pub-style mugs and
tape for color-coding. Next time you
visit you can grab your mug from the
shelf to use. The sauerkraut and
sausage made those of German
descent feel right at home.
Das Boot started the evening off,
but it was the squeeze-box that livened
the party up.
Rumor has it that Lawrence has
bought a house on the corner of Penn
Street. Some of you may remember it
from parties in days gone by. Now all
he needs is a wife, a dog, and a white
picket fence to complete this cozy
picture.
Dave Cinsavich and Kim Hansen
hosted their annual Trim the Tree/Kill
the Cat Christmas party. Kim's
cranberry jello vodka shooters and
Dave's hot buttered rum made it difficult
to leave the kitchen. Fortunately much?
of the party was there, as any good
caver knows. One unfortunate soul
thought he could out-shot Dave and
Doug Perkins with rum and Wild
Turkey. I'm told he wasn't feeling very
well the next day.
Susan Vermeulen hosted an
alternate party that same night. Lots of
cavers showed up to help her celebrate
her birthday.
Several folks attended the "old fart"
New Year's party at Ed and Lynn
Richardson's beautiful home in Flint Hill.
Avid fans tried to hear the Sugar Bowl
over the sound of Joan Redder
shouting to Tech players, "Get the son-
of-a-bitch!" Sandy K. took over as party
bully by beating up on some of the
menfolk. Could the Whisky Sour Punch
have anything to do with it?
Fireworks and bottle rockets
marked the big moment and the
champagne was definitely flowing. It
was hard to make it through the room
without being hugged by all the well-
wishers.
After several years as a student,
Glen Davis has accepted a job with
Electro-Tec. It's unclear who is more
excited, Glen or Alice, who has been
planning to quit her job and begin
hiking the Appalachian Trail in March.
Speaking of the Trail, word has it
that Bryce Bolton has ceased his efforts
and has returned to work in the D.C.
area. He feared that the job wouldn't
wait for him any longer.
Caver weddings are on the rise this
year. For a complete lowdown, see the
list following the Grapevine.
Marriage seems to have settled in
for Sandy K. and Philip B. The
newlyweds hadn't been seen together
for several months after the wedding
(including at the reception!), but are
finally showing up in public as a couple.
