In Search of Caldwell Cave
by Suzie Warren
It was Sunday morning and I was still
recovering from the party the night before.
Somehow I managed to drag my body out
of bed and head over to Mike's house.
Five minutes after I arrived, James showed
up and we left on time...
Our destination was Caldwell Cave.
Mike said he had an idea where it was -
because he had talked to some people a
couple years ago who had been there. This
did not make me too faithful in finding the
cave, and I figured that I should really be
spending this time doing school work.
"Oh-well," I thought, "If we do find it, it
would be really groovy." So, I justified
the trip.
We arrived at the knoll where Mike
said the cave would be. "Somewhere on
the left there should be a heavily traveled
trail and a place to park on the right."
Mike and I headed up what later turned out
to be deer trails to poke around in the
woods. We split up and I headed toward a
dark spot. As I walked I noticed a thing
about 12 feet ahead of me. It was a four-
point buck sitting casually on the ground
staring at me as if I were interrupting it's
bath time. He got up and I then noticed
how large he was. He started walking off
in the direction of Mike. I shouted over to
Mike to tell him that a groggy buck was
wandering over his way. Mike got excited
when I started yelling over, thinking that I
found the caye. He, no doubt, was
disappointed when it turned out to be a
buck. Nonetheless the buck was pretty
cool. He stood a few yards away from
Mike and I, very confident that we were
not going to harm him.
Meanwhile, we had left James at the
road. He managed to snoop around an old
road and found a Polaroid of a very gross-
looking naked woman in a very dirty
house. We searched that road a bit more
and turned around after I stepped on rusty
barbed wire.
We drove up the road some more and
stopped at the top of a ridge. Mike and I
searched the left side, heading up an old
trail. Our effort was not too successful;
we turned around after we hit several
pickers and caught no sign of limestone.
When we returned to the car we walked up
the trail on the right where James had
gone. We found him after five or ten
minutes and he said he found a cave, but
he did not know if it was the right one.
We followed the trail and there it was . .
a really groovy entrance. Whether or not
this was Caldwell, we were going in.
Back to the car we went, got our gear, and
hiked the half mile back to the entrance.
The first thing that caught my
attention about the cave was the large
numbers of spiders and crickets that
covered every surface. It was like that
scene from "Indiana Jones and the Temple
of Doom."
After we poked our noses around in
the entrance, our next job was to find the
rest of the cave. Mike climbed up a wall
that looked as though other people had
traversed it. "I don't see what the-point is
in coming up here," he said. There was no
promising passage. James and I sat at the
bottom. "Maybe this isn't Caldwell," I said.
Just then Mike shouted to us that he found
the first drop. Alright, success!! We
scrambled up the wall and into this really
interesting, yet pain in the butt, crawl.
There it was, the pit. But there was a
slight problem. We had nowhere to rig.
After ten minutes we figured out the
rigging and dropped the pit. This nasty
crawl had opened itself out to a beautiful
40-50 foot drop.
