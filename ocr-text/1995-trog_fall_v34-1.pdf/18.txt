would help. Am I cold? Am I hungry?
How's that sprained ankle doing? Enquiring
minds should want to know.
Listening to the patient is also
important. Perhaps the noise played a role,
but I remember that I had to holler "Head
up" several times and still got no response
until someone else handling the Stokes
shouted the same thing.
Knowing where you are is nice. Since
I could only see the faces of the rescuers
and a brown darkness I assumed to be the
ceiling, I had no idea where in the cave we
were. An occasional comment about the
room we entered would help to mentally
place myself in the cave.
If the patient wants to be humored a
little, I don't see the harm in that. When I
asked Mikes (Horne) what was going on,
he told me they planned to pass me around
a butt ledge. Based on a previous
experience with the Newcastle Murder
Hole butt ledge, that phrase made me
nervous. After I mentioned this he called it
a "fanny walk." Okay, this sounds silly, but
it gave me a mental reign on the
nervousness. When you are physically
helpless, your mind is all you have to work
with.
Don't forget to include the patient as
part of the group. When we arrived at a
level place the crew stopped to work on
carbide lamps and have a snack. After
placing me gently on the floor everyone
scattered to form small groups. I felt rather
abandoned in the middle of the floor.
Thankfully Steve LePera noticed my
predicament and came to sit with me. He
dug food out of my pack and even helped
me take a drink of water.
Joan did a great job as traffic cop. She
made certain that everyone stood ready in
place before sending me across the bodies.
I felt more secure knowing that no moves
would be made hastily.
Joan and Ed's ability to accept
comments from others impressed me.
Neither of them acted with a macho "I'm
in charge" attitude. They asked for advice
and listened to suggestions. More than
once I heard Joan say, "You're right; that
may work better." When you're at the
mercy of others it's nice to know that the
folks in charge don't lose sight of your best
interest in a battle of egos.
What did I gain from the experience?
It made me aware of my own behavior
around a practice rescue patient. I
remember some things I did that were
meant as amusement which in retrospect
were probably tiresome. I will keep that
Saturday in mind when I'm once again a
rescuer.
If in future years the club is without a
patient volunteer for a practice rescue, I
would do it again. However, I strongly
recommend that others give it a try once
they have been on the rescuer side a time
or two. Perspective is a wonderful thing.
Thanks to everyone who helped out.
More important than any of the comments
above, trainees did participate and learn. I
wasn't dropped, burned, beaten, drenched,
or frightened into shock, which is more
than you can say about some of the parties
we attend!
