I learned the following things on
this trip:
1)
Sport glasses should not be used
caving. They should be sacrificed
to Mº's fire god, Ogma.
2)
If Ray thinks it's the right way,
then it is. He should be called
White Ray, which is dyslexish for
“right way”.
climbing up a chimney and looking
around for the next flag. Instead, they
saw the piece which they had
inadvertently bypassed, and the whole
group turned around and went the
wrong way. Eventually, they realized
the error of their chosen way, and got
back on the proper route. At the
connection climb, one of the New
Jersey cavers fell on the top portion,
and nearly bounced and fell down the
bottom portion as well. Luckily, there
was no serious injury. Complicating
things further, what were trivial
downclimbs in Windy proved a bit
more challenging as up climbs, slowing
the group even more.
After hearing of these trials, all of
us (except maybe Steve, who was
suffering severe OTR withdrawal)
quickly forgave them for being late.
We packed up the cars, checked out
with the landowner, and sped back
routes 92 and 219. Straightnin' them
curves, flattenin' them hills, someday
the highway might get 'em but the
caves never will.
Head pounding and gut churning
in the back of Reggie's smooth
handling Subaru, I took the opportunity
to reflect on the day's experience.
3) Random selection of three pieces
of accessory cord from one's shed
does not constitute adequate
preparation of an ascension system.
4) Reggie Reid is a space alien.
5) Ray Sira is more VPI than New
Jersey.
6)
Steve Wells doesn't always smile.
7)
Carl Bern is stoic.
8)
The VPI Cave Club has the most
honor.
Needless to say, it was an
unforgettable trip. The only way to
make it better would have been to stuff
my polypropylene with broken glass.
