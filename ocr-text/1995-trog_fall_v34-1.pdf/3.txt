Words from the Prez
by Alison Williams
I can't believe that this semester is
almost over! I think that it has been a
great semester for the cave club and I
have had a great time getting to know
all of the new faces. We have a
wonderful group of new trainees and I
look forward to seeing them remain
active with the club and get their
membership in the future.
I would like to thank all of the
members that have helped make this
semester so successful. I think that we
have had a lot of good trips this
semester and hopefully we will have
even more in the upcoming spring.
Special thanks to those people that
have returned to Blacksburg on
numerous occasions to lead trips; it has
been nice to see all of you more often.
And of course, all of those crazy
cavers that cave hard have done a
terrific job of partying hard. There
have been a plethora of parties this
semester and hopefully everyone has
been having a great time.
So, study hard for those finals and
head off to cave and relax afterwards.
I hope that you all have a very merry
Christmas and happy new year. I look
forward to seeing everyone back next
semester, so be safe over the holidays.
Take care and get excited about
