Wells, Ray Sira, Carl Bern, and myself
would enter the horizontal Windy
entrance, and flag the route as we
found our way to the Cassells
connection. Mike Miro, Alison Dineen,
and Andy ???? joined the four NNJG
cayers to rig and then enter the
Cassell's Pit Entrance. The two groups
would meet near the connection. Our
group was smaller since we would have
to climb rope.
Ray led us into the cave just after
1 p.m. No one else in our group had
even heard of this cave before
Thursday night, much less knew the
connection route. I pulled my new
sport glasses over my eyes just before I
ducked into the low entrance, eager to
see if the ugly shades were worth the
investment. My trusty wire-rimmed
glasses, caving companions for years,
would have to sit out this trip in the
glove box of Reggie's car. Subsequent
events made their retirement a brief
one.
The passage in the lower portion
of the cave typified that of the Elkins
area. Nothing too big, nothing too
small, nothing too pretty, nothing too
ugly, with enough tricky climbs and
hairy traverses too keep things
interesting. We caved quickly, and I
began to heat up. In response, my
glasses fogged over. No big deal, I
thought, they'll clear up once they
equilibrate to cave conditions.
About twenty minutes later, the
proverbial down-climb versus hairy
traverse choice presented itself. My
cave legs still in Blacksburg, I chose
the former. Near the bottom of the
climb, the quantity and quality of
footholds rapidly diminished. I was
only a couple of feet from the floor, so
I decided just to drop. Unfortunately,
two feet turned out to be five, and I
landed awkwardly, twisting my ankle.
This brought to mind an important
point one should keep in mind when
wearing new glasses. The perceived
focal point is different for every pair,
resulting in screwy depth perception.
Better be extra cautious until my
equilibrium adjusts, I thought, staring
through a fresh layer of fog on my
glasses.
As a listened to Reggie coming
down the climb behind me, my belief
that he is a space alien was reaffirmed.
Savagely impaled by his own
carelessness only three weeks earlier,
his inhuman regenerative powers had
quickly thwarted fate's attempt to make
him a hermaphrodite. All that
remained was a small pink scar on his
tush, which I had the dubious honor of
viewing later that weekend. His caving
was as effortless and annoying as ever.
On we caved, following Ray
blindly (one of us literally so), up
chimneys, down crawlways, and across
ledges. My glasses continued to fog no
matter what I did. At one point,
remembering a trick I frequently used
on my old spectacles, I spit on and
licked the lenses and then dried them
with a bandanna. They stayed clear for
a whopping thirty seconds. I decided,
then, to cave without glasses. Alas,
this did not work, as I found my
echolocation skills rather rusty, having
not used them since a former life. So I
resorted to other bodily fluids. No
matter which (or whose) orifice I chose
to extract it from, mucous worked no
better than saliva. Armpit sweat
performed only slightly better, and the
sole effect of crotch sweat was to give
the fog a bit of a greenish tint. At
least I confirmed that my body was not
capable of naturally producing a
miracle defogging agent. I did my best
