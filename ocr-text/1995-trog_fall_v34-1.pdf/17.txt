Could You Please Scratch my Nose?
My Experience as a Practice Rescue Patient

Friday night a week prior to the club's
annual practice rescue, I overheard Ed
Fortney grumbling about not having a
volunteer for the rescue patient. "If no one
else volunteers then I'll do it," I chimed in
foolishly. Someone laughed and said I
would be too easy, so I offered to put
rocks in my pockets. When I spoke to Ed
later that week, Surprise! No one else had
claimed the position. Unfortunately I forgot
the rocks
Now that my insides have settled and
I can reflect on the experience, I'd like to
offer some constructive comments.
The practice at the meeting the night
before helped greatly. It familiarized me
with the sensation of being passed and
lifted, and it gave the new folks a chance
to try it out on level, unthreatening ground.
For some just walking in a cave was new.
Oddly enough, we had a large member
turnout. Not as many trainees showed up
for the actual practice as we had hoped,
but we did have some. I'm glad that this
group recognizes the importance of our
practice rescues and of participating in club
events.
Once in the cave the same basic
mistakes appeared. Dusty webbing passed
over my face and sling hit me in the chin
four times while trainees strapped me into
the Stokes litter. I was not dripped on by a
carbide lamp, but the flame came too close
for comfort a time or two. These things
will always happen on a practice rescue
because the rescuers will (hopefully)
always be trainees who don't yet know the
proper techniques. Isn't that why we
practice?
One thing to keep in mind: Just
because I had no physical injuries does not
mean that I didn't feel uneasy. Consider
that I was strapped into the Stokes unable
to move or protect myself. I couldn't see
my surroundings and I had no idea what
was coming up. Imagine the feeling of
helplessness if the Stokes had slipped just
four feet before the belay caught.
Under these circumstances, the jokes
about my impending doom got real old,
real fast. "Oh, you'll just drop about 10
feet, no big deal." As the group began to
pass me around a ledge, someone thought
it funny to hum a gloomy tune. Let me tell
you, it was not funny to me. Perhaps the
jokers meant to help me relax. If that's the
case, stick to something like, "A guy
walked into a bar with a frog on his
shoulder ...."
The most important thing you can give
the patient is information. I had to ask
several times for people to tell me what
was happening. I'd hear Joan Johnson, our
traffic. cop, say, "Okay, do we all know
what to do?" and "Is everybody ready?"
The worst I overheard: "Do you people
over there feel comfortable? We can have
some of the members take your place." By
these questions I knew something slightly
tricky was about to happen, but I had no
idea what. This makes a person slightly
uneasy.
Lawrence Britt was good about telling
me when something particularly weird
came up. "Okay, we're gonna pass you
through this little duck-under, and it will
come close to your face, but there's plenty
of room." And later, "We're passing you
down a slope, so you may get fairly
vertical for a minute or two." These bits of
information allowed me to anticipate the
movement and not freak out.
Talk to the patient. Sounds simple, but
you'd be surprised at how infrequently
people spoke directly to me. Constant
chatter is not necessary, but frequent
questions about my condition and
information regarding the status of the trip
