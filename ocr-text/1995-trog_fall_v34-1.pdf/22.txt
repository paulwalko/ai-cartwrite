Consisting mostly of stream
canyon and easy walkways, duckwalks,
and crawlways, the Cassell's portion of
the system was much more quickly
than Windy, despite my aching head.
We soon reached what Ray described
as the infamous PSC crawl, a dig
which had resulted in discovering the
portion of Cassell's through which we
had just passed, including the Windy
connection. The easily negotiated
"Squeezes” in the dig confirmed the
suspicion that cavers from other grottos
tend to be a bit more stout that those of
VPI, including, believe it or not,
myself. Five minutes past the crawl
found us at the bottom of the 90 foot
Cassell's pit entrance. We gathered up
the vertical gear left behind by the
other group, and prepared to ascend. I
opened my pack to find, to my dismay,
that the three knots I'd quickly grabbed
from my gearbox consisted of two top
knots and the short leg knot. Ray,
Steve, and Reggie ascended, not
necessarily in that order. Then came
my turn. Steve had offered me his
rope walker for the climb, but I
decided greater honor would be
achieved by climbing knots. I realized
neither how tired I was nor how
inefficient my inappropriately chosen
knots would be.
About eight feet off the floor, I
realized I'd made a stupid decision.
Not unsafe, just stupid. So I decided to
stick with it. I climbed slowly, with
pounding head and zero visibility,
through the waterfall trickle near the
bottom of the pit. About twenty feet
up, my leather gloves both
disintegrated, resulting in the
generation of lovely blisters on my
fingers during the remaining 70 feet.
After over half an hour on rope, I
emerged into the cool West Virginia air
as a truly whipped individual. Nearly
hypothermic from having had to wait
so long for me, Carl popped over the
lip a few minutes later, a little over
four hours after having entered the
cave. We quickly derigged the pit.
Because I had taken so long, we were
concerned that the other group had
been waiting.
No such luck. After the short hike
back to our cars, we found only three
empty vehicles awaiting us. Initially,
we perceived this as a good thing. We
had more honor! Despite having to
climb the rope and flag the Windy
route, we had exited the cave first.
Two hours later, however, honor
seemed less important than getting back
to OTR, from which we could faintly
hear many eagerly anticipated libations
and vices calling our names.
Ordinarily, waiting for the second
group.on a cross-over trip to exit isn't
that bad. But when your returning to
Old Timers' instead of a pile of
textbooks or a dead end job, patience
no longer seems much of a virtue.
Nevertheless, we conducted the
customary while you wait rituals. An
excellent game of “fill up Mike Miro's
trunk with very small rocks under the
dubious auspices of target practice”
was played with gusto by all. Reggie
and I performed our soon to be
infamous Jun Ree martial arts
exhibition. And, all the while, we held
a round table discussion regarding how
lame the other group was and how it
sucked that we couldn't just return to
OTR.
Finally, around seven o'clock, the
other group came limping out of the
cave. They had followed the flagging
religiously. Unfortunately, this
involved missing a certain piece of tape
by traversing past it below, then
