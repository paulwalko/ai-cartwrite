Newberries:
A first underground vertical experience
by Amy M. Johnson
Ready to Rappel
Belay On
Rappeling
Rappel Away
And I begin the descension
towards the center
to a point beneath the outer crustal shell
of earth and soil.
A narrow crack and
sixty feet of darkness
between me
and the horizontal rock
on which others are now standing.
One hand steady, strong,
controlling-
the other shaking, unsure.
The rock encloses me,
engulfs me
Traveling through slick fractures widened
by water and geologic time
to the base that holds the
mountain above me.
Slow, uncertain,
Feeding the rope through
the rappel device in
areas of near horizontal
only to approach a
steeper face.
Slight apprehension
followed by action
as it encourages me to continue.
The rock opens
before one last descent
and I land on horizontal.
Down
Belay Off
Off Rope
Let's Cave
