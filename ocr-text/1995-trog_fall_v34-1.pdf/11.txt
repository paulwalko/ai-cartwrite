Useless Review
by Pam Mohr
VPI 143, NSS 12034
I feel like I'm living in a flashback!!
It all began in 1991. There I was, all
alone in Jacksonville, NC, and felt the
need to be near cavers -- my friends, my
family. So I moved back to Blacksburg,
where else? I attended VPI and was a Cave
Club member in '68-'72. Here it's the 90's
and I felt like a student/caver again. Young
and old cavers made my transition easy --
Thanks Everyone!
Then that old déjà vu started.
Someone was planning an NSS Convention
for 1995 in Blacksburg. I was living in the
dorm for the '71 Convention, now I live
just 2 miles from campus. Then and now I
helped on the Guidebook. Then and now
the person with the publishing knowledge
was KIM, Kim Smith in '71 and Kim
Hansen in '95. A local caver was in
charge; this year's co-chairman was Jim
Washington, and 24 years ago Jim Dawson
was the caver with the headaches. I can't
help but feel that the cycle of life is
operating in excess mode. More duality
then and now: I helped with Campground
Security (really more like an excuse to talk
to everyone).
I could continue with more examples,
but I'll just end with these two words:
TEXAS SHOWERS.
Beware and enjoy: Caving is
Addictive!
