Congratulations to James Whisenhunt,
Wil Orndorff, and Ray Sira, our new
members for this semester. I am certain
that we will have several more trainees
coming up for membership in the spring.
Thank you to everyone who took on the
organization of major events this semester:
Lawrence Britt for Octoberfest, Suzie
Warren and the Bat Ranch residents for the
... Halloween party Captain Ed Fortney and
Eileen O'Malley as coordinator and victim
respectively in the practice rescue. A big
thank you should also go to all of the
people who for one reason or another
opened their residences to us for the Friday
night parties. Maybe we can find some
new locations for these in the spring so
that the same people don't get stuck with it
all the time. Let's try to make next
semester even better than this past one.
Party hard, cave hard.
Once again the semester has
slipped by fast enough to make a
person wonder where it all went. I do
know what happened to my weekends
in the past months. Most of them were
spent underground with the dozens of
people who checked the club out this
semester. Out of that enormous group
we have gotten a solid core of
promising trainees and I have had a -
blast caving with them. The
enthusiasm for caving they possess is
infectious..
I truly appreciate all of the help I
received with training this semester.
Thank you everyone who led trips,
helped me lead trips, assisted with the
vertical training at the quarry, or lent
me their gear for those 'cast of
thousands' trips; you all know who you
are. Next semester promises to be just
as exciting. It will be difficult for the
supply of trips to meet the demand
until the active member to trainee ratio
begins to balance out. I regret that I
won't be able to help out as much next
semester, but I will be hiking the
Appalachian Trail starting in March. I
should be back in the fall to help out
with next year's trainees, but after
Bryce's many months on the Trail I
don't think I should guarantee that. So
it's up to the members to keep training
trips plentiful and the trainees should
cajole and connive the members if they
cannot find a trip.
With regards to the club gear, what
we have right now is in good shape. I
do know however that there are lamps,
etc., floating around out there that need
repair. If you have club gear in good
condition or bad please return it so
that we can figure out what we have
