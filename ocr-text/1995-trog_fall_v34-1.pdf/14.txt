(A couple of whats, we don't know.)
Where there is marriage there are
children (but thank heavens not
always). Wil and Zenah Orndorff are
expecting another baby soon. Sue
Setzler and Doug Bruce are expecting
their first in April. Have they picked out
names? Speculation is that if it's a boy
he'll be named Bam-Bam.
Some said it would never happen,
but after five years Laine Buckwalter is
finally moving out from Old Signout on
Eakin, She'll be renting a room in a
boarding house on Roanoke Street.
Alas, the Spotted Wonder will not
accompany her on this venture. The
move comes just in time to escape
some alleged employee disagreements
at B&C.
Cecile still intends to move to
Tennessee; the latest word is that she'll
be moving and taking B&C with her
around August '96.
Natalie Serbu joins the VPl faction
in Colorado for a several month
internship. She and Jeff Jablonski
snuck in a quick late-night visit to
Blacksburg on the way out west.
Thope everyone will attend this
year's Banquet on February 17. (May
Mother Nature grace us with a snow-
free weekend.) The catering will be
done by Steve "Tink" Williams, a caver
from years ago who's been caving with
a few of the old farts. Phil Lucas, the
speaker, has lots of interesting things to
present and the music afterwards will
be hot!
