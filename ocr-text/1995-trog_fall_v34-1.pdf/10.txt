All muscles contract,
pulling to the top.
Sweet adrenaline-
tiring.
The final challenge awaits.
Reaching the final ascension,
true fear takes hold
and I look for comfort
and reassurance from those
who climbed before.
With ascender in place
I begin the horrifying climb-
The last before breaking the
boundary of soil and rock.
Hand and footholds are many.
Tired muscles reach for these
and push and pull to the next.
Beneath me is only darkness.
Hand- hand- Pull
Foot-foot- Push
Adjust ascender to prevent
Falling too far.
Slowly, wearily, painfully,
I reach air, plants.
Above soil.
And I collapse
above the rock that
enveloped me.
Unable to move.
Unable to speak
Overwhelmed by the experience.
Time and reflection reveals
Overcoming of fears,
Facing of new challenges.
A weary exploration,
but it encompasses
every part of me.
And it will engulf me
Again.
