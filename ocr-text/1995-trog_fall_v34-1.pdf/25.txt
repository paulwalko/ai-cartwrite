Made in the Shade with Rubbermaid
by Chris Lattin
Truly, the possibilities are endless and
creativity means versatility. It even comes
with a top that snaps on for a locked
tightness that cannot be beaten. And yes,
I've even come up with some great ways
to use the top. I've found the top to be:
I've been caving since I was a junior
in high school and I've found many useful
inventions that make my life much nicer:
cordura, fleece, wool, the fire of a carbide
lamp, water (I've gotta cover the essentials
even though I discovered water a couple of
years before I started caving), and of
course anything that mentioned
“mechanical.” However, nothing has been
more useful than my Rubbermaid
ROUGHNECK. Its a small
rubber/polymer-based container which can
haul about 20 gallons of whatever you
wish to put in it. Mine is the beautiful
green and tan two-toner. (Well, the store
didn't have green tops; I had to
compromise) These are only minor details
for size, looks, and the slender lines are
only just a few of the features of this
fantastic magic box.
1. A great place to stand when changing
for caving,
A fantastic snow sled (wax is
advised),
3. A romantic breakfast-in-bed tray,
A plate (I was desperate and hungry),
5. Amazing with a pillow underneath, it's
like that great little “lap desk” I had as
a kid,
6. Floor mats for your car (especially if
your floorboards are rusted out like
mind);
7. With skates makes a jammin'
skateboard,
8. Something to catch those nasty grease
splooges that fall only when you're
under your car but which will ruin
your driveway.
I have found the tub useful for:
1. hauling dirty cave gear,
2. hauling clean after-cave clothes
(sometimes 1&2 simultaneously),
3. a laundry basket,
4 upside down it makes a great
umbrella/hat for rainy days,
5. When money is tight it can be used as
cozy living quarters,
Food storage, junk storage, mutilated
body parts storage (your imagination
is your only limit here),
7. A bucket for washing the car,
8. A very dark fish tank,
9. A planter,
10. Strap roller skates on the bottom for
an indestructible go-kart,
11. A true port-a-pot (I recommend
against using it for anything else after
that; at that point it's time to get a
new one).
And yes, it even makes a great
projectile. It's much like a Frisbee but not
as aerodynamic or graceful. It can do a
whole lot of damage so BE CAREFUL!
(Some of us need to be reminded)
Together the top and bottom can be
assembled to form a comfortable form-
fitting chair or the tub can be inverted, the
lid placed on top, to form a picnic table.
All this and more for the amazing
price of only $6.95 (at least that's what I
paid; they may cost more these days but
maybe you can get a matching top and
bottom).
