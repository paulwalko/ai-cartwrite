FALLOUT SHELTERS:
.. Recently the Civil Defense office released a list of all caves which hảve
been" designated as fallout shelters, " This listing of over 400.caves, approximately
25 of which are in Virginia, is in the hands of Russell Gurnee. It will be
circulated when the appropriate time arises for the local grottos. to check:
the caves in their area against a prepared check list,
::It is felt that in order to perform any service to the civil 'defense program
and to the idea of cave conservation, N.sis, members: must accept the coricépė :
that:; there are some caves which really would make a de quate fallout Shelters
There are various reasons; however, whiy many caves are not so suited nisisi mem-
bers must admit this to themselves if any progress is to be made Rather than
decrying the whole program" as such, we must be able to impassionately point
out its shortcomings and inconsistencies, while recognizing its merits.. ..:
„Many aspects of the program are unrealistic, perhaps because of lack of
knowledge by the persons who made the surveys or the inconsis.tancy of evalutions.
across the country: For example, the listed capacities for Luray and Mammoth
Caves are nearly equal, and some smaller Caves in the Ozark region have far
larger capacity evaluations,
,, 'I feel that'wę, must work with these people, where possible in an effort :
se to, guide them as much as possible away fromrundesirable: caves and to encourage
a high degree of consciousness for the preservation of speleologic features:
If we simply cry "no", our cries will be unheard; but if we say maybe so,..
but how about this...........", our advice will more than likely be accepted
with the sincerity with which it is offered.
