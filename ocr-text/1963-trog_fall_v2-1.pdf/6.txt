ARE THERE ANY CAVES IN TENNESSEE?
There are caves in Tennessee. I know there 'arÄ—. After all some guy named
Barr wrote a book about them. Besides that, everybody knows they're there. It's
just that they don't know where they are. Or if they do, they won't let you in.
..
At least in Southwest Virginia the people can say it's "over yonder, about
as fer as from hyere to thyere," and point in the right general direction, But
not in Tennessee.
My first experience with a Tennessee cave was Carter County Saltpeter.
Barr says it is "a large and well-known cave, but it is very hard to find." Amen,
brother.
Buck Cuddy and I looked for it on our way to the Chattanooga Convention. We
got directions at a drug store, again at the owner's house, again at a little
shack half way up the mountain, each one of these fine personages concluding with
the fabled remark 'Ya cain't miss hit." Needless to say we did -- for well over
two hours. Which isn't easy with an entrance 35' by 10'. This cave did
have one of the most beautiful terraces of rimstone dams I have seen.
On the same trip, we then headed for the Gouffre with general directions
from the discoverer, Bill Cuddington. Everyone in the area knew it was 'lup
the hollow" or "up the ole logging road." After about 6 hours of searching
we were heading from one logging road to the next when I fell off the car (at
about 45 mph), breaking my arm and messing up a few other parts of my anatomy;
so we gave up and headed for the banquet at Cumberland Caverns and thence to a
Chattanooga hospital.
The next time I got a chance to go caving in Tennessee was this past
summer when Bonnie and I headed for the Smoky Mountains for a week. We found
Gregory's Cave by following the fallout Shelter signs. The last sign had
a mate which read "Warning - Prior written approval from Park Headquarters
required before any park cave may be enterred. With a few friendly remarks for
the National Park Service we decided to look for Bull Cave to see if it too was
marked. When we finally found Bull, it was only because of the lane of "Warning....
.........." signs which led us to it.
The next logical step was Park Headquarters where we looked up the head
ranger, and explained our desires. Apparently the only way to get into the caves
is through a legitimate scientific project. After listening patiently for a
while, we let them know in no few words what we thought of National Park Service
Policy and then went for a hike to cool off. I still question their policy
regarding the Park's caves,
On the way home we decided to stop at Cedar Creek Cave in Greene County.
The first man we asked for directions guided us to the parking lot behind the
grammar school. It turned out later that he had been correct in every detail
except that he had right and left backwards. in every instance. The second, third,
and fourth groups of instructions were somewhat inferior, so when we got to be half
way up the mountain Barr says the cave is at the base of, we decided to head back,
The fifth fellow got us in the right vicinity, and we searched until we found it.
By then we were so exhausted we explored a short distance, and headed home.
And that is what makes life challenging!
