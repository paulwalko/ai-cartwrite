WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE?
Last Spring a quiz was given to 33 members and trainees of the cave club.
With a great variety of questions it revealed several interesting things. For
example, 15 of the 33 did not know the full name of the club, "The VPI Grotto
of the NSS," as stated in the constitution. Only 7 were able to name 3
minerals of which speleothems are likely to be composed. In addition, 11 did not
know the club's vice president, 14 did not know the location of the club's
files, 22 did not know what governs the temperature of a cave, and 22 did not
the club's policy governing the use of a chest prusik on rappels. Ten knew
who was president of the NSS, 6 knew how to spell "pruzzik" (see Baltimore
Grotto News, V6, No. 1, p. 18), and 14 thought that Myotis lucifus was a salamander.
. . Happily the best grades were concentrated among our oldest members, but
the test did show an inadequacy in the instruction given to our new members.
Apparently most of the information is just picked up with time, as the grades attest.
A few "chicken" questions kept the grades down somewhat, but Ed Day led the
pack with 95% and "J. Houk," whom we suspect to be Jim Saunders, came home with
a 26% - but was given credit for some aosyete like "One is the minumum
safe caving party, ask Floyd Collins.!', to destroy a possible. zero %.
Questions on the favorite and least favorite caves had 26 different.
caves mentioned in the former category, 22 in the latter, with 8 being
mentioned on both lists. It all depends on what you like. "New River was least
popular, Clover Hollow most popular.

FALSE ALARM RESCUE
Last Spring, confusion over the supposed time of return of a caving trip
demonstrated the ability of the y.P.I Cave Club to organize rapidly an efficient
rescue party. When what was understood to be a short afternoon trip to Pig
Hole Cave had not returned by midnight, it was decided advisable to investigate
the cause of delay. The original alarm was sounded by safety chairman Tom
Bell; within 45 minutes a party of four was on its way to the cave, fully
armed for any situation which might be encountered in the vertical cave. At
least 5 others had been notified and were standing by in case the situation
should require more manpower.
Apparently the caving group and the supposed rescue party passed some-
where along the route for the cave showed no signs of inhabitants. Upon
returning to campus just after 2:00 am the rescue party found the victims
safely tucked in their beds.
The incident did demonstrate, however, the necessity for establishing, a
more precise method of noting anticipated time of return of cave, trips, but
also showed the ability of this club to form quickly and efficiently an effective
rescue party.
