Address all corrrspondence to the editor.
Every now and then we sit back and think a word of praise for the grottoes
with the time and energy to get their publications off the table on a fairly
reasonable schedule. A lot of time and energy is required.
It's been a long time since this publication last hit the mails but as
was once said "we're not dead, just asleep" But then we look at statistics like
those found below cn caving time and realize we've not been asleep at all, just quiet.
We apparently spend so much time caving we don't have time to write about it.
Anyhow, here it is for 1963. A small idea of what's been going on in the
VPI Grotto.
We hope to appear often enough in the future to let the world know what's
going on down here. In the next issue, whenever that may be, look for a
comprehensive report on the caves of Burkes Garden, Virginia, plus other material
submitted by individuals whose arms we were able to twist..
This is titled Vol. 2, No. 1, but just for the record, 1963 is Vol. 2,
1964 will begin Vol. 3.
WORLD'S MOST ACTIVE CAVING GROUP
The VPI Grotto has long felt that it was probably the most active local
caving organization in this country. In order to substantiate this calim, Gary
McCutchen undertook to tabulate all caving activity within the group for the period
Sept. 18, 1963 - Dec. 13, 1963. This tabulation accounted for a'total of
49 trips to 3 different caves, and acaimulative total of 967 manhours underground.
.
Any crganization which feels it might be able to contest these results is
encouraged to record similar data for a similar length of time and submit it for
comparison. Figures listed here are for the fall academic quarter of school.
For a period slightly less than 12 weeks long, the above statistics breakdown
to 4.08 separate trips per week (excluding numerous rock climbing trips) with
19.73 hours per trip. This includes No time spent sleeping, but all active caving.
Although 34 different caves were visited during this period, it fails to show a
true picture, .for each cave was counted only once although 5 of them were visited
4 or more times, and one cave 7 times. Hours spent or trips taken to simply
locate caves were not included.
