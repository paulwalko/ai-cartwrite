WHITEY EUBANK, HERO
The "Hero" medal wa'si recently presented to Whitey Eubank for 'contributions
to speleology above and beyond..icio."!
Try to imagine what a female reporter for a small town weekly newspaper
might do with a story on a cave explorer and you may get some idea of the lengthy
front page spread Whitey got during the summer. Complete with six photographs :
one of whitey with white shirt, tie, and hard hat - the article was yellow
journalism plus.
It's inspiring to occassionally be reminded of the dashing heroism of those.
around you.
The facts of the interview were badly mauled, but Whitey did successfully
convey his views on conservation. He also presented a favorable picture of the
N.S.S. - what it is and what it does :- and generally gave an excellent and
correctly oriented picture for non-cavers. .

A HARD HAT REALLY HELPS
I noticed on page 30 of the May issue of the Potomac Cayer where Jim
Fox said, "My ..... hard hat shielded the first blow", and on page 31, "A
chin strap would have kept the hard had on:" But in the check list for new
members on page 33, what has happened to the hard hat and chin strap? . It
is felt to be not an "important point" (i.e, it is not marked with an asterik), ..
but is listed for vertical caves only - and the chin strap is merely a
"suggestion.!! :
I personally feel, and know that most cavers will agree, that the hard hat
is of.primary necessity for safe caving and that every person should be encouraged
to wear one at all times, in all caves. Mr. Fox seems rather inconsistent, and
it seems an effort should be made to correct the PSC's "check list" before it.
is extensively read by new cavers. ".. .
.
A recent fall by a V.P.I. caver points out the same fact regarding hard
hats and chin straps. The climb out of Warm River Cave is not difficult, but
one slip on a slippery foothold was all it took, :His hard hat protected him
on the initial blow, but rolled free because of the lack of a chin strap, and he
suffered a few cuts on the head rolling down the slope at the base of the climb.
LETTER TO THE EDITOR
. I like most of the content of the Tech Troglodyte, but I deplore the use of
the hairy ape as an emblem or masthead. Am I alone in my adverse criticism of ..
the beast?
