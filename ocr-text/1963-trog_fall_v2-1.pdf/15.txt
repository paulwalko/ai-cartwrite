:"CAVING" IN NEW JERSEY
: We hear big things from our "foreign correspondent" Ed Bauer who has
graduated from this area to the "big cave country" of New Jersey. He writes:
""My first trip with the NNJ Grotto.. was a real fiasco. Two. caves were real D.

could have had more fun and seen more, crawling under my side porch. The
second cave actually had what could be called a room, although it was '::::::::
impossible to stand up. Because part of the cave was flooded we saw as
much as possible in 15 minutes, 10 being“: spent: getting in and out the entrance."
We pause for the shedding:0f;a tear...
"We drove up to Northern Vermont (Middleburg) Friday night and camped on the

It descends steeply to a "T" intersection some 50 feet from the entrance. Up-
stream, to the right, the cave goes under a very low ledge which requires laying
in the water; it then opens up to walking height and continues for about 150 feet
through a very narry but attractively decorated passage to the small impassable
hole through which the stream enters.
Downstream the cave continues as a narrow stream passage, sometimes a high canyon
more easily traversed at higher levels. In about 250 feet the cave opens into a
moderate sized room with some attractive stalactites and the stream plunges over a
