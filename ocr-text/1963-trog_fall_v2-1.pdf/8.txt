WAR STORIES
A new term has been coined to describe the typical trip report presented
at cave club meetings. It was decided that the term "trip report" should
refer only to trips on which some contribution of merit or significant discovery
was made (10% of all trips). Reports of typical trips will henceforth be
known as llwar stories." For an example of a 'war story" consult any issue of
the Baltimore Grotto News.
Our friends from Baltimore say
That it's silly to use a belay.
They fuss and they feud,.''
And consider us prude,
And sit on their haunches and bray.
NEWCASTLE MURDER HOLE MAY BE REOPENED
Newcastle Murder Hole, which was closed to cavers nearly two years ago
because of excessive discourtesies on the part of many, will hopefully be made
accessible to competent cavers within the next several months.
The cave has been passed on to another generation of the Sizer's and its
status will be known shortly after division of the estate is completed. The
presumed new owner seems quite receptive to having competent; considerate
individuals enter his cave. A register. will probably be instituted at his home
so that he can keep track of the individuals who come and go from the cave,
Future developments will be noted as they occur, but at present it seems
wise to proceed with moderation.
LINK'S CAVE TO BE Ä ATED.
At the request of its owner, Link's Cave, Giles County, is presently being
gated. The gate of welded concrete reinforcing rods is being constructed by a
committee headed by Ed Day, Keys will be retained by both the owner and the
VPI Cave Club and will be available to any reliable individuals. A pla que
is scheduled for installation, also, to explain the reasons for the gate and how
entry may be gained. The second and higher entrance to the cave, some 15 feet
away, has been blocked with large fragments of rock,
Link's is a comparatively small but well decorated cave. Mr. Link recently
became concerned because of a large increase in the number of visitors and
proposed the gate to members of the Cave Club.
