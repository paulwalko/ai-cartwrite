a portable, gasoline-driven generator near the cave entrance...
Reels of power cable were strung inside the cave. Special containers had..

ications network was established using sound-powered telephones to maintain con-
tact between the surface and sub-surface group's ......
The final step in organization of the expetition was the enlistment of the
team members. They were exploration team, Jerry schuder and Bob Snively; power
technician, Kerford Brooks; cable handler, Larry Woosley; communications, Lida
Snively; photography, Al Scarbrough; lighting assistant, Tom Vigour, and support,
