small climable drop to a lower, muddier level. A muddy "S" curve crawl, tight
enough that your body partially dams the flow of water leads to another muddy
little room and a siphon. A small torturous lead' heads to the left and tends
vaguely toward the entrance for over 300"feet, and a high lead permits one to
climb over the siphon and continue fo." 75 feet before it, too, becomes impassable.
The cave is extremely muddy and cannot be seen to any. degree of completeness
without getting wet. Total length must be in the vicinity of 700 feet, making
it one of the 3 biggest caves in Montgomery county. It is probably subject to
some flooding as the sinkhole it is in and the numerous others around it drain
a quite extensive area.

George Fairer, a rock-climber grand
Can scale any cliff with just one hand;
But his head got kinda hard
And he thinks that he's the Lord
So he preaches safety to our sinful band.

A fellow whose nickname is Joe
Can talk like the wind can blow
You'll see what I mean
When he comes on the scene
Other cavers find somewhere to go.
