FIVE CRAIG COUNTY CAVES VISITED
During the Fall, five small caves along Sinking Creek Valley in
Craig County were investigated. A cave was known to exist at Bent Fisher's,
but the information on it was incomplete: : Frank Given's was known and well
described, but the other three were previously unreported.
Plea.
:: Keffet's was the orily: cävė which turned out to be significant. The entrance
is on a steep hillside just above a. wet: teather resurgence. During very high water,
water reportedly flows from the cave entrance also: The cave was completely dry
as was the spring below on the day of our visit.
• The entrance is a tight squeeze opening between boulders into a dirt floored
crawlway. Fifty feet from the entrance is a small room seven feet'high. The
passage descends from the room to a dry stream channel three feet high which con-
tinues for another sixty feet to a quite large room floored with mounds of mud,
The stream channel is along the left of the room and is followed to the end of the
cave where it emerges from a pile of rubble.
A small upper level is developed above a 90° turn at 190 feet from the entrance,
Total length is about 260 feet.
