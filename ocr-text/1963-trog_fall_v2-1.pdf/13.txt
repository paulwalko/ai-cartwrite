TRIP TO GERMANY VALLEY
by Gary McCutchen
Ed Day and I had planned a trip to Schoolhouse Cave over the weekend of
July 5-7. No one else was able to go, so- Ed drove to Charlottesville, met me,
and I drove on from there.
We got to the fieldhouse about 1:30 a.m., talked for awhile to the seven
or eight others there, and hit the sack.
No one was going to School House Cave that Saturday, so we visited nearby
Fieldhouse Cave. A 20 foot deep sinkhole and a narrow squeeze lead to a "T"
junction with the main passage. We went to the left and crossed one pit before
reaching the end of the passage.. Retracing our steps, we reached the entrance
squeeze and continued on down the main passage. It soon ends in a series of pits.
Ed descended into one, discovering that the water in the bottom was deeper than
it looked and also discovering that he could have climbed down into it without
getting wet.
A hole six feet up in a wall near the water pit attracted our attemtion.
Inside we discovered a 50 foot deep pit blocking further progress.. A four
inch wide ledge on one side of the pit was the only possible crossing point.
I got into belay position and Ed somehow got across. He was soon back with a
report of more pits, but we decided to return to the surface.
It was early afternoon when we emerged, so I was given a tour of the area. We
drove through a quarry, ignoring DANGER: BLASTING and KEEP OUT signs, saw Judy
Springs, went in Schoolhouse to the Jumping-Off Place, saw Seneca Rocks, and
looked down into Hellhole Cave.
After visiting Spruce Knob, the highest mountain in West Virginia, we decided
to see Blackwater Falls State Park. It is only 30 miles from Mouth-of Seneca; the
main attraction is 65 foot high Blackwater Falls.
There is a dry area in the center of the waterfall where the rock is higher.
Water falls on either side of this point. Looking at the falls, Ed and I
suddenly decided to rappel it. We went back to the car, changed clothes at the
concession area, and got all but one rope in a sack, Trying to look inconspicuous,
we crossed the stream above the falls, then jumped to a rock and then to the dry ,
area, both jumps made only three feet from the edge of the falls,
One rope was secured around a boulder upstream, A second rope was tied
to it and dropped over the edge. By this time, tourists were gathering and fran-
tically setting up cameras and tripods.
Ed went over first and put on a good show. He then swam the 50 feet to shore.
As I began my descent, I caught my hand on the breakover. I couldn't pull it out,
and began to wish I was someplace else. Finally, I rolled the rope off of it
and descended. Then I discovered what Ed had been trying to tell me: not to
try swimming with my gloves on.
We were asked only one question, by several people: " Why did you do it?"
Wet, tired, and happy, we headed back to Charlottesville.
