I was really disappointed when I couldn't get the key for the gate inside.
Our friend Dick had quite a bit of trouble in this cave, also, since while
canyon hopping his light kept falling off his helmet and into the stream, .....
Since we had a 12 hour trip ahead of us we decided to head home. Although ....
I was happy just to go caving. I was a little dissappointed at the turn of events;
especially not being able to see Piercy's Mill Cave, . It might be a good idea to . .
spread the word around that this cave, which is rated so highly by Davies,
is closed. since the road to his house really ruins the car.ios
Editor's Note: In the remainder of his letter, Ed expressed cons I'derable
disapproval of his not being allowed to have the key to the interior section of ,
McClungs, and rightfully so. It is unpleasant to think that competent cavers
are let into a cave, only under the watchful eye of he who 'Installed the gate,
and only when their assistance is desired.
Gates which keep out the average passerby are one thing, but gates which : ..
keep out compëtent, conscientious caver's are definately wrong: Some arrangements
should be made so that capable people can get admittance without an unreasonable ::
amount of red tape,

FROM THE D.C. SPELEOGRAPH
I recently ran across an interesting paragraph in the D.c:Speleográph
The article is by Lee Gilman and is about Mystic Cave, Pendleton County, West
Virginia.

"A11 of us traversed the first pool with varying degrees of wetness....
All of us went back as far as the second, in which one would have to get wet to
get across....I headed up a committee which was searching for a way to get around
this pool by way of an upper level. It would be possible to do this, but ..
expansion bolts would be needed." I
This points out how dangerous it is to say it's "impossible" because there
frequently turns up some fool who's done it. Yes, Lee, it's been done. .
The same issue of the D.C. Speleograph announced the resignation, as editor,
of Henry Douglas so that he can devote his full energies toward publication
of the Virginia Cave Survey. It will be published by a private concern, hopefully
in the near future. Lyle Conrad will assume editorship of the Speleograph.
