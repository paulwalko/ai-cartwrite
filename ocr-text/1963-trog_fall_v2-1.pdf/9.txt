MORE PASSAGE IN LINK'S CAVE
Surprisesr continue to occur in the relatively small Link's Cave, Giles ::
County, Virginia.' This summer over: 300; feet: of caye, not virgin, but previously
unknown' to this club, were discovered. A zigzag, canyon developed along :
vertical jointing departs to the right of the old part of the cave, about 300 feet.
into the cave and works: back towardrithe cliff face, i ending, in a 30 foot drop
to a fairly large room. The room contained large quantities of nuts., leaves,
fecal deposits, and one observed cave rat.
Hoping to establish contact with the surface both from this point and the
small room at the end of the crawlway in the back of the: cave, cavers with
strong lungs were stationed inside, while others crisscrossed the corresponding
areas on the surface. No voice contact with the surface was made.

....We drove right:100 the mouth ºf. Grapevine, rappelled in on-two, ropes and..
had a ball:checking out the cave - took lots of pictures and were very impressed
My friend Bren didn't have any trouble pruşşiking:out, but the other fellow, ::.
Dick, pooped out at the first ledge, and as I passed him he informed me that the
VW might be put to.. some good use: and pull him out. Since it was cold as the devil
outside, I decided to forget George's hoisting method and instead hauled him
out with the WW. It was quite an experience for his first cave.
We then checked into a motel in Lewisburg and washed up, ate dinner and
sacked out. Following my ancient topo map we drove 10 miles: on back logging :: 7.
roads the next morning to the site of Piercy's Mill Cave and were very impressed
with the large portal and stream: I asked the.. farmer, who : lived there, :

So went our conversation and we had to retrace our steps back to Lewisburg
in search of another cave. The owner was in church so we headed for McClungs.
