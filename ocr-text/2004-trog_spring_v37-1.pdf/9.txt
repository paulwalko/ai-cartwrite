The Ballad of Bane's Spring
By Brian McCarter
One meeting last year, an old fart declared,
“There's work to be done, and this work is best shared!
Let's all go to see how my last survey fared.”
The name of the caye was Bane's Spring.
The plan was to get to some points below ground,
Then transmit a signal until it was found.
The old fart would meanwhile stack up a mound
Of beer cans over Bane’s Spring.
“Radio-location,” he said, “will allow
For reduction of error, and glitches, and how!
Our survey needs help! So get going now!"
With that, we prepared for Bane's Spring.
Such was our load when we packed up our gear:
Antennas, and batteries, but sadly no beer.
At that point I thought I had nothing to fear.
I knew not the woe of Bane's Spring.
The entrance was neither too grim nor too tight.
I could stretch out, and an elephant might.
But as we walked on, my heart filled with spite.
Whose idea was this awful Bane's Spring?
Crawlng, and stooping, and breathing in dust.
I couldn't go on, but I knew that I must!
All I could think of was soft pizza crust.
Instead I just chewed on Bane's Spring.
We got to the points, on time without fail.
We sent out our signal, an electrical wail.
Meanwhile I looked for a cab I could hail.
Get me out! I'm stuck in Bane's Spring!
At last we arrived at the end of our trek.
The old fart had fled with no thanks, just neglect."
Next time he needs help, I'll write him check.
I will not return to Bane's Spring.
I swear there was never a nastier cave!
It fit me around like a fresh dug grave.
I used to think I was hardy and brave,
But it kicked my ass: Bane's Spring.
