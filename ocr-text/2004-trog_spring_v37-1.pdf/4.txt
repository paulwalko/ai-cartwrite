Traffic Cone Mud Bucket
By Mark Eisenbies
Last fall the caye/dig RosePetal Snowflake was discovered in Bland County. The dig
currently produces mud of a peanut butter consistency that must be hauled 50 feet from the dig to the
entrance through two crawls and up the entrance. The first few digs involved putting the mud into
cave packs, but it is almost impossible to remove. In search of an alternative we came up with a
reasonably good solution involving a bucket made from an 18-inch traffic cone. Good enough that
haul crews began to refuse to use the bags in favor of waiting for the limited number of cones to
cycle.
As a bucket, traffic cones have proven to be superior to other methods on several counts. (1)
They are easy to fill; the cone can nestle in the digger's armpit in tight digs. (2) They pass through
tight passages nicely; the soft sides prevent them from snagging firmly even on craggy walls with
redirections. (3) They are easy to empty; the hole on the other end prevents suction from forming and
the PVC acts like Teflon with mud (needs to be cleaned occasionally at the dig to restore non-stick
properties). (4) They are durable; you can beat the living snot out of them when the mud fails to
come out easily. (5) They are inexpensive; less than $10 from Home Depot if you don't want to steal
one.
Making the bucket is easy. An 18-inch cone is the preferred size because the taper on taller
cones gives them less volume.
