Slot
Step 2: Cut four 1-inch slots at 0 120, and 240 degrees. Use a pair of slots parallel to the lip
at 0 degrees, and angled slots at 120 and 240 degrees. This will create a 2-handle bucket with straps
that are easy to move out of the way for filling and emptying.
Clip Carabiner
Through Two
Handles
Step 3: Thread about 3 1/2 to 4 feet of webbing through your 1-inch slots to form handles.
Secure with a water knot. Adjust straps to make the handles even.
Step 4: Clip an old carabiner through the handles. Slide biner toward the dual slot so that the
straps can be moved out of the way for filling and emptying.
Step 5: Find a dig.
I think this bucket could be modified into a pack for longer trips. It is certainly flexible
enough to be folded into a pack. For sticky/muddy digs, this bucket has proven to be a real asset to
quick removal of material; especially when that material has to be hauled a fair distance through tight
crawls.
