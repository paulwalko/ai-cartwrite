Grotto Grapevine
By AI Cartwright
New couple, Rob Story and Carrie
Blankenship, made their first public debut at
Easterbeer. Rumor has it that the older wiser
Carrie heard of Rob's date-worthiness through
the unpublished grotto grapevine. The couple
has been coupling since early March.
Although this semester has seen a
hoard of new faces, one will surely be missed.
Lisa Gough, a local kindergarten teacher, has
fled the club. She seemed to have a good time
at Banquet, scoping out the younger guys. It
has been suggested that a date with Brad is
enough to turn any girl away.
Congratulations to those completing
their degrees this semester! Mark Eisenbies
will finish his doctorate work. There was an
inkling that he may stay in town because of
Tech's offer of a post-doc. YAY! Carrie
Blankenship will complete her masters.
Although she doesn't have a post-doc offer,
Carrie is expected to stick around the club.
For what reason, we don't know...
Niki LeBranch bought a townhouse at
Oak Tree. Samantha Lambert and Chris
Gargulio moved to a different house out on
Spruce Run and out of their Zells Mill trailer.
Chris has about a month to engage Sam before
their one year goal expires.
Mike Cole was molested at the After-
Banquet party by some anonymous woman.
Go MIKE!
Ray Sira and Kirk Digby showed
unusual excitement over Animal Planet's
special on Cave Elephants. “These rare, cave-
dwelling elephants spend as much time above
ground as they do beneath it, feeling their way,
trunk to tail, into the depths, where remote
cameras capture them sleeping, splashing in
pools and satisfying their need for salt.” Are
Kirk and Ray part of this underground
elephant culture? Or are they just Asses?
Brian McCarter beat down the
Menacing Michie after taking Michie took his
role of Carbide Lamp Test Interferer too far.
Congratulations on passing your Carbide Lamp
Test and getting your membership, Brian!
Three of the four ‘04-05 officers
earned their membership cards this semester in
a successful attempt to overthrown the club's
aging government.
The four newest members: Christina
Lee, Geoff Lewis, Brian McCarter and Rob
Story finally rolled the club's membership
number into the 400's! According to crude
calculations, that is about 6.5 members voted
in every year.
Aaron Thomas and Philip Balister both
have official papers in the works! Aaron
attempting to relocate and naturalize his
Mexican bride, Zulema, before the end of the
year. Buena suerte, gringo! Philip has finally
found a good reason to become a citizen of the
United States—to vote against Dubuya.
Assuming the U.S. gov't will accept Philip, we
can all blame him if/when Bush Jr. gets
reelected. Damn Canadians!
Oh yeah. Don't
forget to vote!
