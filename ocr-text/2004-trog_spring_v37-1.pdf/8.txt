First Time in the Club
By Geoff Lewis
One fateful day, I saw a sign for a caving club while walking around campus. I had been
caving with the scouts before so I decided to stop by the meeting. That Friday night I walked in
Smyth 146, not knowing what to expect. I was met by a nice girl (Christina Lee) [ed.'s note: the
author exercised his free will for all descriptive passages] and she told me about the club and how to
get on trips. Then 7:00 pm approached and I took a seat since I thought the meeting was about to
start. When it started fifteen minutes later, I knew this would be a good club for me since I am always
late to everything.
Five minutes later I sat there trying to find out what was actually going on. The meeting
appeared to be just random chaos, controlled by a laughing red-headed guy.(Mike Cole). Mailbag! An
odd-looking fellow with gigantic feet started yelling and throwing Valu packs at people like it was
candy at a parade. Accompanying this odd fellow's voice were random shouts from the rest of the
club about random stuff that I had no clue about. At this point, I realized that there was nothing
serious at all about this club and that it was exactly something I wanted to be in.
After the meeting I hung around and went to a speleoseminar where I talked to a few more
people. A seemingly nice guy, Chris Michie, said he would take a group of us caving the next
morning. We agreed to wait for Chris at Burger King at 8 AM. For an hour, we sat at Burger King.
We were thinking about leaving when a knight on a white stallion showed up. We stuffed ourselves
into the Mustang and then rode to Sign Out. Later we found out Chris had overslept and it was not
the first time either. The trip turned out to be a blast and the club has been fun ever since, despite .
those first shocking experiences.
