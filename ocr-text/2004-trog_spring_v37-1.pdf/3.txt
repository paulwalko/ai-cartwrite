Falling in Caves: A Guide to Style
By Cameron Keyes
Falling down is something that any
seasoned caver faces while underground. It is
important to remember a few basic rules in such
an event; doing so can help you preserve your body
as well as save face.
The first rule to remember is to avoid falling
down entirely: know your own
limits so that you don't
overextend yourself. If you are
unsure about an area you need
to chimney up, have someone
else go first. This is good
advice from a safety
standpoint, but much more
importantly it allows you to
remain looking calm, cool, and
in control. If that ledge is going
to fall, then by god somebody
else is going to figure that out
before you do. If someone else
goes up first and does fine, then
it's ok for you. If they fall, then
they're the ones who look silly
and not you. Your style, class,
and caving ego are all safely
intact.
The second rule of style is to cave in close
proximity to other cavers. While some will tell
you this is so that if you fall there is someone nearby
to help you, those people are as un-cool as recently
used baby diapers. The real reason you cave near
others is so that if you fall you can take them down
with you. Sure, you look silly lying there on the
ground covered in mud – but then again so does
the guy beside you, and the girl beside him...oh
and that other fellow over there. In the
proceeding confusion it will be easy to blame that
first fateful slip on someone else.
The final, and by far most
important rule, is to always,
ALWAYS, cave with a trainee.
This rule is useful in the direst
of circumstances, when you fall
in a wholly unstylish manner, far,
far away from other cayers.
Here rules one and two fail you
because no one could go before
you to test out the ground, and
there is no one to trip in order
to distract the group from your
cave-fashion faux pas. Someone
who is inexperienced in the art
of chilled out caving might panic
in a situation like this. They
might even be foolish enough to
say something like “Ouch.” But
this is where your many years of
coolness have time to shine. As
you fall tumbling down the rock wall you had
been so deftly climbing a moment ago remember
to stand up slowly and calmly, brush yourself off,
and shout “That was YOUR fault, you damn
trainee. Now grab that 900 feet of rope and let's
get going. Tawney's is a big cave.”
