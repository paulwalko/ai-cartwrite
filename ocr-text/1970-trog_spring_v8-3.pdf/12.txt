And so, after an elapsed time of six hours in the cave, we
left, reassured that with our newly acquired knowledge, the
next mapping trip to Newcastle would be smoothly run, effic-
iently organized, and absolutely without confusion (HA HA HA ).

CAVING IN ARIZONA'S HUA CHUCA MOUNTAINS ..
While on a recent caving trip through the southwest, I.

So, armed with Topos and advise, Winston Harmon, Fred

over Montezuma Pass to the junction of Ida and Cave Canyons in
the Huachucas, . Here we would have to leave the car, and go on

Sutherland Peak Cave, Ida Canyon Cave, and Happy Jacks Cave.
Sutherland Peak Cave is at the base of Sutherland Peak near
the entrance to Ida Canyon. The entrance is a climbable vert-
