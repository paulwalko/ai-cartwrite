SKYDUSKY HOLLOW SYSTEM
PRELIMINARY REPORT
It seems odd to be writing a preliminary report on a
system which has been known of for as long as the Skydusky
Hollow System. Yet this system is conceptually quite new.
old timers would better recognize it as the Newberry Banes
system. Continual exploration and survey however has proved
that in all probability Newberry Banes is just part of a much
larger system which has become known as the Skydusky Hollow
System.
Skydusky Hollow is located in Bland County, a rather
rugged county in the Appalachian Mountains of southwestern
Virginia, The hollow is bounded to the south by Big Walker
Mountain and to the north by a secondary ridge of Big Walker,
While there is no surface drainage in the hollow, Big Walker
Creek flows parallel to it, to the north of the secondary
ridge.

The major caves of Skydusky Hollow occur at the base of
Big. Walker. Mountain with the entrances at the base of the
Martinsburg formation; shale and sandstone sedimentary rocks
of the Middle Ordivician age. This formation acts as a cover
for the caves to protect them from sediment and erosion.
The upper sections of the caves are complicated mazes with
little sedimentary deposits. In all cases the upper sections
are connected with the lower sections by drops ranging from
73 to 190 feet, The lower sections are quite diffuse in
character with large rooms, running passages, high domes, wet
grimy crawls, and muddy canyons
In the 1700's these caves attracted little attention, The
cool, dependable streans flowing down out of the mountain
attracted the settlers. These streans reached the contact
between the shale and sandstone and the limestone and "disap-
peared" into the goound. The settlers located near the contact
to capitalize on both the fertile limestone soil and the
