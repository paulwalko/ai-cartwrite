LONG DISTANCE CAVING
Within the few thousand American cavers there are basic-
ally two groups, one group caves to further the knowledge of
a particular cave or system by mapping or studying the various
scientific aspects of the cave. The other group consists of
what are called "sport cavers" whose chief reason for caving
lies in the adventure of seeing the cave at their leisure, A
sport caver will quite frequently pick out the more popular
caves to visit just to say he's been there. The sport caver
is usually not content to cave in just one area for caves of
one type can become boring. Hence the desire to spread out and
see caves in other areas quite often governs the behavior of
sport cavers,
Since popular caves are found in many different places
and usually satisfy the need to see caves in other areas, it's
not unusual to find the sport caver on the road, This brings
us to the subject of long distance caving, which for purposes
of this article will be defined as caving in areas requiring
a trip time of two or more days. (Not a single over-nighter)
Besides the reasons for long distance caving already
mentioned, there are other reasons immediately obvious:
1. Opportunity to meet other cavers.
2. Flexibility offered in a long trip - not having to be out
: of a cave by a particular time in order to "get back",
3. Fulfillment of the camping urge that most cavers have,
4. Very inexpensive compared to other vacations,
There are a number of different ways to go on a.. long
distance caving trip. One way probably chosen by most sport
cavers is to arrange some kind of rough itinerary ahead of
time indicating which caves will be visited and a rough idea
of when. This should be done well in advance of the trip.
With the itinerary in mind a number of things can then be done
to make the trip flow smoother:
1.
Write or phone cavers in the areas of the caves you wish
Write
to visit to find out what the present status of the cave
is. These people will also be able to give you some tips
on the equipment you may need to explore the cave, Prob-
ably one of the most valuable aids from the local cavers
is their tips on the idiosyncrasies of the cave owner -
the right and wrong ways to ask his permission, etc,
Directions to a cave in a foreign area may be long and
drawn out (especially out west). What may seem obvious
to the local caver may not be so obvious to you, and may
result in a wrong turn placing you on the wrong ridge,
