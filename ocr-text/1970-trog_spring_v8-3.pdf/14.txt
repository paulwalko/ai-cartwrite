As I have said, caves in this area are very well decorated
and for this reason locations are kept in confidenceAn old
prospector-caretaker at the D'Albini Ranch in Ida Canyon is a
most valuable source of directions to the caves in the nearby
canyons, Unless you own a 4x4, all the caves require a good
deal of hiking in rough terrain; rather uncommon to Virginia
cavers, Hiking around as the gh; can be dangerous in some areas
due to open mine shafts S7:18. ülose to the paths. Likewise,
during the day in temperatures abouve 75°F one would do well
to watch for the unfriendly rattler, especially near cave
entrances, with the number of caves (some vertical) that the
old prospector described, it seems that a few cavers with some
time on their hands could have a real blast in the Huachucas -

THE DEVIL AT AIRPORT ROAD
(To the tune of "Thunder fioad")
I can tell a story, I can tell it right,
About the VP Cave Club, and their meeting Friday night,
Moose he chaired the business, Lynn she took the notes,
Doug inducted trainees, and Mike helped to count the votes.
Sometimes they would argue, sometimes they would fight,
Owners got their valentines, so they wouldn't get up tight,
Trip reports were given, as they told about some pit,
Sometimes when they were lucky, then the LA gave a skit,
CHORUS:
And there was singing, singing, over Airport Road,
Caving was their pastime, they were adventurous and bold,
And there was caving, caving, it worked up quite a thirst,
The Lord he swore he'd get them, but the devil got them
first.
8:30 in the evening, it was on a Friday night,
The business was all finished, and a party was in sight,
The caver's grabbed their guitars, harmonicas and booze,
And hit YMCA MS, with no time left to lose.
Starting out with "Rider", and right on down the list,
They sang out every song they knew, and then the few they'd
missed,
They finally came to "Falcon", and "Charlotte" sounded swell,
The "Friggin' Wheel" burst into flames, they were singing bent
for Hell;
CHORUS
