BUILD YOUR OWN SHORTY WET SUIT
This article is not meant to give a step by step method
of building a shorty wet suit, but rather the way I did mine,
and some things I found out,
There are two kinds of wet suits: one a complete suit
which covers the whole body, consisting of pants, top, boots,
gloves, and hood; the other is a "shorty" or tunic, Wet
suits are made of foam neoprene and they keep one warm with
the initial water leakage.
. I built a shorty because it was easier; it required less
work and material. Also building ones own wet suit is more
economical. A store bought shorty costs around $30, and
mine cost only about $14, Cost can vary depending on the cost
of neoprene, Besides these reasons, I wanted a shorty because
it is less cumbersome, it does not retard body movement while
climbing.
.. The building of a wet suit requires basically the use of
a razor blade and cement and a few basic patterns. Material
for the suit is a half sheet of neoprene; Sheets of neoprene
can be hard to get unless you order. If you order you will
pay for it. Contact some SCUBA Divers and they should be
able to help you get it elsewhere. Of the three choices of
thickness (1/8", 3/16", 1/4") I chose the 3/16". Other.
materials used included: neoprene cement, new single edge
razor blades, and a' two inch strip of velcro to substitute
for a zipper, -, Velcro works fine, m√ºd will not get on it
because it is inside the suit. Also all zippers must be put
in very accurately.
