SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1970
To begin: Take a T-shirt that fits snug (be careful
not, to stretch it), cut the sleeves off and cut from the neck
along the top shoulder seans to the sleeves, Then cut down
the front where you want the opening. Lay the pattern down on
the inside of the sheet and mark off the three inches from
the right side and at least Å¾ inch from the top of the neck,
(SEE FIGURE #1 ) .
With chalk mark off the boundaries and remove the pattern,
cut along the marked lines. Lay on the sheet with own arm-
pits where the armpits are on the sheet and mark off the crotch
and also mark just above the knees and cuti
Important cutting note: For finish cuts like the legs,
cut perpendicular to the sheet; for cuts that are to be glued,
cut at an acute angle for more gluing surface. Be sure that
the cut surfaces match,
Now glue the shoulders together, Put on three thin, even
coats on each side, wait until tacky, and then press firm and
knead the edges,
Proceed to the bottom, cut a narrow "V" in the crotch and
measure the circumference of your legs. Lay on the material,
check the measurement by the material to make sure it is large
enough. (SEE FIGURE, #2)
Make a point of opening (SEE FIGURE #2) about 18 inches
from the neck on the front and cut the front center lines from
the bottom to this point. The front center line seam should
be a good fit, but remember that side alterations will be
needed later,
Put the suit on and do some deep knee bends. The crotch
(SEE FIGURE #3) will rip some, so be careful. On my suit I
cut out a 2" X 6" rectangle and glued it in the crotch,
Next, the legs need to be taken in,. Do this by pinch-.
ing the material in the loose parts with one hand and mark
with chalk with the other. Then draw in a "V" and cut and
glue. (DOUBLE CHECK BEFORE GLUING)
The chest area may be too: large, so glue the pile side
of the velcro on the left and the hook side on the right, (so
the hooks don't touch you)
With this done, repeat the procedure of final adjustment
of the shoulders, (SEE FIGURE #3) The shoulders, legs, and
velcro should now be fixed,
Now pinch in both sides at the same time and mark, (this
requires a second person), cut and glue. Repeat until tight
enough, "(SEE FIGURE #4)
