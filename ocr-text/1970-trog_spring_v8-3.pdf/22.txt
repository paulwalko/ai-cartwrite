THE TECH TROGLODYTE

fact we went back in and tied in the sinkhole entrance. In
the room with the petre dirt mounds we climbed up and mapped
a small maze section, Chimneying up 10 feet we found another
passage and mapped it. Back in this area several small
dome pits were found. In one the walls were found to be coated
with fossilized shells most of which were pure white. These
fossils are only connected by slivers of limestone and any
movement is apt to knock them off.
We then decided that we had better leave the lower section
and the basement room for the next mapping trip. We emerged
after eight hours with 1400 feet mapped,
On October 4, 1969 I finally departed again, this time
with Dennis McClevey, Mike Conefrey and Jim Talmadge.
Having been in the lower section once before I knew of the
several hundred feet of water crawls that awaited us. At.
the cave entrance the hapless victims of my folly were in-
formed of this fact.
Entering by entrance two we were getting ready to start
mapping the basement room which is midway between entrance two
and entrance three, when we heard voices outside the cave
getting ready to come in. So we decided to wait around and
see who it was, Three rugged males and three females of the
species, from Tech and Radford respectively, then appeared.
Each was magnificently equiped for caving. They were dressed
in street clothes and there were five flashlights between them.
As they stood watching us, one of them ventured a
cautious hello not knowing exactly what we were. They were
quite relieved to find us, human??? First they complimented us
on our unique light sources, carbide lamps, Eventually we
decided to get on with the mapping. Thinking we were guides
the girls started to follow us. They soon stopped with a
shriek asking if they had to go through THAT, I couldn't see
why not, the passage down to the basement room must be at
least two feet wide and a foot high,
Probably thinking we were not really human they departed
to the dryer sections of the cave. We mapped the basement room
and back out the stream, Hearing their voices at the other
end of the stream we hurridly mapped out of it einer in through
a passage with nine inches of air space, when some of the
water on us began to drip off onto them they became convinced
we were not human after all and hurridly left the cave,
My crew then headed toward the lower section. Upon
reaching the entrance to it I explained to my fellow mappers
That : prior to 1959 this had been a fairly roomy passage
but that an earthquake had reduced it's size to a nine by
twenty-four inch crawl through unstable breakdown, . pon hearing
this there was some grumbling in the ranks and a few threats
of mutiny, which were dealt with accordingly. . .
