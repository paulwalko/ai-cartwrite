dissipated so it's use is restricted to manila rope,
also heavy and bulky and a single use item.
It is
SLIDE LOCK (the handy dandy 4 speed rappel device)
It is being made by the Rose Manufacturing Co., N.J.,
but it is not as yet commercially available. It is a combi-
nation carabiner wrap and breaking device. The rope is
wrappe," around the carabiner then passed between two plates,
The person's weight forces the plates closed, thus stopping
him, The gate opening is controlled by a lever,
Advantages: It is a foolproof method of rappeling. It
can be ji med only one way. If you should lose control of the
rope you automatically stop due to your weight. It can be used
on any length pit. No belay is needed. In the event of an
emergency two can be used to go up a rope,
Disadvantages: As of the present time it is expensive,
$14.50. It is quite bulky being almost 12" long. Because it
is a carabiner wrap device there will be fiber damage to the
rope, on layed rope there will be spinning and kinking. It
unlays rope more that the cylinder but less than a straight
carabiner wrap,
CYLINDER
This is a super carabiner wrap. It is controlled by
both hands between the legs. The amount of friction is
varied by the number of wraps. It is constructed by welding
two carabiners into a hollow steel pipe.
Advantages: It is inexpensive to build, It gives
greater friction than a double break-bar rig. The amount of
friction can be varied over a considerable range. It can be
belayed from the bottom. It minimizes damage typical of
biner wraps and can be rigged only one way.
Disadvantages: On a layed rope it will follow the lay
thereby causing excessive spinning. It is bulky, being
almost a foot long. Beyond drops of 300 feet rope weight
will cause difficulties.
HAMMER
This is another inodified spool device, It can be con-
structed by welding a two inch pipe in a. "T" fashion; phlanges
can be welded on the ends to aid in keeping the rope on,
It is controlled on the leg in double breke--bar fashion.
Advantages:. It is reletively inexpensive to build.
The rappel is smooth, quiet and easily controlled. There
is little or no spin and it can be rigged only one way.
Disadvantages: It is bulky and the weight of the steel
is excessive, Being made of steel heat loss is slow. On
drops of more than 300 feet rope weight causes difficulties,
It is possible to become derigged on rappel if one is not
careful. It is a single use device,
