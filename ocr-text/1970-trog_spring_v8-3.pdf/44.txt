These problems can be avoided by obtaining topographic
maps of the intended areas and plotting the cave location
from reliable coordinates. Experienced long distance
cavers will be the first to attest to the tremendous
amount of saved time afforded by this method.
Now that you have the cave plotted on an up to date topo
map, look closely at the map to see what kind of roads .
(if there are any!) go near the cave. You may find that
your low slung American car is only going to get within
three miles of the cave. How far and how high you have
to haul yourselves and all that equipment may be a deter-
mining factor in whether or not you want to see the cave,
Quite often more time is spent getting to the cave than .
is spent inside. Needless to say, much can be told from
a topo may.
4.
Make a complete list of necessary equipment for all the
caves you plan on visiting. There is nothing so discon-
certing on a long distance cave trip than arriving at the
care entrance (aiter a tree mile uphill hike?) and
finding that you can't find that one necessary piece of
equipment, of course, the list is no good unless you
make sure the listed equipment gets into the car.
5.
Make sure the equipment is in good shape. A few VPI long
distance cavers can recall a certain bolt driver missing
its stud.Spare lamp parts, swiss seats, batteries, are
always a good idea.
Now that you are fairly sure of what caves are on the
schedule, and the necessary equipment as well as the hiking and
time involved, you are prepared to tackle the human logistics.
These, of course, are eating, sleeping, and keeping clean
enough to ride in the same car with two or three other people,
One of the major concerns will be keeping 12. cost of the log-
istics to a mini inim,
From the cost viewpoint eating can be of the most concern.
It is the opinion of the author that a trip should not be
started without a good idea of the nenu to be followed. From
the standpoint of money and time, it's very advantageous to
have the members of the trip go together on the food. The
advantages inherent in this method are many:
1. Use of usually only one stove, as compared to two or
three stoves,
2:
Saving on stove fuel.
One person will not be taking two hours to fix a meal
while another takes an hour - everyone will eat at the
same time, ...
