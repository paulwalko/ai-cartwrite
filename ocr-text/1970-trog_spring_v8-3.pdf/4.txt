SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1970
PRESIDENT'S COLUMN
Each year, along with the Spring monsoons, the Cave Club
goes through a period of stormy weather. The club's rough
seas seem to threaten the water-tightness of our little match-
box, but somehow the storm settles and we come up a little wet
but still intact and maybe better for the whole deal. The
Constitution, by-laws, and club policies are strained, if not
- broken. The outcome of this period is usually a re-formula-
tion of these governing criteria, all in the club's best
interests.
Our Constitution was written with the explicit purpose
of giving us some guidelines and at the same time, giving the
club the lee-way it has always wanted in the past, A Constitu-
tion that is too strict is detrimental to the organization,
while one that is too lax can have the same effect; A Consti-
tutional Committee has been revived with it's purpose being to
dissect and then revitalize this document, ' Proposed changes,
that are intended to improve our constitution, should be com-
ing up for approval in the next few weeks. I want to urge
every member of this organization to take a good look at
these proposed changes, with a couple of thoughts in mind:
(1)Are they absolutely necessary? and (2)Will these changes
restrict our organization too much?
The Cave Club has been run with a pretty loose hand in
the past years. The Constitution that we've had does have
some tremendous' loopholes, but also permits some very liberal
interpretations. In this past election a controversy was
raised over the eligibility of a candidate for office, 1.e, -
was he a legitimate candidate if he was an inactive member?
The Constitution mentions nothing about this type of situation
which I think is a terrible mistake, but afterall, the authors
were only human. There are several places in the Constitu-
tion similar to this one; some were left open by mistake and
others were not explicitly defined because an organization
like ours needs some lee-way in its parliamentary procedures.
The Constitution has been broken on previous occasions -
maybe it should have occured, maybe not, depending on what
was best for the club at the time or the infraction. The
Constitution's purpose is to provide us with a guideline,
not an ultimatum, Rouember this whan you consider Constitu-
tional revisions, for once you have set a precedent, it becomes
increasingly easier to break the foundation of our organiza-
tion. If your Constitution is too strict you will end up
breaking it over and over again; if you don;t continually
break it, then at best you will continually revise it to
meet the situations that arise, and that is just as bad.
I would like to recall a story that I heard that is very
similar to this one. It concerns two.cavers; one caver went
caving with essentials: carbide, water, spare parts, and a
few necessities. The other caver was a one man expedition:
