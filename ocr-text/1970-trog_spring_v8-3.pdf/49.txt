We are the cavers who survey the passage,
Reading our bruntons, never seeing the sun,
Living on jerky and drinking cheap wine;
Cracking our heads till the big map is done,
We are the cavers who survey the passage,
Reading our bruntons, never seeing the sun,
Setting belay bolts and wading the pools,
Cracking our heads till the big map is done.
So it's over the breakdown and crawl through batshit,
Into the siphon and into the pit,
Up the main drag and around all the bends,
Reading and taping all the way to the end.
Reading 'em out and writing 'em down,
Away to the dorm and into the town,
Some oil for my boots and a shot for my head,
A drink to the living, a toast to the dead,
oh, the song of the future has been sung,
All the battles have been won,
In the deepest pits we stand,
All of hell at our command,
We have mapped beneath the soil,
With our teardrops and our toil.
Oh, there was a time in this fair land when the sinkholes
were not plumbed,
When wild, unbanded bats flew alone against the sun,
Long before manila rope and boots with nails of steel,
When the dark stalagmite forests were too distant to be
real,
When the dark stalagmite forests were too distant to be
real,
But still there's many a passageway, too distant to be
real.
