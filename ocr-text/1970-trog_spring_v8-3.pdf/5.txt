ten pounds of carbide, two gallons of water, a sleeping bag,
Coleman stove, 200 feet of rope, etc,... The first caver,
(carrying about three pounds of equipment) went running up
a particularly steep hill to a well known cave, stayed in for
eight hours, came back to town, and partied for another four
hours. The second caver, (carrying 100 pounds of equipment)
with great perseverance started up the hill to the same cave
that the first explorer went to. However, the second caver
did not cave for eight hours, nor did he party for four
hours, He had heart failure before he even reached the
entr√°nce. Remember that when you vote on constitutional

What are the female's reasons for being a caver? I'll
admit, this will be a slightly prejudiced answer - afterall,
I am a female caver, but I'm willing to bet that the largest

Since not all girls are alike (thank goodness), there
are a few adventurous spirits who "want to try everything
once". When a girl of this type hears about caving she
immediately decides it sounds like fun.' So she attends a Cave
Club meeting and party and finds herself surrounded by - (are
you ready for this?) - MEN! I But these aren't any ordinary
men. These are men with straggly beards, long sideburns, blue
denim jackets, and muddy Viet Nam boots. Her mind is
completely boggled by their coarse language and obscene
gestures, Most girls. would be completely grossed out by these
"immature and immoral deviants". But what does a future
female caver do? She mixes right in, oozes all over with
affection (as a direct consequence of their attentions to her)
and gets on a caving trip scheduled for the very next morning.
So the very next morning finds her in some nearby cave of
basic "my first cave" reputation with a ratio of at least
