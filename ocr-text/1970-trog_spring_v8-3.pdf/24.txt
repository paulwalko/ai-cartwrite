SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1970-
17
We started mapping here and were soon in a passare
three feet high. We soon reached the stream in the lower
section, this one requiring us to become totally wet,
Soon after entering the water one of the more intelligent
of the group mentioned that the family jewels were wet.
Realizing that he was a novice caver, I informed the poor
soul that these were living formations as opposed to dead
ones. With this straightened out we continued mapping.
Next we entered the Emerald Room, Under several
bright carbide lamps the room is beautiful, . In the center
of the room is a three foot: deep crystal clear pool that
continues under the floor. . To the left are forinations ann).
orystal clear soda straws. Off to the right is a little
room with a deeper pool. Here the walls are profusely
lined with fossils:
After admiring the room for several minutes we mapped
rut the 200 foot crawl and upon reaching its end Jim
yelled back "the damn thing ends" upon which we hurridly
moved our posteriors toward the entrance in remarkable time.
The total time in the cave was five and a half hours and
we mapped 800 feet;
The map is now completed. There was a total of 110
stations set and the distance was 3980 feet. And so
endeth my tale.
