NEWCASTLE "NEW SECTION"
Remember Fall Club Project? Fond memories are brought
forth merely by the mention of Newcastle Murder Hole, Those
who didn't make it that time missed Doug Draves crank-starting
his car and also that wonderful wait. outside the sinkhole...
while Moose and Paul Broughton debated on how to rig the drop
(while the water in our lamps froze). But most of all, they
nissed the God-awful confusion that resulted when a bunch of
fools tried to map a cave 'they'd never been in before.
In order to remedy the situation, the next weekend Doug
Draves, Steve Hall, Don Davison, and myself set out to explore
Newcastle Murder Hole,
We got to the cave shortly before noon, greatly aided by
having permission to drive to the sinkhole. After changing.

I would estimate 500 feet or more of passage in this upper
section, some of which was virgin beyond a doubt. We pushed
all the leads and found that several ended in small, high rooms,

under some of those sinkholes that dot the fields around the
cave,
The only other interesting event occured while we were
resting from our labors, I noticed this plunks plunki plunki
on my hardhat, so, logically, I looked around (and up) to see
where the water was coming from, Looking up at the slope
