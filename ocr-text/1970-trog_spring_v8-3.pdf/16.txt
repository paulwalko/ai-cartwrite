SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1970
sandy floor, Whitt thought telling dirty jokes was a good
idea. After much deliberation we decided to map without a
tape,
After mapping about six hundred feet we came to a con-
nection between the upper and lower passages, Russ chimneyed
down the fissure in the floor and set a permanent station for
them to tie into. While down there Russ heard the other crew
coming.
Whitt decided this trip needed some humor, so he sent a
message down for Russ to place on the station. The message
said that we had quit mapping and would meet them at some
restaurant in Bristol, Russ chimneyed back up and we turned
our lights away from the crack. There was a loud stream on
the lower level so we could hear them without them hearing us,
While quietly waiting for them, we heard a sudden loud
crash. "Must be Broughton falling", remarked Russ and I. . In
about two seconds Paul's voice rang loud and clear. After
Paul recovered they continued mapping to the note.
Upon discovering and reading the note Broughton became
rather upset. "Those bastards,"he shouted, "they left and now
we'll have to tape their passage, Boyi am I pissed!" It was
five minutes before he discovered us and the message on the
other side of the note. I don't think he'll ever forgive us,
... After this episode we finished mapping the loop and
checked out a couple of leads. They went but we decided to
leave. We mapped a total of twenty-two hundred feet and
Vicker's Cave is now around eight thousand feet long.
Whitt, Annie, Paul, and Tom went out the way we came in,
but Russ, Pete, Bill, and I went out the water entrance. The
few thousand feet we went through was practically all high
fissure with the stream in the bottom, There was a lot of
chimneying and climbing and we got out of the cave in seven
and one half hours after entering.

Dame; OK, but does it work?
