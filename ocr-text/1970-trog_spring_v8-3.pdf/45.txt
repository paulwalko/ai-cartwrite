Not as many dirty dishes and pots, therefore saving
cleaning time,
Wider variety of meals.
Opportunity to spread the cooking and cleaning chores
among the group.
Less space will be needed to store stoves, utensils, and
food between meals,
Another time and space saving idea is use of paper plates
and cups at each meal. The menu for the trip will probably ..
vary a great deal with the time of the year. A good winter-
time breakfast that is also very quick in preparing is oatmeal,
This dish requires only boiling water, oats, and about ten'.
minutes time to cook, A breakfast during warmer times of the
year might be the old standby of eggs and bacon, or plain old
cold cereal, Generally speaking, a group of long distance
cavers will not want to spend a great deal of time everyday..
just preparing and eating meals, therefore the only meals that
are usually cooked are breakfast and dinner; dinner being the
greater time consumer of the two. Lunch can be very simple and
fast, A couple of sandwiches and a coke will usually suffice,
therefore requiring no clean-up and a minimum of time for prep-
aration,
Â· For most cavers dinner will probably be the most important
meal of the day. When buying the food before the trip, dinner
will take the most thought with respect to what you want to eat
and and how much it will cost, Some good items to buy for
dinner are:
1.
Instant mashed potatoes: cheap and very easy to prepare,
also quite filling,
Beef stew: the old standby when you can't think of any-
thing else.
3.
Macaroni and cheese: cheap and also easy to prepare,
goes well mixed with chili or barbecue,
4.
Applesauce (in jars): an excellent dessert, and easy
to keep cold when bought in jars.
5.
One of the many varieties of Rice-a-Roni: a little more
trouble to prepare, but well worth it,
Chili, or barbecues neither have to be kept frozen.
7.
Hot dogs and beans: What list would be complete without
these, only problem here is keeping the hot dogs in good
shape.
