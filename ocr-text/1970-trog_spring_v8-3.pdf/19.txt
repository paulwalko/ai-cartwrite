ALONE IN PENLEY'S PIT
or
.
AN INTERESTING WAY TO SPEND AN EVENING
Away, the five of us happily rode to the infamous Paul
Penley's cave on a cold February day. Everyone was telling
everyone else how crazy he was to actually want to come on
a trip to Penley's, a cave known for its nudisery, dan-
gerous pits and climbs; Ã  cave whose end has not yet been
found.
Ed Morgan, the trip leader, Mike Hogan, Pam Mohr,
Robyn Lefon and myself arrived at the cave entrance about
3:00 in the afternoon. The small opening in the ground was
icy, but still had running water rushing into it,
After making it through the entrance, we shortly
found ourselves in the "shower room", which is blessed
with continual "rainfall" from the ceiling of the sub-
terranean chamber,
Soon, we came to the first drop of consequence and
climbed down a cable ladder that we had brought along,
After more climbing, we found ourselves in the rather
spacious chamber near Hogan's Horror, Mike Hogan, for
whom the Hogan's Horror drop was named, showed me the drop.
I peered down into the haunting depths and tried to imagine
what it was like when Mike had been rappeling down the drop
of then unknown depth, and lost control for about 70 feet
before regaining control of the rope.
About two hours after we entered the cave, we came
upon the 118 foot pit that was our destination. Here, the
last group of V.P.I. cavers to come here, had left their
rope, cable ladder, hand line and cams. Somehow, the rope
had gotten caught and would not come up. Our mission, then,
was to retrieve the equipment.
Ed unsuccessfully tried knocking the rope loose with a
cable ladder, but he did manage to retrieve the cams that
were tied a few feet from the top of the rope,
Then, he decided that one of us was going to have to
descend into the pit, I volunteered,
Soon, I was crawling through the small tunnel that
ended at the edge of the pit, . I rigged in while standing
on a cable ladder, and began the brake-bar rappel, on the
rope we were to retrieve from the pit, Down-down-down into
the dark and mysterious pit, I went, with many jagced rock
forms projecting outward beneath me,. After awhile, I found
the rope was caught around three different rock projections.
After unhooking the rope and continuing the descent, I soon
