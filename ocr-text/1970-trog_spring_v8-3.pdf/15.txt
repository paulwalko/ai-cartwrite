Roaring out of Blacksburg, out on 81
They headed for the underground, when Friday fun was done,
In Broncos and VW's, wherever caving led,
Those cavers took some roads, that even angels fear to tred,
Now I have told my story, I haven't told it all,
About the VP Cave Club, who drank lots of alcohol,
They left the town at sunrise, that's all there is to say,
Hungover explorations were in store for Saturday.

VICKER'S CAVE
(washington Co., Va.)
On January 30, 1970 "Whitt" Whittemore, Annie Whittemore,
Paul Broughton, Russ Peterson, Tom Speers, Pete Schnarrs, Bill
Coreley, and I went mapping in Vicker's Cave, Washington
County, Virginia.
Vicker's Cave has three entrances. Two are dry entrances
in a sinkhole across the mountain from the parking lot. (one of
these was dug open on an earlier trip) The other has water
running out of it but is located on the face of the mountain
overlooking the parking place,
After getting permission to enter, we walked over the: -
mountain and crawled into one of the dry entrances. The pas-
sage was small and dusty for a short distance. Then at a
junction it became a slanting fissure with water running in the
botton. We followed this for a while and then took a side
passage into the section we were going to map,
We were planning to map a couple thousand feet and leave.
This included a main passage with about a thousand foot upper
level loop starting a few hundred feet up the main passage,
We then split up. Whitt, Russ, Pete and I went ahead to the
beginning of the loop and left the others the lower main
passage. We were to map until the two parties met.
After getting to the beginning of the loop we made a
startling discovery. The tape case Russ had been carrying
had no tape in it. So Russ and Whitt went back to get the
extra tape the other crew had. In a few minutes they return-
ed and told us of another startling discovery. The other crew
had no extra tape,
Then we sat down and decided what to do, Pete and I
thought sleeping was a pretty good idea; it was a nice soft,
