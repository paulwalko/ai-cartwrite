they are not promising. Total length now is somewhere around
4000 feet.
Pete Schnaars, also of VPI, has started remapping New-
berry-Banes Cave, New passage and previously unmapped pass-
age promises to yield at least three miles,
By now, if you are still with me (yawn), you must be
wondering why I chose to call this a preliminary report, Very
roughly, this is the present status of the system:
Paul Penley's
Newberry's

Banes.

Paul Penley's Cave - 4000+feet and going
Buddy Penley's Cave- 5000+feet
Newberry-Banes Cave- miles
Banes Spring
- 9000 feet
Total
32000+feet
Great! Six miles of cave! But spread out over four
caves! Four caves that are obviously one system, the Skydusky
Hollow System. It is my confidence in the system that prompts
me to call it a preliminary report, while no connections have
been found, I do feel confident that if someone is willing to
push hard enough and long enough the connections can be found.
It very well may be that blasting or digging will be needed,
Ridge walking both to the east and west should also be
productive if you consider the opportunities that were missed
the first go round. Obviously, there are caves in them there
hills, boys, just waiting for the caver who is eager and
determined enough to take them away from ole father Walker
Mountain. But it'll take hard work. He don't give 'em up
easy like, but wow, what a daughter!
