SPRING
THE TECH TROGI ODYTE
1970
Most of the major concerns of a long distance caving trip
have been covered in this article. Of course, many more tips
could be added; but the length of the article would be formid-
able. This article should give the beginning long distance
caver some idea of what is involved in a long distance caving
trip.

CAVE MAPPING TRILOGY
There was a time in this fair land when the sinkholes
were not plumbed,
When wild, unbanded bats flew alone against the, sun,
Long before manila rope and boots with nails of steel,
When the dark stalagmite forests were too distant to be
real.
But time has no beginning and history has no bounds,
As to this linestone country they came from all around,
They grobed into her sinkholes, and they walked the ridges
tall,
Made friends with cave owners for the good of us all,
And when the young man's fancy was turning in the spring,
The caving men grew restless for to hear the brakebars
sing,
Their minds were overflowing with the visions of their day,
And many a passage was found and lost, and stations marked
the way.
For they looked to the future and what did they see,
They saw cavers mapping from the fore to the lee,
Bringing the news to the hard workin'. crew,
Drawing with care all that was new.
Look away, said they, across this karst-filled land,
At the caves that dot the Eastern limestone band.
Bring in the mappers and set up base camp,
Set a hundred stations with a carbide lamp,
Open your heart, let the lifeblood flow,
We gotta get on our way 'cause we're mapping too slow,
We gotta get on our way 'cause we're mapping too slow.
Behind the wide Blue Ridge, the sun is declining,
Stars, they come stealing at the close of the day,
Across the wide valleys, our loved one's Å¿ie sleeping,
Beyond the cold rock, in a place far away.
