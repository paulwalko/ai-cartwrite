WHALE TAIL
This is an adjustable friction device made from a block
of aluminum 2" x 1" x 10". Notches in the side are designed
to keep the rope. in.
Advantages: Friction can be varied by adding or sub-
tracting notches. It is compact and keeps the rope straight.
It has high heat sink capabilities. There is no way of becoming
derigged while on the rope. Can be used on any length drop,
Disadvantages: No disadvatages have been brought to
my attention,
LLIR LES CEDING HOOK (death hook)
Sold by Matterhorn, manufactured by Pierre Allain; It.
is a specially bent piece of metal in principle like a spool.
Advantages: It is shaped so that the rope wraps are
kept separate, It is lightweight easily rigged and con-
trolled on the leg or with both hands between the legs. It
can be rigged in only one way.
Disadvantages: Exaggerates rope kinking on layed rope,
on braided it twists the inner cord which can cause bumps on
the inside. Tension is required to keep the rope rigged. It
is possible to become derigged while rappeling. It can be
used on drops of up to 300 feet and is a one use item,
SPOOL
This is the original spool type device. It can be used
on any type of rope. It is for use on drops of less than
400 feet,
Advantages: It has a hich friction capacity. It does
not unlay the rope so it shows no spinning. It is controlled
with both hands between the legs. Being made of steel it
shows no wear.
Disadvantages! It is bulky and heavy. It is difficult
and expensive to make. The steel dissipates the heat slowly.
Beyond 400 feet rope weight is a friction factor.
RACK
Designed by the Huntsville grotto. It can be used on
any type of rope, Friction is controlled by the adding or
subtracting of trake-bars.
Advantages can be used on drops of up to 1000 feet.
It will not spin or put kinks in the rope, It is relatively
inexpensive. The aluminum brake-bars dissipate the heat
easily. Can be belayed from the bottom. Worn parts are
easily replaced.
Disadvantages: Care must be taken not to rig in
backwards. It is heavy and bulky.
