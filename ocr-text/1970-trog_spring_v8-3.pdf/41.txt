thought, Pushing through a small crawl, a dry maze area was
discovered. Disappointingly though, it was moving further
away from, not closer to Newberry-Banes. However, one rather
insignificant crawl opened into a passage that eventually
looped around the maze and headed directly toward the extreme
eastern end of Banes. Hopes for a connection rose then ended
just 120 feet short of Banes! But a third extensive cave, now
having grown to 8000 feet, had been added to the area.
It had become obvious that Newberry-Banes was just part
of a much larger system, the Banes Spring-Banes-Newberry-
Penley System. Thus was born the concept of the Skydusky
Hollow System,
Efforts were again turned toward Penley's Cave. Lead by
the dauntless author of this report, the upper maze section of
Penley's was mapped. The naze, on three interconnecting levels,
contained half a mile of passage in an area of approximately
one acre! Exploration of the lower lever, reached by a 100
foot drop and a 30 foot drop, revealed another half mile of
cave; but still we were unable to get closer than 500 feet
from Newberry's, Pushing a very unlikely lead at the bottom
of a supposedly blind pit however produced a muddy, wet crawl,
heading straight for the western end of Newberry's! Again hope
for a connection soared, only to be stopped 250 feet short of
Newberry's!
With hope din for a connection with Newberry-Banes from
Buddy Penley's Cave, we decided to check Paul Penley's Cave.
Although Caves of Virginia gave a rather brief description of
a cave of about 300 feet and although it was at least 1500
feet from the western extreme of Newberry Cave, we apparently
had nowhere else to look,
While the main passage was a large canyon stream, it
terminated after 150 feet. However, a high lead in wet, un-
stable breakdown near the entrance yielded a wet, unstable
naze section in the general direction of Newberry's Cave,
While total length of the maze approaches 2000 feet, actual
straight line distance toward Newberry's probably does not
exceed 400 feetA lead of the izaze section yielded another
1000 feet of large passage but not in the direction of New-
berry's, At the end of this passage we found a 160 foot pit
and a twin 118 foot pit,
We were also able to reach the 160 foot pit at the 110
foot level. We could see. an opening on the other side of the
pit 20 feet over and 15 feet lower. In desperation and fool-
hardiness we lugged in a grappelling hook, With good ole VPI
ingenuity and skill (and mostly luck) we were able to reach
the other side! A 30 foot drop of that passage yielded the
largest room in the system- an estimated 150 feet wide, 300
feet long, and up to 75 feet high. Leads at the bottom of the
pits and off of the big room have not yet been checked, but
