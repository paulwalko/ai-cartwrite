THE TECH TROGLODYTE

came to a mass of entangled white line balled around the
main rope, Ed and the others, waiting above the drop,
managed to lower the main rope so that I could stand on a
small ledge and remove my brake-bar to allow the white
mass to pass through my carabiner, After swapping my
brak e-bar back in place, I pulled on the main rope to see
if the end was unhooked. It wasn't. Somehow, as I again
began my rappel, I lost control of the rope for about
10 to 15 feet and ripped the back end out of my pants on a
projecting rock. At last; I landed in the bottom of the
drop, in the "squishy" oozing riud. At the end of the rope,
I found the worse entangled mess of ladder, rope, hand line
and twine that I have ever seen,. The cable ladder, at the
end of the rope had been caught under a ledge at the very
bottem of the pit. After unsuccessfully attempting to un-
ravel the mess, I bundled it together in as compact a mess
as I could.
Ed then tried to pull up the rope with me and the
gear attached to it. This failed. Ed tried again. This
time, I held much of the rope and cable ladder wrapped
around ny right arm, tied myself to the main rope, and
began a tedious climb up the side of the pit, as Ed pulled
up the rope. I made it about 35 feet up from the bottom
when, as I was running out of hand holds, suddenly the ones
I was grasping broke away and I fell about four feet,
dangling in the air, Ed managed to lower the rope a
couple feet so I could rest on a ledge barely large enough
for me to stand on. However, he could not pull me and the
equipment up at one time. So, Ed decided to leave me down
in the pit while he pulled up the equipment. After several
attempts, the entangled equipment was finally brought to
the top of the drop. It seemed like many hours before
they managed to untangle the ropes and ladder, I was alone
and shivering from the cold on a narrow, slippery ledge,
overlooking jagged formations for a very long timeAt
last! After failing to reach me with an extended cable
ladder, Ed sent the rope down to me, I tied on my prusik
knots and started to climb up the rope, when, all at once,
my lamp light went out. As much as I tried I could not
bring down the upper, muddy prusik knot to enable me to
return to the ledge, Ed again lowered the rope so I could
stand on the ledge, I groped blindly into my pack and
somehow managed to recarbide in the blackness of the eternal
night. Soon, my lamp was working again and I began to
prusik up the rope, cold and tired, I worked my way up
the drop; yet each time I put my weight on my chest prusik
(in order to raise my foot prusik) I felt a terrible pain,
as the chest safety pulled tight around my body and cut off
my breath. Somehow, I made it to the top of the drop after
unrelinquishing effort. (I found out later that the chest
prusik I had borrowed for this caving trip, was too long
and I should not have pushed up so far with it; and I should
have connected my chest safety to my swiss seat to prevent
