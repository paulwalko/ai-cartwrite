the trip by as much as an hour (when the sun is shining).
Therefore something should be found to sleep under: trees will
sometimes work, Sheltered rest areas are another alternative,
although a state trooper may interrupt your sleep. Air mattres-
ses are imperative, Knowing the location of various caving
field houses (or cavers?) can also be a great help. One should
keep in mind that state parks and fieldhouses will charge a fee,
When all else fails, a church yard, the side of the road, or
a cave will do,
Packing of all of this stuff into your vehicle is due
tremendous consideration. If you are using the standard Amer-
ican automobile (sedan) it would be good to rent or build a
cartop carrier. The optimum carrier will have a large volume,
and will have doors opening on either side of the car. Locks
are imperative for obvious reasons, Sufficient water-proofing
is also a must since there is almost no way to keep a tarp tied
down to a carrier moving at 75 mph.
Most of the equipment is readily segregated into groups
used at different times, one side of the cartop carrier can
be used solely for sleeping gear: sleeping bags, blankets,
air mattresses, ground cloths. Onge this side of the carrier
is filled in the morning it doesn't have to be bothered with
again until evening when the gear is once again needed. On
the other side of the carrier the group can store individual
clothing packs and toiletry items. Any room in between
sleeping and personal gear can be used to store gear which will
not be used often enough to warrant ready access,
Caving gear and cooking gear, as well as food will fit
nicely into the trunk, Cardboard boxes are most useful here..
Cooking gear in one box, food in another and caving hardware
(biners, etc.) in yet another box is the best way to go, Ropes
should be put in a duffle bag and kept out of the way of other
gear, Boots, hard hats, lamps, etc, should be arranged around
the perimeter of the trunk, surrounding the food and cooking
gear (including ice chest and stove). In this manner cooking
gear doesn't have to be moved to get at caving gear and vice-
versa. A large amount of the camera gear (if present) can also
be accomodated in the trunk,
Two small, cardboard boxes inside the car are a big help.
One can serve as a file for caving literature, maps, state park
guides, letters concerning the trip, etc. Being inside the car
ins√ºres ready access. The other box can keep cameras handy
and in winter can keep battery run items warm, Severe cold
can spell death to batteries stored in the cartop carrier or
trunk, : At night when the inside of the car is no longer warm
a hand warmer placed in the box will usually keep the batteries
alive,
The complement of gear can be finished off with an ade-
quate supply of kitchen matches, wash and dry towlettes, and
pa per towels.
