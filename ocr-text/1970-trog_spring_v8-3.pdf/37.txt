THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1970
At first Frank demonstrated the banding of bats, describ-
ing to us what he was doing as he went along, Next, we were
each given a chance individually so that Frank could be sure
we were doing it correctly.
Banding bats is done best with ungloved hands. First of
all you reach up for a bat on the wall, take him off carefully,
then set him on a rock, Depending on how sleepy the bat is,
he will sooner or later begin squealing and flapping around,
trying to escape, though he can not fly on account of his body
being too cold, As well as squealing and flapping, he is
continually attempting to bite a chunk out of your hand, which,
if he succeeded could possibly lead to your getting rabies,
Tiius, after having put the bat on the rock it is best to cover
his mouth and head with one of your gloves. Anyway, after you
have set the bat on the rock you get a band, the specific
type depending on the species of the bat, Next, you spread
open one of the bat's wings carefully with one hand. With the
other hand you take the band and gently set it over the main
wing bone, Next you squeeze the band carefully, so as not to
puncture the membrane of the wing, yet just enough to keep the
band loosely on the wing. The number on the band, and the
species are recorded. Next you check to find the sex of the
bat. This is then also recorded,
After having banded a few bats individually, we gathered
several bats together and had a mass banding with one person
giving out the bands and doing the recording. After having
banded two and a half dozen bats, we headed out the back exit
with no difficulty. After climbing up to the main entrance,
the rope was being pulled up when, at about the time the rope
reached the ledge, a sudden clanking thud was heard. In other
words, the gear which had been tied onto the rope had fallen.
The rope was then pulled up the rest of the way and soon
thrown back down again, However, Frank, his friend, and the
other trainees had all left their vertical gear tied onto the
rope. I was the only one with my vertical gear, with my only
being a trainee, Frank didn't like the idea of my rappeling
down and running through the cave alone. Yet no one else could
use my gear for I only had a single brake-bar, The final
decision was soon made, I rappelled down, then tied Frank's
vertical gear to the rope which was then pulled up. Frank soon
rappelled down, the remaining gear was tied to the rope, then
we quickly went through the cave, my opening the back exit and
going out first, In the meantime, those remaining outside the
cave had pulled up the rope and gear, gone back to the car, and
begun changing. Though it was only four hours long, it was
a most worthwhile trip.
