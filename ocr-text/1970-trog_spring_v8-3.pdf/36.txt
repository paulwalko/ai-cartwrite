A SAFETY HINT
. When rappeling there is the inherent danger that one may
lose control. When this regrettable event occurs one often
finds the section of rope used to brake oneself out of sight
and wildly dancing about. It is very difficult to regrip
the rope and reassume the proper rappeling posture. Provided
one remains relatively cool-headed and doesn't attempt to .
grab the rope above the brake-bars, there is a way to easily
avoid the problem of regaining control,
If one were: to simply place a carabiner (a climbing
carabiner is most convenien on the Swiss seat so that it is
situated just below the
grand it will restrict the
rope's movement. If ons m√©s control all that one has to do
is reach for one's inner thigh and the rope will be there,
Light is not needed.
If one would place the carabiner just above the braking:
hand on the Swiss seat mich Chips same effect will be achieved
and the carabiner can also };e used as an additional brake if
so desired. When using this Ievod, one must realize that the
area of minimum rope moveme!)t is reduced,
To fasten the carabine to the Swiss seat just twist the
sling material around it as if taking up slack.
. Also note that if needed that one can make an extra brake
by using the carabiner for a 'biner wrap.

BAT BANDING IN PIG HOLE
i one weekend last January I was most fortunate to have
been able to get in on a trip to Pig HoleOn the Trip were
Frank Garrett, the leader, a friend of his, and a few trainees,
This caving expedition to Pig Hole was much different than
most for our main purpose was to band bats, making it a most .
interesting and informative trip.
After the rope was rigged in, we all rappelled the 116'
to the bottom with essentially no problems. While Frank and
his friend banded the bats in the entrance room, myself and the
others did a bit of exploration to find the section where the
most bats were located. Frank and his friend finished within
a reasonable amount of time, then tied the vertical gear to the
bottom of the rope and joined the rest of us,
