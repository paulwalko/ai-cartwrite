mountain streams, The fact that one could follow these streams
as they disappeared into caves meant little.
Increased requirements for the nitrates from saltpetre
resulted in the exploration of the easily accessible upper
sections of local caves. However, the caves in the Skydusky
Hollow System contained little saltpetre and were passed by
for the more productive caves further west in the valley such
as Tilson Saltpetre, Repass Saltpetre, and Buchanan Saltpetre
caves,
One cave in Skydusky Hollow, now closed, was used during
the Civil War to hide valuables from federal troops, and later
for storage.
But, except for curious locals, there was little interest
in those "holes in the ground" until the first part of the 1950's.
Then a group of VPI and Wytheville extension cavers began
exploration of what was considered by locals as two caves:
Banes Cave and Newberry Cave, Their exploration and subse-
quent connection of these two caves resulted in the Newberry-
Banes System, with over two miles of passage, making it, at the
time, the third largest cave in Virginia, Search of the sur-
rounding area turned up three other caves: Bane's Spring Cave
to the east and Buddy Penley Cave and Paul Penley Cave to the
west.
Bane's Spring was mapped to a total of 1750 feet and
Buddy Penley's to a length of about 2000 feet, Paul Penley's
was explored for about 300 feet.
Interest in the area apparently gave way to exploration
of other prominent caves further west. The primary interest
in the system became the sport value of the vertical nature
of the Newberry-Banes System, Bill's Rappel Canyon and the
Triple Wells offered drops of 160' and 2000 respectively.
These were especially attractive since it was possible to
climb out rather than prusik, The cave attracted cavers from
Penn,, Md., and N. Car.
In the mid-sixties interest was rekindled. Bill Cudding-
ton told Mike Hamilton of a lead in lower Buddy Penley's which
potentially night lead to a connection with Newberry-Banes.
A subsequent trip found that while the new section did not
trend toward Newberry-Banes, the cave was much more extensive
than was thought.
Interest was also re-established by John Holsinger through
his work with the Virginia Cave Survey for a supplement to
Caves of Virginia. Thus the VPI Grotto again turned its
interest back to the Newberry-Banes area.
Work by R.E.Whittemore in Bane's Cave during 1966 in
Bane's Spring revealed that it too was more extensive than was
