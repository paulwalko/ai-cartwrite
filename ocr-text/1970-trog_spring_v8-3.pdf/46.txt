Practically any of the above will be very filling, satis-
fying the hungriest caver. Since keeping things cold is always
a problem (especially in warmer climes) you should shy away
from food requiring some form of refrigeration. When food is
bought initially it would be wise to buy a limited amount of
things like bread which are crushable and can go stale quickly.
A number of stops will probably be needed to replenish supplies
of cokes, bread, peanut butter, and jelly, Cokes can offer a
major economic problem. If four people are on the trip, each
wanting a cold drink for lunch and dinner, this can run into as
much as two six-packs per day or about $1.70 worth of cold
drinks (of good size). Additional drinks at other times can
run the cost to $2.50 per day easily. This can all be avoided
by preparing a jug of kool-aid at each meal. The reduction in
cost is immediately obvious. This will afford another reduction
in cost when one considers the ice that has to be bought to
keep two six-packs cold.
All in all, a group of four should be able to eat on about
$21. per week, Equipment should include a small ice chest to
keep applesauce, hot dogs, etc, cold, a stove (a two burner
Coleman will usually do well), a number of utensils, including
one large pot and one large frying pan, Unless a number of
cars are going, the "community food" plan is a must on the basis
of space alone.
Another problem might be where to eat. If you happen to
find yourself on an interstate highway around dinner time, then
it's a safe bet that you are coming up on a "rest area" some-
time in the next 20 minutes, Rest areas are an excellent place
to prepare a meal. Some rest areas out west are equipped
especially for this purpose. They have covered picnic benches,
trash bins, electricity, and running water. Some even have
heated restrooms, offering a warm refuge to the cold caver,
In the southwest comparable rest areas may even be found on
some secondary roads.
When rest areas are not available, the side of the road
will have to do. At these times it is probably not possible
to get rid of trash or clean dirty utensils, and a number of
plastic bags will become indispensable for gathering trash and
dirty dishes. A later stop at a service station can eliminate
both problems.
This brings us to the problem of sleeping. Whenever
entering a state one should stop at the always present infor-
mation booth and pick up a brochure on the state parks. The
trip through that state can usually be planned so that you
arrive in the vicinity of a state park around each midnight,
State parks are never the same two places, so one would do
well to pick out the better facilities such as showers and
campgrounds, Unless you are sleeping in a tent, moisture can
present a big problem. Dew soaked sleeping bags will have to
be dried out in the morning before they can be stuffed, delaying
