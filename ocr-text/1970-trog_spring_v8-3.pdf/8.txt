THE CAVER'S DILEMMA
The yawning, black cavern beckons the brave,
The foolish, the curious, to the depths of
the cave
Away from the traffic and the canine's bark,
Adventure is lurking, crouched in the dark.
Down crystalline passages wonderlust calls,
Through tortuous crawlways and breakdown
strewn halls,
Across silent rivers to the bottomless pit,
I'd like it much more if I'd taken a camera,
WHY?
The mud tries to claim the soles of your shoes,
The rock leaves the scrape, the scar, and the
bruise,
And small consolation is the dim carbide light
As the black overwhelms you, darker than night.
The chill penetrates to the marrow of bone,
And the silence won't let you forget you're
alone.
You're wet and you're tired, your muscles are
sore,
And you wish you were outside in bed with some
book.
