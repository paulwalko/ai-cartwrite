will have to put in armpits. Extend your arm upward and trace.
the armpit tendons on a piece of paper, and cut out on neoprene
and glue in place. Be sure they don't pinch, Some inch wide,
1/8" thick neoprene strips are good for reinforcement,
especially along the shoulders.
To make boots: Take a sock that fits (SEE FIGURE #5), use
it as a pattern, and cut out.
Patches can be added by marking the area where you wish
to put the patch, then coat in a thin layer of glue, For
patches (especially NSS patch) the glue will seep through and
stain. So, apply the glue very thin and allow to dry and
repeat until properly coater. Then put the patch in place
and you are ready to go wet caving.
SPECIAL NOTE: It is always easier to take in than it is
to add on!
Care of the suit: Hang it on a wooden hanger, Patch all
holes and rips immediately. Wash after each wearing to avoid
fungus growth.

anical descenders. . It is constructed on the same principle
as the spool, being made of a round piece of wood and two
strips of metal,
Advantages: Being made of wood it is inexpensive to
construct, and has high friction capacity. It is easily
controlled by both hands between the legs and it can be
rigged only one wayIt is good for beginners due to the
ease of operation, also its being reassuring to grab onto,
Disadvantages: Being made of wood heat is not readily
