SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE

very inpressed with many beautiful formations which seem to
be ordinary decor in most western caves. This cave had more
than its share of helectites. One particularly beautiful
stalagmite was reminiscent of a candle holder and candle.
A rather crude. wooden sign indicated that part of the
cave had been explored only recently. Behind the sign we
found rather large, beautifully decorated rooms. I'm sure
there is more to Sutherland Peak Cave than is immediately
obvious; a good Virginia mapping crew could probably turn up
a good bit of passage there.
Farther up Ida Canyon is Ida Canyon Cave with a moderate
sized entrance, not too easily found. The entrance room
slopes down perhaps 30 feet at about a 30Â° angle. After
searching over an hour for a passage to the rest of the cave,
we finally found a very tight, winding passage leading off a
room adjoining the entrance. This tight passage led to a room
full of white formations, one of which was a beautiful white
bacon rind curtain one and a half feet wide and about five
feet long. This room appeared to be the extent of the cave,
With daylight hours dwindling, and still another cave to find,
we didn't attempt to uncover more passage in Ida Canyon Cave,
Once out of Ida Canyon Cave, we began the long walk back
down Ida Canyon and most of the way up Cave Canyon to Happy
Jacks Cave, Happy Jacks Cave is one of the worst and most
tragic cases of vandalism I have ever seen. The cave consists
of one big room 300 feet long and 100 feet wide. The height
probably ranged from 20 to 50 feet. The major feature, among
many other formations, is a 50 foot long, 30 feet high flow-
stone wall which I'm sure at one time rivaled any sight in
Arizona. However, the wall is now covered with vandalism, and
black soot deposited by fires started in the cave. The four of
us were amazed that people would go so far (literally) to van-
dalize a beautiful cave, I'm sure Happy Jacks is a prime
example of why western cavers keep cave locations confidential,
With three Arizona caves looked at, we headed back to Sierra
Vista to keep an appointment with a few six-packs of Coors.
While back in Sierra Vista, Rick Weber and I were pouring
over the Miller Peak Quad, and decided that there had to be
a cave at the head of Cave. Creek in Garden Canyon. In order
to prove ourselves correct we drove out to Garden Canyon, and
proceeded to follow the dry. bed of Cave Creek.. The creek ..
appeared to go a lot farther than indicated on the Topo. About
a half hour of vertical hiking put us right in the entrance of
a cave, just as suspected, Upon entering the small crawlway
entrance we were immediately chased out by what sounded like a
swarm of wasps-we didn't stick around to be sure,
It would be hard to believe that Arizona cavers don't
know about this cave, but when I told Tom Strong of our find he
said he hadn't heard of it. Possibly we found a virgin cave-
although not likely.
