to much pressure on my chest, What a painful way to learn!)
Boy! I was glad to be out of the pit. It had been about
three and a half to four hours since I had first entered the
pit,
Ed began to pull up the rope, when to our dismay, the
rope refused to budge any further! Since I was to tired to
go back down, Ed descended a rope and ladder rig and found
that a knot on the end of the rope had caught between a
small crevice in a rock. After considerable effort, Ed
returned to the top and we gloriously pulled up the rope,
gathered all the equipment and headed back out of the cave.
It was about 12:30 AM, before we exited the cave into the
cold, dark night. After changing clothes, we returned
from one of the most memorable trips I have been on, mission
accomplished.

ONE DAY WHILE MAPPING ??
Tawney's (Tony's) cave in Giles County, Va., was formed
by the erosive action of the stream that flows through the
entire upper passage and a second stream that flows through
the lower section. The joint near entrance nuinber one was
once worked for nitrate. All that remains of this operation
are mounds of dirt.
The club files have an old map of Tony's, done years ago,
Since many know passages were not on the map, Bill Park
decided to remap it. A second reason for mapping it was to
check out a computer technique for cave mapping that Bill had
developed, Enlisting my help we departed from the 'tomb-like
confines of B-burg and headed west on 460. April 15, 1969
was a beautiful day, the sun was shining in a clear sky and
the temerature read 650
We entered Tony's by entrance number two which is on the
slope on the opposite side of the road from Sinking Creek,
We started napping with Bill on brunton and myself on lead
tape and notes. We proceeded down the main passage and map-
ped 1800 feet. It was a leisurely sort of trip as we took
nine hours to do the mapping. We emerged into a clear night
and jumped into the car as our clothes were still clean,
The next day the weather was an exact duplicate of the day
before, which is a real rarity in our area, Again entering
number two we mapped out entrance number three which is 120 feet
away on the hillside. From there we tied in the stream's
resurgence in the creek, However, in the process we managed
to get ourselves dirty. After resigning ourselves to this
