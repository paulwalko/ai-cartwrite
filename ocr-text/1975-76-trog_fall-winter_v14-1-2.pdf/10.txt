once again a year nas rolled around since the last V.P.1. Grotto Banquet.
by an amazing awaunt of luck, the grotto has neither collapsed nor become really
disinterested in partying. So by general consent of all concerned, the V.P.I.
Banquet was held on Valentine's Day, February 14th. It was decent.
To start off, the parties for Friday night ranged throughout we Raper's
Ghetto: C-3, K-1, L-1 all presented happy, smiling faces of drunken bliss to the
hostile outside world. Poker playing and talking at Ed Louds, and dancing at
Denton & Redders proved to be secondary to the main singing (screeching) going
on in Jean & Bob Simond's place, Davison, Byrd, Conefrey, and others participated
in the fiasco of musical accompaniment.
The next morning people struggled awake, Jim Bearden and Carol Godla led
the assault to fix up the Blacksburg Presbyterian Church where the Banquet was to
be held. Lor Windle and others assembled the musical gear for the party. Bill
Stringfellow searched for mixers. All of a sudden...6:00 o'clock! The church
was overwhelmed with reasonably clean looking cavers. (Lord Be Praised) Everyone
sat around and overran the buffet tables at the appointed time, Shrimp, Ham, and
Beef vied with Salad and Potatoes (yummy with sour cream) for the palate's atten-
tion, an hour passed and gullet's were gored with forks of food. Finally, the
program began.
Jim "Moose" Dawson stood before the podium and proceded to awe the listeners
by numerous anecdotes that failed to allow anyone to fall asleep as usually happens
It was quick, but to the point, or lack of point, or whatever--it was good clean
Banquet fun. It was followed by the clean, good taste, etc, of the awards.
Jerry Redder and Lor Windle emcee'd the Awards. Gary Moss was renamed the
Yo-Yo for his comeback from Armchair Caver last year to an APB (Alabama Pit
Bouncer) this year. He was given a huge yo-yo with 20 ft. of Goldline, Ed
Devine was christened moose of Valhalla for a burning body rappell of Valhalla.
He was given an appropriate helmet so that he could take his place with the gods.
The Brainbucket award was given to Susanne Sutherland for trucking down a passage
where there wasn't one, just a 15 ft, fall. She scraped up what little body she
has. And the Armchair Caver went to Mike Frieders for his continuing efforts at
directing traffic. He was given a magic. erasing sheet to keep his amendments on.
Our illustrious president, Mike Wolf earned the coveted Sex award for his
lightning assessment of the situation with Spam Foiles. He was given "The Pill"
and a book on sex with pictures from a sears catalog. As a counterpoint, Don
Anderson was given Hearthrob-of-the-year in the form of a valentine with inter-
changeable names, lines, and signatures. As a derivative of the Safe Driver award,
Ed Loud was given a bumper sticker reading. "Caution--Insane Driver" for his ever
present efforts to destroy his car(s). Russ Peterson was given a party hat and
a stack of regret notices for his Party/Party pooper award. His wife picked them
up for him... he wasn't there, George Hixson regained a missing hard hat with the
names of all of the Hixson "boys" on it for his continued efforts, Doug Thompson
earned some used valves for his Toyota me the most recent of the boya.
