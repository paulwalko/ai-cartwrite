The Ice Capades
(Blacksburg, Jan, 24) Last Friday night/Saturday morning the sensational
new Pandapolis Penguins took on and defeated the 460 Seals and the Brush Mountain
Blizzards in an incredible double header display on home ice,
Starting at 9.00 pm, on Friday, the Pandapolis Penguins began their remark-
able journey by roaring over the 460 Seals with a dazzling display of control and
skill. Following this they went up and over the Brush Mountain Blizzards as they
shot over the hump and virtually coasted down to an easy victory. The Pandapolis
Penguins, now 2-0-0, are expected to face a rough line up in the future as they
take on the Newport Narwhales and the Pearisburg Polar Bears in a second back-to-
back match-up. Hopefully, there awaits the highly contested E.L.M.T. Bowl against
the undefeated Sinking Creek Snow Flurries. The Penguins will face 2 rough fight
if all their matches prove as devastating as the doubleheader on Friday was.
2 the following day with injuries ranging from
pulled muscles to hangovers. The second match, which lasted until 2.00 2.a. on
Saturday morning, proved to be the clincher as Rick Cooper, 8 tar forward, and
Chuck Shorten, star backward, met with watery fates, Ed Loud, star goalie and
drunkard, was heard to exclaim numerous times: "Whoops (thud)".
The Penguins would have faired worse in the fray had they not been bolstered
by the appearance of the Southern Conference's Don Davison, star of the Church
Hill Chapped Lips expansion team. With him was his training manager and masseuse,
Cheryl Jones, who gave vocal support and occasional physical aid. Also in atten-
dance was the Penguins temporary club. mascot, Jackson Douty, donated for use by
official bench warmer Bill Douty of the Western Conference's Princeton Popsicles.
The mascot was sent in when official mascot "Tuna" left the field early.
Head Coach Don Anderson of the Radford Arsenal Icebergs made a token appear-
ance with two of his young proteges. Several times he was heard to mutter words
of encouragement as the action became fierce. Right-wing pincer specialist,
Doug Perkins, was interviewed after the first quarter and said "They (the oppo-
nents) just don't play fair. They use over-length sticks, skate like they wore
tire chains, and beat the puck out of the puck like it was an empty beer can."
Teammate Jin Denton added: "Belch."
Missing from the Penguin line-up was such name stars as Cornhole Carter,
Strangefellow, and Arts trong (called "Armpit" by his friends and "Boy" by every-
one else). Late third quarter substitutes included Tinkerbell and "Prez" Wollie.
"All in all, one of the Penguins croaked as they slide from the ice. This was
almost as good as kickin' hippies asses!"
