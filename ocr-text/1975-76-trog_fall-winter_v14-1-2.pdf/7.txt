Fall/Winter
The Tech Troglodyte
1976
Then we rambled into October. Va.R. started us off. We co-hosted with the
New River Valley Grotto and had a wonderful time of it, bill Douty gave a tap-
dancing demonstration, Don Davison gave a vertical demonstration, Annie gave a
marvelous slide show demonstration, and mucho Cerveza gave a drinking demonstra-
tion. All in all, great fun.
Later in October, we partied again. The V.P.I. Halloween party was held at
Denton and Redder's house on Main Street. Numerous frightful features were dis-
played and several frightening visages were mercifully hiddenAlan Arab trong
got the Booby-Prize for coming as himself with an ape mask on, Mike Wolf scared
everyone by coming dressed as Lor Windle: dirty Heineken shirt and all. Things
were very frightening until Barlow showed up in his guards uniform to keep the
peace,
Everything was calm throughout November, but things again perked up the first
weekend of December when nearly a dozen cavers armed to the teeth journeyed to
Charlottsville and the first Annual V.P.I. Shoot-out. The weekend was spent with
numerous gunfire and target practice. In a six hour period over 1500 rounds of
.22's were fired. After the guns were put away, we parties,
On New Years, the cavers congregated in Richmond. Robyn Loud's father was
convinced that a good hell-raising party would be good for him. It may never be
known whether it was good or not (for him), but we loved it! The party raged for
several days with people coming in and out. Very satiating.
Terror and anticipation filled our poor hungover heads as we complained about
the pain and contemplated the next party six weeks away. Yes, for six long, hard
weeks the grotto sobered up (relatively). Then came the month of February and on
the fourteenth day, we held our banquet. The rest is history. (See the history of
the banquet in following article appropriately entitled.)
Other news of note: The V.P.I. Cave Club soundly defeated all comers in the
second Miller Pick-em-up contest, winning a color console television. We had won
a fancy stereo from the first contest victory and sold it to Bill Douty for $800!
This money has now been set aside in a seperate account (well, actually only $500
of it) for use to buy rescue equipment that we consider decent.
For those interested in hearing about the coming and going on in the club
roster, we have some words. You shall be pleased to know that old A.1. is keeping
a fira grip on most of his brood. Steve Hall drifted back into our sphere of
influence after getting lost around the world. Mike Frame and Ed Richardson care
back to us also. Ed is trying to go back to school to get his degree. mike has
drifted off again, Jean and Bob Simonds, after getting married at the end of
Spring Wuarter last year fulfilled their dream and hiked the entire Appalachian
Trail from paine to Georgia. They got their gear ripped off by some dirty s.0.8.8
while heading off the trail, but they are now back with us.
The only hold that the fates are loosening are on Thor Brecht, who has gone
to Union Carbide in West Virginia, and Jerry Redder who, with luck, will graduate
at the end of this quarter, get married, and go work with Alan Armstrong and bill
Douty in Princeton. God, what a combination.
A little more goobledegook to fill up this page is now forthcoming. Jin
Denton, Ed Devine and Chuck Shorten went to the Grand Canyon over Christmas, They
all had a wonderful time except that Ed Devine's space blanket didn't work and Jim
Denton got sick from watching Ed pick the scabs off of his ass from doing one
hell of a body rappell in Valhalla (See Banquet Article). Ed Loud is waging a
constant war with his car to see if he can scrape up enough money before he has
to scrape up his car. His escapades are numberless. Just recently, he put in
300 dollars to make his car all nice again, but found out that that wasn't any-
where near enough. His front axle is still hanging on by just one pin. A new
comer to the game of car-smearing, Lor Windle made a pitiful attempt going to
Old Timer's when his car swollowed a valve, Jerry Redder had to come save him,
At New Years, Lor tried again. He zipped into the driveway of the party-place,
pulled onto the grass and hit bill Stringfellow's car (the Mean Dick Sucker). The
interesting feature was that he hit the only other car in the field! That little
adventure cost damn near 400 green stamps. Jesus !
