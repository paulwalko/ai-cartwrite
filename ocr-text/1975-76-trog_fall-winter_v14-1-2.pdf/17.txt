Fall/Winter
The Tech Troglodyte
1976
Discovery is its own reward. Every now and then New River gives up one of
its secrets to us. The cave past Tuxedo Junction was new to all of us when we
first went there. One passage, just passed the Meat Eater, could be travelled in
two directions. While coming around it, I was startled by the sight of a devil's
head and a naked lady sculpted on the wall with bright red clay. It is now a lund
mark passed on every trip into the back. We once found a hole out of the top of
the Gypsum Roon. It led to a passage completely clear of prints. We found about
four-hundred feet of passage there,
When we reached the Terminal Siphon we felt that it couldn't end like that.
Somehow, somewhere, it had to go on. Soon after, a five man trip was arranged,
three for mapping and two to bolt up to the top of a dead waterfall. Dale, Skip
Whitehurst and myself mapped a few leads. One lead seemed not to go anywhere,
but needed mapping. We spent five hours in that lead and passed the Terminal
Siphon by about three-hundred feet! We did a climb, a crawl, through some mud
and around a corner into sewer passage. Wide, straight, tall, and further than
you could see. I ran down about four-hundred feet to make sure it was real.
Dale. What does it do?
Me: Goes about twenty-five-feet and ends.
Dale: God, you were gone a long time. Which way does it go?
Further up we found a profusely decorated passage about three-hundred-feet in
length. Most of the formations were pure white. The calcite pools covered the
floor like ice. The flowstone created terraces along the walls. All of it was
untouched, wet, and living. Fortunately, we found chimneys and crawls to get us
around it. We terminated the trip without relocating the strean.
The next trip in, Ed Devine found a climb down to the stream and more virgin
passage. We spread out for an hour to find the best way to map the section, Four
hundred feet brought us to the end of the passage. Just as we mapped up to the
end, I spotted a crawl I had missed before. That crawl led to the stream again
and more virgin passage. The stream cut back twice, making an S-turn. We got the
feeling that the cave would go on forever. That trip we turned back with no end
in sight. The cave continued as walking passage with the stream in the bottom.
Actually, the cave ends after five-hundred-feet of stream passage. The
"Last Passage is a straight shot four-feet wide and fifty-feet high. The stream
dissappears under a pile of breakdown in a room extending one-hundred-thirty-feet
above the stream. The cave seems to terminate there, at the Parrots koost.
We have reached a limit, but have left several leads to be checked and mapped.
The last trip was a long one. After leaving the terminal station, we mapped a few
side leads and headed out. Everybody was falling asleep at the periodic rest
stops. At the Meat Eater, in the Supper Room, the Gypsum Room, the Boulder Room,
and on Honeymoon Beach we had to nudge each other to initiate movement. The more
we'd sit, the colder we got. We didn't run out from the Lunch Room as we usually
do, simply because we couldn't do it. Getting out of the cave that Sunday into
the cold and windy weather was a fine thing. I was glad to get back to the World.
