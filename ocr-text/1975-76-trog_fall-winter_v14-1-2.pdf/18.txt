Plastic Garbage Bags II...The Dri-Suit
When descending or ascending within waterfalls, especially during winter or
in colder areas'. care must be taken to avoid hypothermia. The Dri-Suit 18 one
inexpensive and reusable answer to this question of survival.
Construction of a Dri-Suit requires 2 "Glad" brand plastic "Lawn Clean-Up
Bags" (2 ft. 9 in. x 3 ft. 8 in.), a pair of sharp scissors, and a roll of plas-
tic electrician's tape. One of the plastic bags should be cut along the seams,
so that two pieces of flat plastic are produced (these will be used to fashion
sleeves).
The uncut plastic bag is placed over the torso with the head in one of the
bottom corners, the other corner should be behind the back. A helmet and chin
strap are positioned on the head and a small breathing hole is promptly opened.
A smooth edged full face opening is then cut using the sc18bors. Next, the bak
is squeezed in around the neck and an arm hole is made. The bag is then removed
and the arm hole is trimmed into a smooth oval. A second symmetrically disposed
oval is cut in the opposite side of the bag, using the scissors. At this point,
the torso of the suit is completed and the addition of the sleeves is all that
remains.
The torso bag is turned inside out and the middle of the short side of a
piece of flat plastic is attached to the torso bag, 1 to 2 inches above the top
of one arm hole, using electrician's tape. The remainder of the edge of the
plastic sheet is then carefully attached around the arm hole at a distance of
1 to 2 inches. Work from the top of the arm hole down each side to the bottom
of the arm hole. An excess of material will be left at the bottom of the arm ho
hole. This is trimmed down the lenght of the sleeve and the seam of the sleeve
is produced by simply overlapping the two sides and taping them together. Do
not trim the sleeve to length. After the other sleeve is produced in an identi-
cal manner, the suit is turned right side out and the sleeves are passed through
the arm holes.
The Dri-Suit is worn beneath a long sleeved shirt and will tuck well into
your pants. Be sure to slide the suit sleeves up when putting on the shirt --
this will gather some plastic in the shoulder area and allow complete unrestrict-
ed freedom of movement. After you have put the shirt on, the sleeves may be
trimmed to length. Also, be certain that sufficient plastic is above the waist
to allow free movement in bending and twisting the torso.
The Dri-Suit may be worn during all activies: crawling, climbing, etc.
Since the face hole is rather large (a result of material gathered when the chin
strap was positioned), the hood portion of the outfit may be tucked into the
collar to produce a cooler configuration (using the face hole as a neck hole).
The hood is generally used only during actual waterfall descents, ascents, or
traverses. One must realize that the plastic does not breathe and conduct him-
self accordingly. Also, rubber bands may be placed around the wrists to exclude
water which might enter when the arm is raised. The Dri-Suit may be rolled into
a small volume and carried in of an NSS carbide dump bag for protection,
