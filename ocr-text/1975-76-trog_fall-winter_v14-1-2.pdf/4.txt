I'm sitting here in the Cowgill Library trying to think of something for a
topic in the President's Column. I could write about a controversial subject such
as Don Davison's rescue programs, or I could play it safe and write about how well
the Banquet went. Unfortunately, I find myself in the same position as Moose when
he unwittingly agreed to be the guest speaker at the banquet. There is nothing in
particular that I wish to talk about. This must not be a very good quarter for
profoundly palavering upon important subjects of no particular interest to anyone,
Sure there are plenty of problems to be discussed; some as petty as the rampant
increase in the awarding and use of certain slanderous nick-names to various mem-
bers, or as important as irresponsible designs on the use of the hard earned money
generated through the Miller contest. We all know one another well enough to say
what has to be said and anyone who wishes to speak his mind does not have much
difficulty in finding a willing audience. There are a few words I have to say on
one of the topics I was considering. This concerns what I term as the identity
crisis this grotto seems to be going through. Should we be a crack cave rescue
unit or simply exist in order to win the miller contest every quarter. We most
certainly still spend a good deal of time underground and occasionally someone
even maps a cave. However, believe it or not, there is a large number of members
out there who are actually interested in graduating from this hole and it seems
that we have become more studious as a group. Naturally, this would take some
time and interest away from the activities of the grotto, but I am sure that in
comparison with other grottos or other student groups at V.Pil., we receive one
rell of alot more input and participation from our members than they do from
theirs. I feel that what ever one wishes to do with this grotto, or for, then
do it.
Keep on Cavin'
