The Tech Troglodyte
1976
BITCH
Well, boyaboy, here we have the wonderful new Trog publication. In case
you had not noticed, we did not have a Trog last quarter and are combining the
two issues together with the simple expedient of putting two numbers on the front
cover. The reason we did not have a Trog last quarter can be summed up in one
simple little word: APATHY! There were no articles given to me last quarter and
I simply gave up, exasperated. Every article given to me was published except
for a trainee trip report that I did not think quite met with the high quality
of this journal. In other words, it was a typical article.
Wuite frankly, I am nonplussed as to how to run a business like this, I can
either take anything and everything (which from the last two quarters results
will not be that different) and just print it or I can try to limit the articles
to semi-quality stuff. The choice should be the roaders. I am willing to listen
to any and all criticism and critiques as long as you are willing to work to make
the Trog better. Until then, shut up. I will, though, listen to your attitudes
as to what kind of a Trog you would like to see (and then I'll pump you for some
help in that direction.) Basically, here are your choices. Either a high-class
technical article like this--

It should be enthusiastically apparent
that the deferent ABC places constraints
on the spiraling helical PZP in such a
manner as to cause slippage through the
lower closure 'twist of ARG. IL, though,
the twist in A IC were to be rotated in
the opposite direction at least 274
degrees, then the ARG slippage would be
found as negligible to the third decimal.
In Conclusion, then, it should be
realized that all non-sunk counter--ro-
tated helicals will core out 26 is pictured

or a more typical (of most caving magazines) trip report type like 80--
January 17th: Fred, Bill and I went caving to Dead Dog Drop. We went to
the back of the cave and came out. Fred threw up coming out.
January 22nd. Charlig George, Fred and I toured the back of Chicken House
Hole. We picked up a dixie cup as part of the conservation. I could not
find the last passage to the back. Fred threw up coming out.
January 28th: fred, Sam and I hiked the miner's trail... it was neat. We
met four other groups out there. Fred threw up coming back
January 34th: Sam, George, Charlie, Bill, Fred and I went into Crochashit
Cave, Fred was sick the entire time. Fred could not get up the drop by
himself. We threw Fred up on the way out.
Those, basically, are your choices. Either one will do for just any old
Trog, but I don't want "just any old Trog" ; I want something that people can read
on the john and not get constipated over...it's got to be good! Let me know how
you readers feel and I'll try to accomodate you. But you've got to be willing
to work to get what you want.
