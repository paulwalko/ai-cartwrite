Fall/Winter
The Tech Trecladyte

Midst the roar of the wind and the howl of the dogs comes the lilting, soft,
almost haunting refrain of times past and futures yet to come. To all you who
are sitting reading this, stop and listen. Beneath the sound of the moon cutting
across the sky, of the sun ripping through the clouds, you can hear it, Hear
the melodic tones, the gentle life-throbbing rythm of
The Grotto Grapevine
How can one start to explain the tense drama of life that is ours at the
heart of Southwest Virginia? Every issue of the Trog is a challenge to this
author to effectively render a brief explanation of the deeds done, battles won,
place in the sun--oh what fun! I shall attempt the impossible task of pouring
out the lifeblood of verbal communications and let you readers drink from a more
secure vessel than the ear provides. Hunh? you all ask. Well, Tuna to you, too.
But seriously, the club's actions are not easy to translate into words in
any manner suitable for obtaining the drama and impact as if you were actually
in the thick of the action. I shall make a noble endeavor.
As has become traditional in the Grotto Grapevine, the various and sundry
deeds of cupid have been the initial situation setters. As usual, fair venus has
again bestowed (or is it cursed?) us with the romance of the year. Mike Wolf has
fallen from the drunken disgraces of his earlier fame and has settled down to the
quiet romantic life of a pervert. The femme that he has curtailed (or vice-versa)
is named Pam (known and loved by all as "Spam") Foiles. They first became involved
at the first party of Winter Quarter at Bob Page's when they passed out in each
others arms on top of a pad on top of Mike Richardson. It has been hot passion
from there on, In a less serious manner, Tricia Vasile has also "Made the rounds"
of romantic endeavor. Her involvement being with Chuck Shorten, Dennis Vaders,
Ed Devine, Dave Bell, Mike Richardson, and me (though I can but worship her from
afar). wuite an achievement (for her, that is.)
Cupid has also been busy cementing certain relationships, Randy Wood and
Kathy Cronau finally put the hammer down and got hooked last september. Jerry
Redder and Jackie Fields are planning the bonding of bodies for April. Happy-60-
lucky Bob Alderson and Laura White have also firmed up some commitments. No dates
are known at this time,
In a similarly related field, Lynn and Jim Altman are expecting the arrival
of a "bundle of joy" (ha) in a few short months. Mitten, Ed & Robin Loud's cat,
is also expecting...repeatedly. Doug and boots Yeatts got their little caver in
late September, R.E. and Annie Whittemore picked up their own passage pusher in
a different manner--they adopted.
As long as we are on the subject of passage pushers, etc., we may as well
gaze into the magic mud glob and view the activities of A.I. Cartwright. He has
brought in three more members since last this publication came out. These folks
are Dennis Vaders, Carolyn Lewis and Susanne Sutherland (Short, but sweet). The
numbers are up to 191 now, Bob Barlow, Guy Turenne, and Mike Conefrey have made
the East River Mountain Task Force and as their main task have gated Beacon Cave.
Don Davison and Bob Barlow have worked on rescue procedures with the club both
with programs and with practice rescues. In a more sedate (non-caving) manner,
the club has established a "Special Dispensation Request Committee" to try to get
a Special Dispensation from the school to allow more freedom of action to our
associate members.
As is to be expected, along with the dynamic, stimulating caving that the
grotto does, there is also a pretty fair amount of good old down to earth Hell-
raising...Caver style. Following uld Timer's (like the next week end) we all went
down to enjoy the comfort of Rugs and Sandi Peterson's humble abode while we waited
for Randy and Kathy to tie the bonds. It was a rather sedate party, no one was
arrested and hardly anyone threw up. The wedding was a horrible thing to swelter
through while drunk, but the food afterwards was worthwhile. Seeing Tuna and
Mike Richardson in Monkey Suits as ushers was also a rare treat.
