Fall/Winter
The Tech Troglodyte
1976
Different people on the trips made them more interesting. Bob Page and Bob
Simonds would get together and quack like Donald Duck for hours, They would have
actual conversations, if you can imagine what two ducks talk about, Some people,
though, get caught in their clowning. Doug Yeatts was doing a climb without his
helmet strap on, shaking his head and laughing about a certain hand hold he could
not find. As a result, his hard hat and lamp wound up in the lower stream level,
seventy feet below!
The agonies of New River begin at Tuxedo junction and continue on in. We got
pains-in-the-ass as we went through. The snug
hole at Tuxedo Junction, the narrow crawls past, the low crawls out of the Gypsum
Room, the crawl out of the Supper Room, and the weat Eater at the end of the
Yellow Brick Road are all on our list. They aren't that horrible themselves, but
going from one to another for hours on end and facing them repeatedly over six or
seven trips makes one much too familier with them. Passing through them after
fifteen hours of caving stretches the use of imaginative explicatives.
Even some of the new discoveries have proven to be agonies, especially when
mud is involved. Once we found what we call the mud Tube. Ed Devine found it,
reported it, and let Simonds, Dale, and I map it. Ed was smart. The Mud Tube
is a passage about eighteen inches high. It looks like twelve inches, but there
is a half foot of mud. We crawled and mapped through the passage until we came
to a room where we could stand up ankle deep in mud, Bob and I were in first,
coated with mud head to foot. We soon became aware that the situation was going
to our heads. Coherent thought left us and we broke down laughing. We emerged
about an hour later, completely covered with mud,
Then there was the fifty-foot chimney I checked out. A perfect chimney down
a fissure about two feet wide. Perfect except that one wall was covered with two
inches thick nud. Miserable stuff (the mud).
Mapping small stream passage is also interesting. I'm lead tape, Calhoun is
brunton, and Dale is outside taking notes. I try to get stations straddling the
stream in passage so low that my back is on the ceiling. It goes around a corner
and Calhoun has to crawl in Checking it out requires crawling across the ceiling
to turn the corner. I cannot tell by looking Tom is smaller than me so he should
be able to check it out, but he is behind me. A few strategically placed stones,
rolling over on to a narrow bank and Tom's past. He puts stones in the stream to
lean on and hangs by his armpit on his ledge. He gets three feet further up and
decides to quit. Of course we have to back up, scrunch over to turn around and
crawl out.
The worst agony of all was knowing that every side passage needed mapping and
was holding up the progress to the back. Vertical mazes are the norm. Passages
are stacked on top of each other requiring climbing and mapping until the absolute
ceiling is found. This ceiling may be as much as one-hundred-fifty-feet above the
stream with as many as three passages in betwe
Dale is always a meticulous mapper. Everything is checked and pushed and
many small leads are mapped. Progress is measured station by station as we pene-
trate into the back. An average of fifty stations set or seven-hundred feet of
passage mapped is the norm per trip. In Spring, 1974, Tom Calhoun, Dale, and I
mapped over a querter of a mile. It was the best crew ever assembled. All of us
were intent on getting into the back. We didn't turn around until we felt we had
accomplished something.
To break out of a time consuming maze into running passage is the dream that
pulled us on. The desire to get on in is a strong motivation. Everytime we got
into the straight and narrow we would celebrate. That is until the passage broke
again and left the main track. A trip Yeatts and Cheryl were on was such. We
spent the entire trip napping a multilevel section. It took hours, The lower
section had been previously mapped and we knew that the passage opened into a
straight solution passage. Before we could go on, though, we had to map the old
upper section. After working steadily, we finished, Dale and I went ahead to
check it out. I hate to say that Dale got excited, but he left me tagging along
behind. We went ahead and found the Chous Siphon and the ladder climb. We
began to feel that the end was near. We should have known better. That was over
five trips (100+ hours) ago.
