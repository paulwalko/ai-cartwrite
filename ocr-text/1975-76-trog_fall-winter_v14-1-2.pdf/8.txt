The Tech Troglodyte
1926
Death Hangs on a Wire
You have probably never heard of Montrose Cave. It has an indistinguished
entrance, a small 1 x 3 foot slit in the earth dropping 10 feet vertically, be-
neath the forested hillside. As we stand in the darkness, a plume of fog is
rising from the small entrance sink to mingle with the blowing snow. A faint
sound carresses the stillness, becoming louder as dim light flashes intermittent-
ly from the entrance. Suddenly, a small mud-covered knapsack hurtles from the
cave. It lands at the edge of the sinkhole, and threatening to continue down-
hill, pauses, and begins to roll hesitantly back towards the slit, stopping near
the edge.
A feeble light emerges from the hole, as a caver climbs out and laboriously
crawls out of the sink across the wet snow-covered leaves. He reaches for the
pack with his right hand, but stops and retrieves the pack with his left, pute
it on his back, and stands erect in the night to check his bearings. He wears
a mud coated hard hat with a carbide lamp, its flame feebly straining against
the darkness and flickering dangerously in the wind. His right hand is ungloved.
His coveralls are water-soaked and covered with sticky mud.
He walks rapidly downhill towards the road, as his feet plunge through the
snow into the soggy leaves and mud, reminiscent of the past two days rain.
Pausing beside a tree with light colored bark, perhaps a beech, he beats his
lamp furiously against the trunk. As he places the lamp to mark the tree, we
can see his face, but faintly. It is young, but creased with worry and fatigue.
There is a sense of urgency in his movements as he descends further only to
pause, look back uphill, and repeat the marking
. He continues in
his intermittent haste until he steps into the 4 strand barbed wire fence which
is halfway down the hill, on the journey to the road. As he forces the strands
down and straddles the wire, he momentarily faces the wind. A strong gust mer-
cilessly snuffs the flame from his lamp. He struggles out of his pack and fum-
bles for his emergency flashlight, shivering as the cold penetrates deep into
his back. Suddenly a shaft of light cowers before the darkness, but persists.
He hurries downhill, crossing a steep field, as the snow is blown horizon-
tally in increasing gusts. The legs of his coveralls have begun to freeze as
his heel hits one of the slabs of limestone, littering the field beneath the
snow. His left leg collapses beneath him and he slides to the bottom of the
icy rock. He slowly stands: then continues downward, reaching the barbed wire
fence above the 10 foot high nearly vertical road bank. He works his way up-
hill along the fence but cannot find an easy crossing. With extreme care, he
starts to climb a fence post, favoring his right arm. The light is between his
teeth. His frozen sleeves and collar crackle as he climbs to momentarily bal-
ance on the top strand. Leaping for the road, he hits the bank and attempts to
run off it -- only to sprawl on the snow covered pavement. He lifts his legs
into the air, slowly rolls to his feet and recovers his flashlight. He looks at
the bank he has descended and digs into the snow to expose the earth beneath.
He wearily stumbles up the road as thoughts of those still underground l'111
his head. He now and then trots in small steps on the slippery uphill surface.
His ears and hands are freezing and his lungs are wind burned. Tears flow from
his eyes and mucus clogs his nose and throat; yet he struggles onward. He tries
to run in the ditch for better traction -- only to break through the ice and
plunge into the freezing mud and water. He beging to shiver uncontrollably.
After a time, he hears a dog barking and finds his way to a farmyard gate.
He crosses the yard and pushes through another gate, as the dog snap3 from the
porch of the farmhouse. The caver struggles up the steps to the porch. His
are frozen solid, as he weakly pounds on the door in frantic senseless-
Â· ness. The porch light comes on.
