Into The Back
Tnis article is a summary of some of the things that never were told during
trip reports. There are hundreds of stories and thousands of details that could
be told about what has happened on the numerous trips into the back of New River.
To fully understand these trips you have to realize that vale Parrott has
been working persistently on his senior year caving project, namely the mapping
of New River Cave, ever since August of 1971.
We usually meet Dale at the Friday party. He is usually so excited that he
is constantly doing a little dance like a kid that has to pee but can't get his
mother to give him permission. Sometimes he'll bring a map, an old map made in
the 50's, held together with bits of tape.
In the cave, Dale shows his conditioning to the cave environment. Usually
carrying his lamp in one hand and announcing that he is favoring one limb because
he hurt it in some outer world activity, he flies into the cave without so muoh as
leaving a trail of dust. Dales tradition for every trip is to bang one of his
knees badly enough to bring forth five minutes of cussing. Cussing makes him
forget that and the sight of virgin passage.
These trips to New River have stayed interesting due to the many incidences
that occur. A string leading into the cave is always a great source of amusement.
We would burn them behind us, but we never found anyone unrolling one. We would
always run into groups of tourists:
Tourist: How you all Doing?
Dale: Pretty Good, Where are you headed?
Tourist: We heard there was a waterfall here. Know how to get to it?
Dale: No, we've never been here before. We followed the string in,
Unce, at the blowhole, we ran into a group who didn't know where to go. The
mapping crew wanted to get around the slower tourist groups
Tourist: Do you know where the passage goes from here?
Happer: No. Have you looked up there?
Tourists Roger's up there. Hey, Roger?
Roger: No, man. It's too tight.
Mapper: How about this hole?
Touristi I Don't know if it can be climbed.
Happer I'll see... Hey, Dale, it goes here, come on, let's go.
At which point the mappers plunged through, leaving the tourists wondering
what to do next. There was a group in the boulder room looking for another exit.
They had gotten a supplement to Cover of Virginia 2 (please let me know if one does
exist) describing a new section in New River:
Tourist: How long did it take you to get back here?
Dale: About forty minutes,
Tourist: Wow, you must have come in a different way than we did!
Another time in the boulder room we were confronted with little flashing
electric lights marking passages. We ran into the people responsible for the
flashers past Tuxedo Junction. They had spent the night there and had homemade
light sources and dozens of electic "Crickets". The crickets were self-contained
flashers equipped with batteries for three days. We talked with them while some
members of their tean showed Dale some passages. We were presented with a couple
of crickets from their many spares. Later that trip I got ahead of Dale and put
a cricket at an intersection. Presently, we had Wale believing the gadgeteers
were ahead of us. He was confused at best.
