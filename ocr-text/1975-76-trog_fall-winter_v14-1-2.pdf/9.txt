The Tech Troglodyte
1976
In the light, we can see that the caver's right hand is white and blood streaked.
His helmet is crushed on the right side. His nose is running and his eyes are
wide in a frightened stare. The farmer slowly open the door with a shotgun in
his hand. Yes they have a phone. Injuries in a cave? Rescue? Come in, come
ini As the caver stumbles into the warm room, the farmer's wife enters and
pauses in amazement. She hurries to put wood on the recently roaring fire.
The caver's pack and helmet are removed. A large discolored swelling is revealed
on the caver's head. His coveralls are stripped off, as he strains to recall a
number to call for rescue. The farmer dials the long distance number as the
caver is stripped to the waist and a blood soaked handkerchief tied around his
right forearm is revealed. The caver moves towards the fire. As the farmer
gets an answer, his wife removes the handkerchief and the caver collapses, un-
conscious.
YOU are at the opposite end of the line! If Montrose Cave were in your
area, how would you develop a rescue effort with such minimal information?
What would you ask the farmer? Equipment? Communications? Weather? Personnel?
If you seriously consider this situation with your group, you will, after much
thought, have to construct a rescue tree. If done properly, the plan could save
a real life. Don't Assume Anything!

THE HARD-COATED GIBBS ASCENDER CAM JAW - A QUESTION
A year or two ago, Gibbs added another chapter to the Gibbs Ascender story
by introducing the optional hard-coated cam jaw. This innovation had been re-
quested by several cavers in an effort to stave off what they
excessive jaw wear in the floating knee assemblies of their personal cam rigs.
I have not had the hard-coated jaw in the field for more than several thousand
feet, but already specialized problems have ar
A new hard-coated cam jaw, in a Davison System knee assembly with floating
shell, slipped over 90% of the time in a nearly continuous manner, under one body
weight, on marine lay Goldline. It also slipped with regularity on clean well-
used mountain lay Goldline, a short time later. No problems have occurred on
Bluewater II, even when climbing with a 170 pound man attached to my harness
(simulated rescue victim), no problems with slipping anyway. On Bluewater II,
the hard-coated cam doesn't want to break loose -- many times a relatively large
amount of force is required to purchase its release, at times exceeding the force
supplied by 1" shock cord at full stretch. Recently, after wear had modified
the 3rd, 4th, and 5th teeth, a continuous high speed 123' run was completed
on used slightly muddy Goldline with no slips.
I have never had a non-coated Gibbs Ascender cam jaw slip on any 7/16" rope un-
der any conditions (except after the 7th tooth had been worn), and would appre-
ciate hearing from anyone having slippage problems. Goldline, because of its
expense and laid construction, may be on the decline as a caving rope in some
areas, but those using hard-coated Gibbs should be aware of the problem and help
define it. It is possible that the hard-coated jaw works well after some of the
coating is abraded off. Ascending devices should have no properties which cause
slippage on any caving rope under any naturally occurring cave or entrance con-
ditions,
