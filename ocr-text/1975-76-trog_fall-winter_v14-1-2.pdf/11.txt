Fall/Winter
The Tech Troglodyte
1976
Then came the serious awards (as if anything at banquet could truly be labeled
as serious. Ed Loud was given a giant Miller Beer can and a miller banner for his
never flagging (yet) duty to the club as Miller Chairman, leading us to two great
victories over the frats in the recent Miller Contests (See elsewhere this issue).
The annual Flame-out of the year went to Doug Perkins this year for being Flamed-
out of his apartment in Roanoke when the entire structure burnt to the ground.
Doug was given a fire extinguisher and a special credit card good for numerous
items that were donated to the Perkini Relief Fund. Items included Cams, a lamp,
packs, etc. Rolf McQueary was awarded the Dedicated Caver of the year for his
continued insanity in driving down from the D.C. area and mapping exploring,
and such with the riff-raff of our ilke for his incredible perseverance in the
face of blind persnickety-ness, he was given a notebook, pencils, compass, pro-
tractor, ruler, and a pocket adding machine to keep track of his mapping and his
total footage mapped. This wonderful award was followed up by the ever popular
Guano Clusters (oh, Bat Shit, you say). This year they were given out toi Jean
and Bob Simonds for their gallant hike of the entire Appalachian Trail, Bob Barlow,
bike Conefrey, and Guy Turenne for their efforts with the formation and consequent
action of the East River Mountain Task Force and the gating of Beacon Cave, and
last but not least to Buddy Penley for his status not only as land-owner but as
hell-raiser for letting us run amuck on his fields for Picnic last year. The final
award went to Don Davison for being... Don Davison. By a petition of the officers
of the club, he was awarded the A.I. Cartwright Honorarium for his continued work
in the field of vertical caving, rescue work, regular caving, and other fun thinge.
With this conclusion, the banquet was ended. Everyone applauded the fantastic
work of the awards committee and headed off to party.
Party. A lovely word isn't it? It can stand for so much activity and so
much time. In the case of the banquet party, it stood for 12 hours as the very
basis of decadence and wild brouhaha. The party was held in the V.FW, hall,
post # 766 in Radford. Two huge rooms accomodated the wild throngs that converged
there. The stereo was in the basement to limit the noise. The Third Tape created
by Doug Perkins, Danny Wright and Lor Windle was a success (at least three times
through) and everyone danced madly. Bill Stringfellow attended in the guise of a
bartender and handled the bar very well. The usual stuff occurred. Everyone was
wiped out by numerous falls and glasses (or cans) of beverages. At one point,
the bar held 27 different bottles of hard liquor, not including the beers, wines,
& Vicks Formula 448 that people had brought.
Thor Brecht and Lor Windle made a desperate run to blacksburk at 2:30 in the
morning to acquire emergency supplies in the mode of 5 8-packs of coke and 8
quarts of ginger ale. A gallant effort and Hurrah! Around 6:00 o'clock the party
started to die. People slowly stirred and started cleaning the place up. by
9:30 everyone was leaving. Another year of memories and deeds had passed away.
In it's place was found nothing but heartache (headache) and that empty feeling
at the pit of the stomach. Some people have yet to recover from the tribulation
that banquet laid before them. The author has, at best, learned to live with his

Note:
Large paper clips can supply the necessary rigidity to immobilize an in-
jured finger. Such splinting may be desirable in the case of fracture, dislo-
cation, severe laceration, or the presence of a deeply imbedded foreign object.
Three large paper clips are insignificantly small and easily carried, but their
value will loom large when their special properties are required.
