False Security and the Gibb≈ü Ascender.
The red avalanche cord, which connects the cam shell to the cam jaw of the
GIBBS ascender, is pretty but does not fulfill its intended purpose -- to main-
tain the components of the GIBBS as a complete unit by keeping the shell from
being accidently separated from the cam jaw. On 10/18/75, the attachments of the
cord to the shell and cam jaw of six (6) GIBBS were tested. The fix ascenders
were unused and equipped with quick release pins. The tests were conducted by
moving the shell and cam jaw in opposite directions, with the intervening ava-
lanche cord being the only connection between the two parts. In every case, the
connection between the shell and cam jaw falled when a force of less than twelve
(12) pounds tension was applied. On three (3) of the ascenders, the attachment
of the cord to the shell failed, while on the other three GIBBS, the connection
of the cord to the cam jaw was the cause of failure. After each failure, the
attachment point at the other end of the cord was tested. During this second
set of tests, 5 failures occurred at less than 12 pound 8 while a single cam jaw
attachment failed at 40 pounds.
An alternative to the presently provided cord is desirable if the chance of
the accidental 1068 of a shell is to be minimized. In the Davison Syy tem, the
difficulty is overcome by using 700 pound test braided nylon cord. The cord is
tied to the eye of the cam jaw using a water knot or ring bend. The other end
of the cord is passed from the inside to the outside of the shell through one of
the upper holes. An overhand knot tied on the outside of the shell completes
the connection. Since the cord connection is relied upon to support body weight
in certain configurations, the cord should maintai
when a force of four hundred (400) pounds is applied as in the test mentioned
above.
