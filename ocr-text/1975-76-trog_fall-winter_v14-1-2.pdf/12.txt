Corrections to "Hauling, Part 1"
From "The Tech Troglodyte", Vol. XIII, #3
Equations 14 and 15 are inconsistant and should be replaced with the
following:
AE = LLP
(14 substitute)
10.5 + U
which describes the behavior of the piggy back family of pulley systems.
Where AE = actual effeciency, U = coefficient of kinetic friction, and P = the
number of pulleys involved. Using equation 14 substitute, and the values of U
given in the article, Table 1 will exhibit changes in columns 5 and 7, and read
as follows:
IE

â€¢ The advantage of using piggy back (PB) systems is shown most dramatically.
Note that block and tackle (B ulley Systems using carabiners are self de-
feating when IE (ideal effeciency) is greater than two.
Thanks to Kirk MacGregor of Ontario, Canada for pointing out the discrepancy
between equations 14 and 15.
