In using the knot, it can most. conveniently be loosened by
grasping the prusik ropes about two inches below the knot with
the Iittle and ring fingers (and possibly the middle finger also)
when sliding the hand up toward the knot, and lifting the prusik
rope this short distance. If one turn is being used, this will
almost always break the knot loose - it may fall into your hand.
With two turns, it may be necessary to use the thumb and index
and middle fingers to rotate the slack. thus produced down around
the top turn in order to loosen the lower turn, particularly on
a muddy rope. When ready to apply weight; to the knoting a light.
pull directly outward may be needed to help "set" the knot, par-
ticularly when one turn is being used. After a few minutes prac-
tice, these motions can be executed without taking any extra time
fo them. Care should be exercised not to let go of a knot while
it is loosened, since it will frequently fall to the end of its
prusik rope, which must then be pulled up to retrive the kno torinese
a "disadvantage" noti enjoyed by any other prusik knote
The secret of this knot lies in the fact thate the prusik
rope enters the knot not through a loop in itself, as in most
knots, but through a wide-open, rigid metal aperture -- the kara-
biner. This eliminates the friction loss which absorbs part of
the tension before it even gets into most knots. This allows
the knot: to grip tighter; and also to release. more easily, since
there is no internal friction within the knot structure to hinder
tightening and loosening.
In general, the knot: will work with only one turn under
good conditions ; litt or no mud (plain water doesn't affect
its performance); a prusik rope no larger than threeweights inch
nylon on half-inch rope, five-sixteeths inch nylon on seven-
sixteenths irich rope, or quarter-inch nylon on three-eights rope,
The prusik rope should be relatively soft and flexible for op-
timum performance. The prusik rope sizes given are the recom-
mended maxima at present; adequate performance is sometimes ob-
tained with size differences of only a sixteenth of an inch,
although this makes the knot liable to spill. Two turns will
work under most conditions, but frequently require a simple
loosening operation. Also, two turns are somewhat less prone to
spill with large prusik ropes. Three turns are impractical;
too much is required to loosen them,
A one-turn karabiner prusik using a shroud line sling will
grip on just about anything except: greased icicles; and two turn's
with shroud line would probably hold even on those, although
there would be a little trouble keeping loops of this thin stuff
from crossing over each other when the knot is being raised.
The loop of shroud line, having a breaking strength of 1100 lbs,
(2X550 lbs.), Would be quite safe. under a person's weight, as
the safe working load would be 220 lbs. This would give a
