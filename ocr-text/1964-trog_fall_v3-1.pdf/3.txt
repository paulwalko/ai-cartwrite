EDITOR'S COLUMN
The VPI Grotto has weathered its worse year since the
Catawba Murder Hole accident,
A feud over leadership systems, which had threatened to
split the club for two years,..came to a head with a motion
to expell a member. A near-fatal accident in Newberry's
Cave united the club during the rescue, but brought unfair
criticism upon the club as a whole by Bill Plummer, who also.
makės: mistakes, especially when writing nasty articles about
the VPI Grotto.
There have been a number of changes around here, Gregg
Marland is cying in Missouri and going to school in his
spare time, leaving the TROGLODYTE for me to nurse: "Vertical
Whitt,!! a former vice-president, is back--again. Credit him
for most of the typing, all of the drawings and maps, and
several articles in this issue,
Rick Nolting, our new president, succeeds Whitey Eubank,
VPI's Man in the West. Our vice-president, the "big little
caver;" is John Eads. He heads both the sifety committee and
the trainee program, two important jobs.
Our secretary is. a cute co-ed crver called Sally Carlson.
I'm the treasurer: Whilo all the covers are watching Sally,
I steal the money.
As of this issue, the subscription rate changes. The
TROGLODYTE now costs 1 € per page, old subscriptions will be
allowed to run out before the new policy is put into effect
for them. If you are a subscriber, you will be notified when
your previous subscription expires. Then just send us some
money ($3 to $5 is a good amount). The rate of 1¢/page will
be deducted from the amount you send until the money is used
up. You will then be notified of this fact. One dollar, for
instance, will buy 100 pages of printed matter. :
Winter quarter caving trips totaled 896 man-hours. The
most popular caves were the Newberry-Banes system and Green-
ville Soltpeter, with five trips apiece. The Newberry-Banes
system also collected the most man-hours: 210. In all, 37
caving trips were reported for the quarter, with 20 different
caves visited.
Spring quarter caving slacked off slightly for a total
of 749 man-hours. The Newberry-Banes system racked up a hugh
total of 281 man-hours, nearly half of the total. · Now River
Cave came in second with 120. Only 11 different caves were
visited for a total of 21 trips. -
Since it has happened before, we would like to state
that the opinions, beliefs, ideas, etc. mentioned in the articles
are those of the author, only:,.. not of the entire Grotto or of
other Grotto' members.
It looks like a good year for the VPI Grotto. In fact,
we are thinking about a Baltimore Extension to revitalize the
depleted Baltimore Grotto. They were fooling everyone with all
those ficticious namos. Tow about it, Baltimore?
