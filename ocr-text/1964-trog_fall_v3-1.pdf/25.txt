Bob's Drop Cave
4/2/64
Rancho Carrizalejo
Coahuila, Mexico
Along the NE base of the Sierra de Carrizalejo, 75 miles
west of Muzquiz, Coahuila, Mexico, there lie three sinkholes
in a line. They are about 50 feet apart. This cave is found
in the center sinkhole.
The cave (see Map 3, page 22-A) has developed within 250
horizontal feet; it drops nearly 200 feet in this distance.
It was entirely virgin before we entered it. The cave is
completely dry, and contains very few water-formed formations.
However, in some of the lower rooms, walls are covered with
sparkling white calcite crystals an inch in diameter and up
to three inches long. Where the oimestone is bare, it is often
beautifully patterned in reds, browns, white, and grays.
Iwo large brown bats were observed, as was a spider. The
spider was three inches long, and had white spots running down
the length of its brown body.
Because of lack of time we had to leave several leads
unchecked. .

A NEW MERCER COUNTY (WEST VIRGINIA) CAVE
Both the 1960 Speleo Digest (page 1-78) and Caverns of
West Virginia mention Honacker Cave. John Cooper, author of
the Digest article, oither discovered another cave that he
thought was Honacker, or else Davies has his directions wrong.
The latitude given by Davies (370187481') is correct, but the
longitude (80055 1:42:1) should be 8005573511.
Cooper's directions are essentially correct. About I
mile east of the junction of Routes 21:9 and 12 (Narrows quad)
is a large sign marking a road leading to a fish hatchery.
Turn onto this road, crossing the East River almost immediately
over a wood bridge, drive past the hatchery, bear left at the
next two forks, cross a wooden bridge over a creek and then
make a sharp right turn just across the bridge. Follow this
road up a steep slope. After the road begins going downhill,
look for a white frame house and a collapsed barn house is
located on topo map) in the valley to your right. Honaker Cave
is directly behind the barn. A group of local boys recently
broke the formations blocking further passage (see Cooper's
description), but found only more crawlway.
