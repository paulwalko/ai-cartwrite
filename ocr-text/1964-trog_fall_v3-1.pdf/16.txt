we entered a 150 foot long, yet comfortable, crawlway. The second
room was about seventy feet in height and had a nice stream flow-
ing through it. The main feature of this room illustrates its'
closeness to the surface. A ground hog had made his home on a
ledge at the very top of the room. After a somewhat inadequate
mental preparation, we discarded all warmth and dove into the
stream, With never more than a foot of air space, and usually a
great deal less, we progressed about two hundred feet. The "back"
room is really the center of a maze of about five tunnels that
curved and twisted quite a lot: however, no matter how hard they
try, they still end up nowhere, with one exception. One leds to
a tall narrow room and a rather tricky drop. There seems to be
more cave but our fate was decided by our lack of time or warmth.
Sometime later we stumbled from the entrance with a determination
to someday return. Several prospective virgin caves were also dis-
covered.

The weekend before exams we decided to take a break in our
arduous studying (?) and go caving.. Lead by Whitey Eubank, our
group left Blacksburg about 1:30 P.M. for Beacon Cave just south
of Bluefield, W. Va. We had heard that it was near the Beacon
Drive-Inn; therefore, this was where we started asking for direc-
tions to the cave. About 30 minutes later we found the entrance
in a small sink about 200 yards in back of the drive-inn.
After searching fruitlessly for 30 minutes for a small crawl-
way in the entrance room that lead to the rest of the cave, we met
a group from a newly formed cave club from Concord College. They
were coming out of the cave and showed us the crawlway. It is to

When we came to the end of the crawlway, at the Bat Room, we
headed to the left (up stream). In about one-third mile we came
to a point where the passage narrowed to a crawlway with the stream
running through it. Rather than setting wet and muddy, we decided
to turn around and follow the downstream passage. Back at the Bat
Room, we continued straight downstream through some fairly unstable
breakdown. This continued on through mostly walking passage with
two short, rather hard climbs. After about a mile we came toa pool
some 20 ft. in diameter extending from wall to wall. Because it
was getting late and because we did not want to get wet, we turned
back. The trip back to the entrance was quite easy except for one
place where we became momentarily confused. It was a large room
filled with massive breakdown. After 15 minutes we found the
correct passage and continued out.
