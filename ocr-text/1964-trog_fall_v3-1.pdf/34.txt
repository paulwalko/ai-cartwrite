NEWCASTLE MURDER HOLE REOPENED--BUT!
The famous Murder Hole near Newcastle, Virginia, has been
reopened after being closed for nearly three years. The cave,
owned by the Sizer family, wa's closed due to the careless acts
of inconsiderate cavers. They were plagued with gates being
left open, fences being ridden: down, disturbances created while
leaving the cave late at night; Carbide dumped in the fields,
cows turned loose, and cars being driven across the fields, tear-
ing up the turf. In light of this, it is a wonder the cave was
ever reopened, even under the strict conditions which now exist.
The VPI Grotto has negotiated the opening of this cave,
making several trips to Newcastle for that purpose. The condi- .
tions of the reopening, then, tend to favor VPI, due to our
efforts in that direction. Here they are:
Only members of the: VPI Grotto are allowed in the cavo,
Anyone else must be accompanied by a member of the VPI Grotto.
This condition is a result of the considerate, responsible atti-
tude shown by the Tech cavers.
A printed release form must be presented to Mr. or Mrs.
Sizer, signed by all persons in the party, before entering the
cave,
A cave register, prepared by the VPI Grotto and given to the
Sizer family, must be signed upon entering and leaving the cave,
The NSS conservation policy and the VPI Grotto safety code
will be observed. Violation of any of these conditions will
undoubtedly result in permanent closing of this impressivo cavern.
The VPI Grotto urges all cavors to exercise consideration
toward caye owners. It is a sorry situation when the careless-
ness of a few can spoil it for so many. A little effort in
the right direction will prevent many incidents such as the sad
ones at Roger's Belmont and Mystic caves.
