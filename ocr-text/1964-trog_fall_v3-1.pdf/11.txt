or special supplies, and the very fact that I was along made
the party anything but highly skilled. At this time, I wasn't
even a hanizontal leader. The only thing out of the ordinary
we carried was 70 feet of shroud line for the 160 foot drop'!
near the back.
Leaving early, Sunday morning, we arrived att the cave ato
about: 8:00 a.m., only one hour later than we had expected
(Quite an acheivement within itself.) Three hours latter we
were standing at the top of the 160 foot dirop". By now I was
beginning to wonder where all those "torturous crawiis" and
"greati distances" wereo (We may have covered as much as 1 mile)
In fact, this seldom-seen part of the cave impressed me very
muchi One pant was especially interesting: the passage was
about: 2-3 fee to wide, with sheer parallel walls rising ate a slight
angle: from the sand floor to a ceiling which was Quts of my sight.
These walls are., in all probability, the hanging and foot wall
blacks of the saltville faulthie In the back of the known cave,
the ceiling drops down and the floor fall's away. As we stood
there... 2 things became evident to us. First, we had lostt track
of the draft, and second, our 70 feet; of shroud line wasn't
much to work with. We couldn't see much future: in going down
the drop., because we were att least the height of the ceiling
below. the surface, and there was no draft: blowing upi the drop.
But; we decided to make the descent: anyway in hopes we could push
the lastü siphori: and possibly find another chamber beyond. Forme
turratly, we found 2 mud pitans Ieft; in the cave from a previous
trip, So we forced theminto the sand near the edge, and spent
about an hour making a ladder out of the shroud limeMeanwhile
we tried to trace: the breeze, Using pipe smoke. as a detector,
we found tható 1100' down the passage, there was a slight breeze

to be: a hole in the ceiling. Bill attempted to chimney up to.
this hole, but only succeeded it. dislodging lange quantities of
mud from the walls..Meanwhile, the drop was rigged and we body

here it was possible to climb the rest of the way down to the
stream level. Bill and I climbed down to the stream while Whitey.
and Pete. Iooked into various holes: orr the middle level, Bill
pushed the last siphon for another. 301 unitill it became a total
siphon Progress: thus stymied, we climbed out and headed home
Four hours later we were out of the cave, for a total of 9 hours.
Naw. thats I've had time. to ana liy ze: the cave, I tend to believe
that a lot; of nice. cave is being reglected because of a few
