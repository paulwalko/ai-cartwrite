Cooper's article mentions two other caves on the Honakor
property. One, with a 100 foot entrance drops was notfound.
Residents say it is in the field northeast of, but fairly close.
to, the farmhouse. They also warn that the entrance is so
small that it could be stepped into. without being seen. High.
.weed's make the entrance difficult to spot. A large body of
water is reported to exist in this cave.
The third cave (named Cave Rat Cave by the author) is
at 80055125" W, 37Â°18'50" N. It is almost diectly east of
Honacker Cave. To find it, boar SE, up the montain at a slight
angle until you reach a stream, then follow the stream down,
It flows into the cave. The two caves are only about 200-
300 yards apart.
About 30 feet inside the entrance, the stream flows into
a low side passage, not explored. A few feet further ob, a .
small passage to the left drops rapidly about six feet into a
low-ceiling but good-sized room. Several crawlways. lead off,
one of which had a good current of air. This crawl was fol-
lowed for 15 feet until blocked by a stalagmite. It continued
a bit larger beyond this barrier.
The main passago becamo a crawlway, then, opened up again.
Further into the cave, to ono side of a large formtion, is
a ten foot climbablo drop to a lower level.: An opening on this
lovel, too small to get through, led to a pit.
Further down the main passage is an intersection with
two other passages. The intersection has quite a bit of large
breakdown, through which one can climb. down to the floor,
ten foot below. Any passages leading off from the bottom
are effectively filled with logs, rocks, and other debris..
A cave rat with two young has a nest here. Empty Pepsi bottles :
were found, indicating local cavers had been here.
The passage to the left forked. The left fork rose sharp-
ly, becoming a tight crawlway. It was not explored. A small
hole in this passage loads to an "echo chamber" room. An.
arrow on one of the walls in the room points toward a possible :::..
lead 20 feet above. The right fork ended in a rimstone pool- ...
floored crawl, with rat tracks visible in muddy areas. It's
tight, but may go...
The passage to the right had a high ceiling (about 40
feet) with a possible lead going off near the top. A small
crack, too narrow for chimnoying, led down and to the left. i
The floor of the crack was unstable and had a sheer drop:of
about 15 feet. It looked promising, but almost impossible,
to get back up. The only other lead was though a small hole
about waist high and a foot wide. Peering through the hole, .
a small room, then another hole, then what could have been
either another room, a pit, or more passage could be seen...
Air was blowing through the hole, and the cave was more "alive"
than any other section. :
The explored part of the cave was once stream passage,
Evidence of wood and grass carried in by the water was almost
everywhere. The stream, however, now flows elsewhere. It
was not seen or even heard after it left the main passage 20
feot from the entrance.
