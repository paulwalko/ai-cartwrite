The caves lie in a valley between East River Mt. and an
unnamed ridge, and there may be a large underground system.
Several sinks occur along the valley floor. The three caves
are all very close to each other, and may connect. :: Perhaps
the disappearing stream in Cave Rat Cave forms the lake in the
cave with the 100 foot drop.

Editor's Note: President of the VPI Grotto for the coming
year, Rick Nolting has put a great deal of time into an effort
to check known caves and discover new caves on Big Walker Mtog
Bland county. The Newberry-BÃ¥ nes system (seo else where in
this issue) and many other caves were discovered and explored
in the forties and fifties, but little work has been attempted
in the sixties until now.
Visions of great cavern systems drow several expeditions
of cavers to the Big Walker Mountain area of Bland county
during November and December of the past year and the first
part of t is year. Having already yielded such caves as the
Newberry-Banes complex and the muddy shafts of Miller's, the
trips seemed promising enough. After several reconnaissance
runs, involving interviews with farmers and with farmers'
daughters (these latter talks were aptly handled by that worldly
caver, Gary McCutchen) and several visits to known caves, a
series of exploration trips set out.
Mr. Munsey, who owns some thousand acres of land stretching
across Big Walker Mt., bounced Gary, Joe Smith, and me up the
lower slopes of the ridge for about one and a half miles in
his joep. At an sltitude of 2720 feet we found our first
virgin cave. It was entered by digging through some assorted
gravel and boulders at the bottom of a ten foot chimney. Then,
after Gary had been removed, we explored what was essentially
a stream passage with intermittent rooms for about 300 feet.
We were stopped by a horizontal slot about a foot high filled
with rocks and the major part of the stream. It was named
the "Grunt Slot" for obvious roasons, and Joe and I squirmed
through, leaving Gary grunting on the opposite side. We were
able to explore another 300 feet or more of passage, which
left us in a steep mud covered room about 60 feet high and 30
feet wide, having several small leads in the bottom. Time was
running short so we returned to the surface, discovering that
Gary had located another cave for us about 200 yards away
through the woods at the bottom of a deep hollow.
