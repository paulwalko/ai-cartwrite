Parti Two:.
NEW RIVER EXPEDITION
Jay Murry
January 19, 11964
Personnel: Roger Amado, Ted Fix
We: left: V.P.I. at: 10:30 a.m. for New River Cave located
about five miles soutih-west of Newport:, Virginia. Before entering
the cave, we checked same rocks up the road from the caye: for
quartz crystals and fossils..
Our purpose of going to New River Cave was to see if it:
would be possible to make æ new entrance to the cave where the
cheek: comes out of the hill, below the mouth of the cave. We
entered the cave at 12:45 pim, and went back to the creek. pass-
age. Following the creek passage towards the entrance, we tra-
veled for about forty: minutes. Most of the time we were bent:
over or crawlling along the creek as the passage was low. Farther
along the passage, and pasti survey" mark: "Z-115.1), I believe, we
could stand in the passageway. We continued until we came to
what: seemed to be an end. Our time was running out, so we had
to leave without determining if we could make a new entrance
We: did, however, decide that: going along the creek would be
more trouble than going up the hill to the naturall entrance,

· NEW RIVER CAVE

Personnel: Pete Stoller, Rick: Grenoble, and my husband, Bill.
My favorite of caves is undoubtedſy New River After sixty-
five hours of trips I have come to love and hate the place all
im orie: breathe The firste 2400 feet; back to the waterfall! are
scenic and fairly easy for an inexperienced caver, but I pride
myselif in Heing one of the very few women who have negotiated
the far reaches of thatt huge hole in the ground. I have been
om. photographic trips, survey trips, and even: a push trip in: there,
The formations are. Quttstanding, and each trip shows a new and
unique speleo them. The survey. trip started at eight on a Sat
urday morning. Our minds were set; or. the back of the cave, butte
as strength would have it, we were unable to progress furtier
tham the last siphon before a tiring climb up through breakdown #
We: ate in the supper room, which is just beyond the "impassable
passagei," and started the long chawi Qutto The physical problem:
was; natt as hard as the mentall effectis I sustained after fourteen
hours in the dark, so when I got stuck in a mine-inch crack at
the beginning of the passage, I Broke into nervaus: hystanics,
My recommendations to any' giirill wishing to see the backill of the
Cave would be to eat well before the trip to get at least tert
Hours sleep the nightt befare, and to putt alll thoughts of cIaustro-
phobia aut af mind. The trip is tiring and should be done only
after a sufficienti amount of experience underground
