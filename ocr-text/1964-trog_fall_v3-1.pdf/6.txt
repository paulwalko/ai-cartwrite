Note that the prisik ropes cross the strands
rather than wirap around the rope parallel to the
strands. This is important, the holding power of
the knot is seriously reduced if the prusik ropes
are wrapped around the rope parallel to the strands.
Since the prusik: ropes aze held above the karabiner
as it: is rotated with the lay, the prusik ropes
are rotated against the lay, which is the desired
situation. On a braided rope, such as perlon,

Certain precautions should be observed in using this knot..
Do not, under any circumstances, allow the knot to bear on the
gate side of the karabiner, for obvious reasonsi In fact, the
karabiner should remain in approximately a horizontal position.
