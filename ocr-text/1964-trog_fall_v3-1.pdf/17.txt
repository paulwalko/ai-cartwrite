On the day before Ground Hog's Day, a small expeditionary.
force gathered on the campus of VPI. Promptly at 1:00 the party
set off to explore the underworld of West Virginia. The îirst
difficulty to beset this noble band was the problem of getting to
West Virginia, Having found out the hard way that the Salt Sul-..
phur Turnpike was blocked by two-foot snow drifts, they decided to
go by way of Pearisburg. (ED. NOTE: As any fool'knows, the Salt
Sulphur Turnpike is a minor foo trail past Mt. Lake, virturally
impassible.)
Through the efforts of the diligent navigator, R. E. Whittemore,
the small party arrived at Fletcher's Cave in Monroe County about
an hour and a half before sunset. The owner wanted us out by dark
so the party had only about one and one-half hours to see nearly
3000 ft. of well-decorated horizontal cave. There was apparently
very little vandalism, for the formations were some of the most
beautiful to be seen anywhere. The main stream passage was læge
and easily walked, so the party c uld see most of the cave in the
time allowed.
Since an hour and a half of caving could hardly justify a trip
of 75 miles, we hunted around for another caye, Whit said he knew
of a cave a few miles away in the fan of Peter's Mountain. The
owner was very friendly and journeyed out on that snowy night to
show us the cave entrance. We followed the stream into vhat we
thought was the cave entrance. After slithering under a rock and
getting rather damp we found that we were not yet in the cave.
The true entrance was not far off so the small party grunted its.
way through several thousand feet of tight passage. It was obvious
that the cave flooded from time to time from the vegetable matter
left deep in the cave. Realizing the late hour and the uncertain
weather, the party emerged from the caye having spent a little
over two hours underground.

The trip was taken to check out some leads in the. tilted
room. We used the back entrance and quickly reached the Queen's
Bath area.
The tilted room ends in two wells. The left well is a 100
foot back rapped from the crawlway. The pit ends in a crawl in
breakdown, I could not find a lead out of the well,
The right well ends in a sixty-foot pito I did not go down
the pit. A sign on the wall. said, "Dead End Pit, 60 feet." TWO
pits beyond the turnoff to the Queen's Bath were explored. The
first is nothing, the second is 15 feet deep. There is a highlead,
which was not entered.
