A sample of black earth was recently collected from a
ceiling deposit in Aquo Cave, Highland county, Va. It is
apparently a stream doposit left during high water stages and
is also found in some lower areas of the passage.
Analysis was conducted by Sam Dunaway in the testing
laboratory of the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co.
He reports:
"The sample was ground to 100+ mesh and dried at 110°C
for 24 hours. All determinations were made colormetrically
on a Beckman Model DU Spectrophotomoter except calcium and
silica, which were done gravimetrically.
"A microscopic examination showed that the manganese
and other heavy metals were deposited as a black film on
sand grains and sandstome flakes. A considerable amount of
clay was present.
"The analysis ran as follows:
Manganese
11.4%
Aluminum
7.72%
Cobalt
0.09
Nickel
-0.11
Copper
0.025%
Titanium
0.27%
Iron
5.29%
Calcium
7.4%
Silicon dioxide.: 33.3%
"'Magnesium, lead, and zirconium reacted positively to
qualitative determinations, but no barium: was found. An ion
exchange technique is being applied for its separation in
trace quantities with subsequent analysis done on the flame
photomotor."
