This cave has no known natural entrances. About 60 days: ..
ago it was broken into by fluoride miners. Tho miners now.
use part of the cave as a mine shaft. (See Map 1, page 21-A)
“The upper portions of this cave are dry and dusty. Flakes
fall off the formations when they are touched. In the lower
rooms however, live formations of great beauty are found. Long
soda straws are prominent, and helectites up to eight inches.
long cover everything in profusion.
The floors of these lower rooms are covered with what ..
appears to be a very rich soil, up to a foot in depth. It is
not guano (in fact, no bats were observed in the cave), but
appears to have washed into the rooms.,
Going into the cave, we noticed a large increase in tem-
perature as we left the cool upper portions. This may have
been due, however, to humidity, as we did not have a thermometer
with us.
The cave is rapidly being vandalized by the miners and ...
local ranch hands.
