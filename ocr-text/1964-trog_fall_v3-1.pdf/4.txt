THE KAZRABINER PRUSIK
The karabiner prusik is a semi-mechanical prusik knot suit-
able for use in climbing a rope (but not as a safety prusik,
such as a chest prusik when rappelling.)
It is a very "fast" knot, loosening very easily. It is
also the only known knot which will hold ($ prusik rope 'on half-
inch or seven-sixteenths inch nylon) with only one turn.' HOW-
ever; it will hold with one turn only under good conditions:
with'a muddy rope, it is necessary to use two turns.
The knot will be illustrated in the tied condition with
one or two turns. (Three turns require too much work to get
the slack into the bottom turn, and generally are'nt needed
anyway.) Also, step-by-step illustrations will be given for
tying the knoti
