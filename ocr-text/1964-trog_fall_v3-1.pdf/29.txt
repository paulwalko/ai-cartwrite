A few weeks later, a party of several trainees, Jim
Charlton, Jeanette Skeleton, and I visited the cave Gary had
located previously. We followed a tall narrow fissure for
about 200 feet downward at an angle of 30° until we were stopped
by flooded passageway. What lies beyond this, I can only sur-
mise, but it is still there if anyone wants to find out.
(Editor's Note: When dry, the large passage funnels down into
a small hole in the floor. Near this hole, the debris cover-
ing the floor becomes unstable, sliding toward the hole. A
rope would be helpful as a safeguard since a drop could exist.)
These two caves we dubbed Munsey's numbers 1 and 2, respectively,
The crowning blow, error, touch to our Bland county ram-
blings occurred not long after when a "hardy" (har, har) crew
of Joe Smith, Sally Carlson, Pat Couple; Gary McCutchen, R. E.
Whittemore, and me headed once again into the wilds. John
Meadow, a 16 year old resident of the valley, volunteered his :
services and led us on a mile or SQ jaunt across the hills to
several caves. The weather was clear and cold, but the snow
had drifted to several feet in places making cross-country
hiking very interesting. In a short while our original party
of seven was now three separate units--John, Whitt, and Joe
had formed the lead; Gary was keeping the two girls company
about a half mile behind (Ed. Note: All right, so I was out
of shape); and I was somewhero in the middle.
Eventually we all stumbled into the cave, and since we
had managed to waste sufficient time roaming around, it was
growing darkor. . Of course, we had not carried any gear with
us, so Gary and I trudged back to the car and managed to drive
it within half a mile of the cove. Informing me that his car
gets lonesome at night away from the. VPI parking lot, Gary
"volunteored" to remain in stitu, while I lugged some miscel-
laneous gear back to the frigid cavors on the mountain. The
cave proved un-virgin, but interesting enough. We explored
about 700 feet of tube-like passages and various Olongated
low-ceilinged rooms bofore finding a long flat-on-the-stomach-
type crawlway. We managed to yank and push ourselves at least
150 feet into where it opened up slightly. We were unable to
penetrate any further bocause the passage got even smaller.
It seemed to me that I heard a familiar grunt echoing down
the passage, so I knew it must be time to head back.
(Managing Editor's Note: This article was written prior
to the release of H. H. Douglas' book, Caves of Virginia. At
that time, the inadequacies of this reportt were not realized.
There seems to be quite a deviation between Caves of Virginia
and actual facto It is our hape that we will be able to bring
some order out of the existing chaos'. The blame for the in-
accuracies found in Caves of Virginia cannot be placed en.
tirely upon Mr. Douglas, but; upon the failure of the people
who originally checked this area, and üpon noti finding another
Newberry's, neglected to keep accurate and careful records of
their findings. So, look for future issues of the Troglodyte
to contain valuable additions and corrections to Mr. Douglas'
antholiagy:)
