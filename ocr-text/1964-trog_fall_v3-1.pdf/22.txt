Onlly, ONE member allowed the chest. prusik to catch him.
All of the others involuntarily grabbed the long rope, pulling
the knot down with them. They had to be caught by the Belayer.
This test indicates: a serious need for practice at releasing
tihe rope when falling. The grabbing action is so strong that
experienced cavers', knowing what to expecting fail to release
their hald.
The VPI Grotto: urges all other Grottas and caters to include
the three-rope mig in their training programs. The next accidente
of this sort may not end so happily.

CAVING IN MEXICO
Editors Note: Whitey and Bob left VPI for a trip llout west:
at the end of winter quarter, · This letter and the accompaning
cave maps and descriptions trace their joumy" to California,
Dear Cavers,
Bob Croft and I arrived here in southern California about
a week ago. We're living off the fat of the land (Wayne Elliott)
for the time being,
This is a great place, with beautiful weather, beautiful
girls, plenty of good paying jobs, and the freeways. The free-
ways are more exciting than doing Newberry's 180 foot drop with-
out a rope. The only problem is that the caves are mostly more
than 100 miles away. However, the entire Los Angeles area is
underlain by a complex of steam tunnels.
Enclosed you will find reports for the files and the Troglom
dyte from field trips made by the Mexican Extension of the VPI
Grotto,
We regret to inform you that since we came to California
the Mexican Extension has become inactive; however, the Califor-
nia. Extension of the VPI Grotto is ding fine. In fact, it has
recently merged with Dick Reardon's Southern California Grotto.
The new name is still in litigation; however, it appears that
it will be the Southern California Extension of the VPI Grotto.
The caves of Mexico were fabulous, as you can see from the
reports and maps enclosed. A tremendous number of big virgin
caves await anyone with vertical equipment. Most of the moun-
tains are entirely limestone, reaching to 12,000 feet in eleva-
tion. You see huge openings high on river-cút canyon walls.
They can only be reached by rappeling down from the top, some-
times several hundred feet, or by climbing an equal distance up
the weathered and rotten vertical limestone walls.
We visited the cave in Buesta Monte that was the object of
a post-convention field trip this spring. If you made it to Texas
for the convention, we hope you took the field trip. The cave
is unbelievably huge and beautiful.
By the way, Wayne and Sanya were married in June, Another
old explorer bites the dust.
