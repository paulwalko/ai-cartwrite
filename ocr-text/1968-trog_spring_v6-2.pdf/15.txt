THE TECH TROGLODYTE - SPRING 1968
The Cribb Cave locality is particularly interesting. Ci 5b is
the only reported cave in that whole valley; not another cave is
known for 10 miles in either direction; not even a rathole. In March,
another cave known a's Perkin's Cave was located in the area and at
least 1000 feet of passage explored. This is somewhat of an indication
that there is more to be found in that area.
Here we have an accumulation of data, an attempt to understand
and correlate; and a whistle-in-the-dark at predictions, Before
I close, however, let me place a value judgement on these predictions.
Let us say 50 percent. But even if we don't enjoy two successes out
of four, these areas have received only scanty attentions and need to
he investigated anyhow. Happy hunting.

HOW TO TAKE A BATH COUNTY CAVE
Troy Glaudight here with another subterranean adventure. This
tine Harry Travers, Rhimston Poole, and I decided on an overnight
trip to Bath County. Two trainees, Floe Stone and Wax Piton
accompanied us and, since this was their first ca:: - experience, were
inclined to ask many questions in order to tap our great reservoir
of speleo-knowledge, Max was especially interested in seeing an
anticline although he really hadn't any idea what one was.
. Arriving at Aqua Campground for the night, I took time to mention
that Lockridge's Aqua Cave, sometimes referred to as Refrigerator
Spring, was just up the ravine a ways, We were also in the area of
some other large caverns such as Clark's, Crossroads, Butler, and
Breathing Cave, Â· Floe. commented that they seemed to have everything
but Kitchen Sink, I ignored her the rest of the trip.
Meanwhile, max had found the entrance to Aqua and wanted to:
know if it was anticline, Resurgence, yes; anticline, no. We
explored it anyway.
The next morning over breakfast we concluded to tour Breathing
Cave. At the belly crawl I halted the group 80 that they could
experience the alternating flow of air from whence the cave derives
its name. Harry went on to explain that this phenomenon is caused by
what is known to geologists as an alluvial fan. Max expressed
interest in seeing this in hopes that it might be connected, in some
way, to an anticline, so we proceeded into ti - depths.
The trip went along smoothly through the Camp Room, Sand Alley,
and the parallel passages. Floe and Max appeared to be exceptional
trainees negotiating the crawls and squeezes without complaint.
