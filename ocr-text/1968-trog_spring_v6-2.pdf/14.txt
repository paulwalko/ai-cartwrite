in the area, then the conditions must be right. Profound? Let's face
it, nothing knows better what conditions are most conducive to.
cavern development than the cave itself. Look at Bath County-
five systems all clustered together. In Bland County, three systems
less than a mile apart. How does this help Casual Spelunker find
more systems?
1) He knows the area must have potential,
2) Other casual spelunkers in the area tend to exhaust their
energies on the known large caye(s).
Remember how, earlier, we noted with interest that most of the
bis caves added to Table 1 in the last 3 years were known to exist
then, but their true size was not discovered at that time? Many
hours of casual VPI spelunking were spent in Newberry-Bane's Cave,
then, in one fell swoop, the two well-known adjacent caves were found
to be much larger than what they were originally suspected to be.
Now, to make this article truly valuable to VPI cavers, I will
stick my neck out and attempt to predict where four large systems
rema in to be discovered.
1) Somewhere near Wytheville,
2) Somewhere in a zone occupied by Stonley's Cave and Jessiels Cave,
3) In Sinking Creek Valley.
4) Between Crib! Cave and Hayter's Gap.
The Wytheville locality is a far-out predict... I would have
Laughed at the idea two years ago. But since theit, we discovery
of three systems has indicated that the area may be quite auspicious.
Slusser's Chapel Cave, Janes Cave, and Interstate 81 Cave all lie
within a stone's throw of the Pulaski Fault, Slusser's C. and
James Cave are both in the same formation; Elbrook Dolomite. A
major drainage divide crosses this belt just west of Wytheville,
Perhaps one of the reported but not explored caves is awaiting
discovery. Nonetheless, the largest known cave in Wythe County,
Pickett's Cave, has only 1500 feet on known passage; but then Crih!
Cave and Slusser's were both thought to be 2000 feet J.ong and were
already the largest known caves in their respective counties until
VPI cavers began to map them,
The Stonley's-Jessie's area covers quite a bit of territory,
some of which was checked out this past March. Three caves with
over 2000 feet of passage were discovered, but there are still
some areas to be investigated.
On this Sinking Creek locality, I'm cheating a bit. There is
a cave in the area, known as Two-Mile Cave, supposed to be two miles
long. The owner gets his drinking water from the cave, so it is
closed for all practical purposes. Considering the conditions,
however, if the cave is ever explored, IÂ° 1.1 be willing to wager
that it is at least a half a mile long.
