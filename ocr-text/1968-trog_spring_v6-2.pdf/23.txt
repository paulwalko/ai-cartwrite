THE TECH TROGLODYTE - SPRING 1968

Breakovers pose no problems. On a sharp breakover your body is
above it before the cams even get there so one can easily grab on to
the rope above. The 1/8 inch thick can slides fairly easily up a rope
on long smooth breakovers unlike bulky knots which are sure to jam
between the rope and the rock. A simple bending of the knee brings the
foot cans out of contact with the breakover while at the same time the .
arns are free to push the body out from the rock should the chest
can not slide.
So far I have found only two faults, Getting into a cam ris
takes atleast as long as setting up a three knot prusik rig and
it is hard to get started without someone holding the rope below you.
The latter is a common fault of most mechanical ascenders but once twenty
fret off Elic ground, this is no longer a problem.

RABIES VACCINE FOR CAVERS
Recently a friend was scratched by a bat in flight, and for a
while was quite concerned about the possibility of radies infection. .
This led me to think about my own chances of contracting the disease;
since I deliver mail, and often walk to work, I meet more than my
share of unfriendly dogs. Also, caving and hiking in Southwest
Virginia might expose me to the disease, Twenty per cent of the
victums of all animal bites or scratches develop rabies (2), and
onemay have the misfortune to be included in that twenty per cent.
Rabid animals should be held for a period of ten days to make sure
of the disease. If not possible to catch the animal alive, the series
oi shots should be begun at once. Rabies is a disease to be carefully
treated,
Davis, writing for the Bat Research News, suggests that perhaps
everyone should take preventive vaccine for rabies (3). He quotes the
Weekly Morbidity and Mortality Report of the Communicable Disease Center
of the U.S. Public Health Service of 15 May 1965 as reporting a
cumulative total of 1946 rabid animals reported throughout the U.S. (3).
It has been reported that bats tend to become carriers of the rabies
virus, not only the Desmodus, (vampire. bat), but several from our
own area, including Myotis, Pepistrellus, and Eptesicus (4).
The brown bats, (Eptesicus f. and Myotus 1.), which we have in
this area, are found to cultivate the virus through the hibernation
process, a "reservoring mechanisinyjee that tends to preserve the virus
in the body of a bitten or scrathced individual with full potency (4).
It has been reported that individuals can contract the disease via
inhalation of the virus in the air of bat caves (3). Burrows comments
