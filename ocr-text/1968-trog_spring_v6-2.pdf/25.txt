experimental patient, and had a different person give each dose. Only
one dose caused stiffness, and that was caused by injecting some of
the vaccine into the muscle, I had no problems, reactions, or complaints,
other than I had too much trouble getting the vaccine in the first
place.
The rabies vaccine which I took is listed as Rabies Vaccine,
U.S.P., (Duck Embryo) Dried Killed Virus (1). This means that the
vaccine is made of the rabies virus grown in the embryo of ducks, and
then killed and processed. The vaccine is superior in some ways to
the old form of the vaccine which was cultivated in brain tissue,
and which was likely to cause adverse reactions when used in treatment
of exposed patients (1).
There are two schedules which may be used in this treatment:
The first procedure consists of four subcutaneous injections
of one milliliter each. The first three injections are given
one week apart, and the fourth is given five to six months after
the third. The second procedure consists of a series of three
injections of one milliliter each. The first two are given
one month apart, and the third is administered seven months
later (1).
It must be noted that the preventative vaccine does not insure
complete protection, but then nothing can do so, sloot of life in a
sealed environment. The recipient of the preventive vaccine may
require only a booster shot if he has had mild exposure to rabies,
Mild exposure is defined as a lick on abraded skin or a single bite
from an infected domestic animal not on the head, neck, face, or arm.
A severe bite is a single bite on the head neck, face, or arm or
multiple bites or one from a wild animal (1). Depending on severity
of exposure, the full series of post-exposure injections for rabies
prevention may be either fourteen daily doses of vaccine administered
subcutaneously in the abdomen, or it may require two injections for
the first seven days of the treatment , making a total of twenty-one
doses. (1). Whether or not one has had the preventive treatment for
rabies, he should immediately wash any bite with soap and thorough
scrubbing and see a doctor immediately.
