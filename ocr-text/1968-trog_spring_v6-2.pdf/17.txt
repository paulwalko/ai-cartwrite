THE TECH TROGLODYTE : SPRING 1968
INCIDENT IN CASS
There seems to be a reviving interest in cave rescue, The NSS
has a Iational Rescue Coordinator and most regions have a rescue network
of one kind or another. It's been a couple of years since Billy Gus
Karras came and went and I guess we've recovered from him. Membership
in the NSS is climbing rapidly but many people not associated with
us go caving and get into trouble, Before I go any further, I'd
like to say that the following rescue has been narrated in several
other publications. These articles have been either newspaper accounts
or written by a member of the party who was not present during the
rescue. This then is a first hand account and is, Hopefully, Not:
distorted in any way.
About 4:30 pm, Sunday, March 17, Phil Lucas, chairman of the
Shenandoah Valley Grotto, called me at home and asked if I could go to
Cass Cave and help pull a person out. Held been inthe cave for about
thirty six hours and was not injured. There already were several people
from the National Radio Astronomy Observatory at Green Bank at the cave
but they needed manpower to get this fellow up the 180 foot drop.
I had been in Cass three Marchs before and was expecting the water
to be up and the cause of the trouble, Myself, Phil, Ed Bauer, Rick
Hicklin, Rodger Wood. Tom Robertson, and Dave Wood, all of SVG,
arrived at Cass around 8 pm. We met Mike Balister from the Observatory
and learned that the water was not too deep; also that the drop was
rigged with a cable ladder.
: At the Belay Loft we met two kids from Cass Who had lowered a
duffle bag containing a sleeping bag, stove, food and a walkie-
talkie, We hauled the ladder up along with the belay line ( a rather
scarred item that should have been condemned long ago) and duffle bag.
We rigged the drop with a 250 foot piece of Samp son and I rappeled
down with the radio, a dry sweater, and a parachute harness.
John Payne from Green Bank met me at the bottom and we went to
where he and Ray Enyeart of the Pittsburg Explorers Club had been
waiting. Ray had been in the cave for thirty six hours and John for
14. Both were cold and hungry and the candy bars I gave them disappeared
like magic. After giving Ray the sweater, trying to talk to Phil over
the radio (I didn't stutter, the dumb thing wouldn't work), and
apopogizing to John for not bringing him a cold beer, we got Ray
into the harness; tooted twice on the whistle, and Ray was hauled up.
The rig came down, John climbed in and disappeared. Iwent up last
and really enjoyed ascending the drop without expending any energy.
We left the cave four hours after entering. Not too bad for a rescue,
On the way down to the cars, Ed explained to Ray about the Cave
Rescue Communications Network and the sequence of events that led
to his rescue, Ed had a little difficulty in explaining because Ray
had never heard of the National. Speleological Society.
