THE TECH TROGLODYTE
SPRING 1968
He scans enviously the
Calm face of the man
Moving
With sure hands the taut rope
About his body and
Becomes lost in reverie,
Crawls and stooping demand
No thought and only
The chill of the new spring night
Recalls him to the hidden lust
Of Achievement: "Will I be able...???
