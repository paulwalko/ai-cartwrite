THE TECH TROGLODYTE - SPRING 1968
Up to the crawlay the stream passage ma intains a rather uniform
height of seven or eight feet and a width of six to ten feet, About
a hundred feet before the crawlway is a thousand foot side passage
which branches off to the left. Being rather hurried we elected to
explore it at some other time, perhaps as we exited.
Finally the crawlway which CAVES OF WEST VIRGINIA lists as '
usually only slightly wat. We had apparently come at the time of
exception to the quote. Water roared over a waterfall, into a small
but deep pool, and swirled into the belly crawl. At this point we
came to the decision that an awful lot of equipment wasn't needed so we
left it there. Onward we crawled, squirmed, and gurgled for 150 feet
to emerge in a a canyon passage which emptied into the big room. The.
stream proceeded to plunge over the side in a rather awesome
spectacle hinting of more to come,
Spook directed us upward about fifty feet from the falls (known
quite aptly as Suicide Falls- octopus Laffoon trying, so it seemed,
to prove it). Following the upward passage for about 200 feet we
came to the rigging point. Here the passage is about six feet high
and you stand on nothing more solid than a breakdown plug. Tieing
onto a large rock and looping the rope around a stalagmite we prepared
to make our descent. Mike volunteered to go first and got down
without incident. Each of us followed and were on the bottom
within an hour. The falls was so full as to efficiently drown out
all conversation until we were several hundred feet down the passage.
However the passage itself made up for all lost words. During
the few seconds that the magnesium ribbons lit up the room you
could see the ceiling 180 feet above, the spectacular falls that in
130 feet hits the wall just once, and the enormous room that we
were in, One piece of breakdown on the floor was the size of a small
house.
Further down the passage Mike and Don began playing human fly
the rest of us turned to the right as the passage became smaller but
still quite imposing. We stopped here to browse through the cave
log. The ceiling height now became low and we had to duck, In
compensation, however, this area is decorated with hundreds of
formations of every type and color. It took a real effort to get
through the passage without breaking something.
Soon another well known obstacle confronted us- the Cat Crawl.
This wonderful little crawl forces one onto his belly and then
proceeds to soak him thoroughly. At the same time one acquires
an ample coating of very gooey mud. Oh, the joys of caving were
expounded at great length as we passed through the Cat Crawl.
beyond the crawl the passage continues for some 5,000 feet,
Several deep pools and large dome pits are found along the passage.
About two thousand feet beyond the Cat Crawl the upper passage
