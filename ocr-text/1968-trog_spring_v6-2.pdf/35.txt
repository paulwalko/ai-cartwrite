On the way back we went through Mud River. Everybody prussiked
out of the Canyon Roon and then Tom, Sharon, Terry and I headed for
the entrance leaving Mike, Don, and Phil to collect the ropes. When we
reached the Haystack Tom went on ahead so that we wouldn't freeze
waiting our turns to go up. Terry, Sharon, and I soon heard voices
so under the haystack we went to investigate. As it turned out, a
few fellow cavers had come by to see if we needed rescuing, which we
didn't. (It was nice of them anyway.) We cable-laddered up and were
all out of the cave at about 2:00 A.M. after having spent an enjoyable
nine hours in Clover Hollow, We celebrated our safe trip later by
downing a bottle of pink champagne,
CLOVER HOLLOW REVISITED
On Saturday, January 20, 1968, Steve Hall, Doug Perkins, Russ
Peterson, and myself took a trip to Clover Hollow Cave about fifteen
miles west of Blacksburg. We couldn't get Doug's Volkswagen up the
snow covered road to the cave so we parked it on the side of the main
road and hiked up, Steve Hall as usual didn't wea:* his cave clothes
so we had to wait for him to change in a little shack that was used
as a school bus stop.
Shortly we came to the sink hole entrance of the cave, Snow
melt was pouring into one side of the entrance in a medium sized stream
but we rigged the drop rope well away from it. We rigged a cable ladder
for the return ascent and rappeled the seventy foot entrance on a
doubled rope with single brake bar. At the bottom we pulled the rope
in after us and proceeded to explore the cave,
We soon came to a narrow V shaped slit in the rock that really
looked like a tihgt squeeze. Steve tried going through it and could
barely get by as small as he was. The rest of us finally managed to
get on the other side by crawling through a narrow passage that ran
under the V slit.
We then came to a twelve foot deep crack in the rock that was hairy
getting across to say the least. After rigging a handline over a
flowstone bank, we were at the tie-in place for the Grand Canyon Room.
At the tie-in point the ceiling is 150 feet overhead and the floor of
the room is 100 feet below. With a waterfall dropping off near the
tie-in, this roon is really an impressive sight. We rigged in and
made the rappel to the bottona, Â· Once down we made our first stop at
the Library Room. Anyone who has been to CI over Hollow will agree
that the Library has some of the best formations anywhere. (Ha!)
