E TECH TROGLODYTE - SPRING 1968
.
.
FIRST TRIP
FIRSL
Crouched at the edge of the pit,
Fingers gripping dust,
..Peering down on the second party
He waits
Tensely
In the face of the calm of the others.
Carbide flames streak
Yellow brushmarks on wall
and floor.
Dripping water and
Audible silence are drowned by :
Loud conversation between the groups,
Brittle clatter of falling rungs
Recalls him to memory of the endless
Wait for ttose below, seeing again
Slow crawls and climbs
Through which he again must go.
Sure hands rig and test the
Thin wire of the swaying ladder. The
Shadowy spider painted
Blackly on the wall releases its
Thin web of rope and it whispers
Dryly across the thin rungs,
Fascinated, he sees sure
Hands pass the line
Around
The body of a man who
Pulls at the knot and,
Adjusting the gloves upon his hands
Steps to the wall.
Sharp shouts of
Signal pass from top
to
Bottom: On belayi
Belay on! Climbing!
Climb He sees
Metal scrape rock as
The ladder pulls tight with weight.
