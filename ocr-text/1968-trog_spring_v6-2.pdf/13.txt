THE TECH TROGLODYTE - SPRING 1968
A protective caprock, provided it has not prevented the develop-
ment of a cave, serves well to stop erosion from destroying the cave.
In Burke's Garden, Tazewell County, we can see the remains of what
used to be a large system----Cassell Farm Cave, Within a few acres
there is over a mile of passage still underground, but it has been
carved into two separate sections by erosion. Anyone who has walked
up to Clark's Cave, on the other hand, is quite familiar with the
impervious shale caprock which overlies the cave, Likewise, visitors
to the Newberry-Bane's System are quite familiar with the red--
colored shaley escarpments standing above the entrances in the area. (See Fig.5
Caprock effects may be more far-reaching than this, however. .
lierial photographs of the Newberry's vacinity show a local prominence
on the ridge of Big Walker Mtn, just above the caves. For some
reason, the sandstone which caps the ridge has resisted erosion and
stands above the rest of it at High Rock Fire Tower. Spurs below
this prominence are larger and extend further into the valley to the
north. Penley's, Newberry-Banes, and Bane's Spring all lie under
these spurs. Perhaps Dragon's Tooth has a similar effect on Miller's
Cove Cave,
Closely associated with protective caprock is flai-lying
strata. We mentioned this factor in our Biscussion of urvern
development, but we are not being redundant. The reason :es back
to an old household saying---you may remember reading it on a
plaque above the stove in grandma's kitchen-- it $like this:
"The topographic.. potency of any given strata yari : ?versely with
its angle of inclination. Profound,? It simply Owns that if you
stand a layer of rock on end, it will wear away quicker than if you
let it lie flat... The beds out at Miller's Cove dip 45 degrees in
places. It needs a layer of hard sandstone to protect it. On the
other hand, James Cave may need only a gritty layer of dolomite to
stay around longer.
Now let's drag out this business of proper hydrologic conditions
again. Actually, the pattern a local drainage system takes has a
lot to do with whether or not the caves in the area will be a√ºtacked
by erosion. Mill Creek, for example, uses Slusser's Chapel Cave as
a trunk channel through a low ridge rather than cutting a gorge.
Walker Creek flows along a trench it has cut, causing its tributaries
to follow an underground route instead of cutting into the scenery,
New River, which Walker Creek feeds into, is also an entrenched stream,
The casual VPI Spelunker, who has borne with me thus far, may
perhaps be growing discouraged at all this "yes-but-well-maybe?
stuff because, being a practical person, his only interest in . . .
reading this article is so that he may gain some scrap of additional
insight which will help him discover a large system of his own. Hang on.
The redemption is coming.
We have continually sung the praises of good hydrologic
conditions as a factor of large cave development. Casual Spelunker
doesn't want a factor, he wants an indicator. Well, there is one
infallable indicator that all conditions are perfect for large.
vern development, one which even the most casual spelunker can
easily recognize. Even Phil Moritz would recognize it! Brace
yourselves; here it is: If there is already a known mile-long cave
