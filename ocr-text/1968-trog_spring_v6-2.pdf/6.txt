a smooth drop and rope burns assuming that precautions have been
taken (belays or chest safeties) against complete loss of control.
In some cases even standard safety precautions must give way.
On some drops, especially long free ones, a helay rope becomes
so entangled that a climber or rappeler cannot inove in either
direction. Horizontal caves can also be the nemesis of the ill
equipped. Last year two novices were fcund sleep in a popular horizontal
Cave near school. They had become lost even though one had been in
tie cave four times before. Three others had gone off in different
directions looking for the way out, Knowledge of the cave and any
difficulties which might be encounteród therein is a prerequisite
in the mental equipment of the trip leader. Expanding ones limits
in these directions is most easily accomplished through experience
but this should be gained in organized, grotto or private, training
se:sions and not at the expense of fellow cavers.

Responsibility for deciding who is within the physical, mental,
and mechanical limits ultimately rests on the shoulders of the
trip leo ufr or organizer but there are those who rarely say no to
anyone. These are frequently the same ones who should not venture

of the limited which has the potential to cause serious rescu-
problems.
This article is aimed mainly at the new cayer and trainee

members of caving organizations who have not given serious thougiit
