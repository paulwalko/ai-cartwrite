THE TECH TROGLODYTE - SPRING 1968
difficult, hairy move; they just move. And mud, hell, I figured they'd
all start to moran about their clothes and hair when they got dirty.
Dut no, the giris love it, the more the merrier (mud, that is).
(They do complain about their hard-hats getting dirty though, it
covers up all the flowers.)
And they do add a little sparkle to cave trips. How can you
help but laugh when a girl pulls out a pack of Kleenex to clean her
glasses when she's knee adeep in mud. Or, after setting up camp, she

They do add some problems to overnight trips though, such as no
gas stations close by, and irate cave-Owner's wives who just know
tiere's all sorts of sinnin' going on. But, on the whole, the girls
are real additions to the Club, so I retract my prejudice against
girl cavers. And I know that the ciut wil by 'n (oprs) none it
