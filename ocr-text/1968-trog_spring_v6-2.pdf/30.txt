THE TECH TROGLODYTE - SPRING 1968
Morgan posed for a few shots but I hardly thihk; that they'll make .
SPORTS ILLUSTRATED. After some "fun"? climbing we came to a deep fissure
that Ed had explored before. We chimneyed down mapping all the way. At
the bottom a stream passage pushed into the darkness. We followed the
stream until we came to a section of. quite large rooms. From here on
the cave was all running and appeared to be virgin. While rest kept
mapping, Dave NicCloy and I walked through the big rooms completely
thrilled. In what appeared to be the last big room were three leads.
One was behind a huge formation and this we checked. Directly behind the
big formation were the most intricate rimstone dams that either of
us had ever seen. The crawl got a bit tight in places and even filled
with water in others but beyond we could hear the rumbling of a huge
waterfall that pulled us on.
After a while the passage appeared to get a bit bigger and by now
the waterfall was a roar. Beyond the passage was about three feet high
and had a swift current of water running through it. Here we decided
to go back. We never made it to the falls but shall try damn hard
next time.
The big rooms had quite a few leads heading off in all directions,
some with drafts. We all agreed that we'd come back some day soon. After
we reached the entrance room and changed we packed into Ed's car. We
were very drousy and the only thing that kept us awake was the fact
that Ed kept drifting into the left lane. He was so tired!
Although it was hard, I did fall asleep. When I awoke for an
instant we weren't moving and all I could hear was a stream. I went
back to sleep. Ed had stopped to get a few hours rest. The next
time I awoke we were very near Blacksburg. It took me a few days
to get back my natural curly energy and soon I was as negative as ever.

EILEEN OVER BACKWARDS
The original plan was to go to Miller's Cave but when a Land
Rover gets stuck, the gods are trying to tell you something. So we
decided to invade Newberry's. Tom picked a likely swamp to park the
Rover and suddenly Vigour recognized the only other vehicle in sight.
It belonged to Sara Correy--yes folks, Sara Correy-- a legend in her
own time. We followed the tracks through the snow up the hill all the
while trying to figure out a reasonable explanation for the strange
tracks. When we got to the entrance and saw the snow saucer we said,
**Aha!" What a clevez way to carry rope to a cave! (No, we didn't
connect it at all with the funny tracks. If we were bright enough to
see the connection there, we wouldn't have been going caving in the i
