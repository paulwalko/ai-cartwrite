THE TECH TROGLODYTE - SPRING 1968
THE CALCULUS OF CAVING
An integral part of the great sport of spelunking which too
many cavers seem to forget, or intentionally overlook, is that of knowing
ones limits and being able to differentiate between which caves he
is capable of exploring and those for which he is not equipped either
physically, mentally, or mechanically.. This does not mean he cannot
vecome so equipped, but it does imply that every caver, before i
embarking on a subterranean journey, should take time for introspection.
All of us know, or have known people who include themselves
on trips which are too difficult or too long for their present
capabilities. This is especially true in the case of a student
grotto which has a great reservoir oi inexperienced personnel to
whom caving is a once or twice a year activity. These perons will
shok up agassionally at grotto meetings, sometimes for lock of
something else to do, and seeing how casually a darger25 trip is
recounted, deciile therefore that it is within their !imits nid get
into trouble when they attempt the same trip. What the rail to
reciize is that caving, like any other sport, comes námural y to
some but takes practice. In che same respect, the ability to become
a good caner can never be achieved ny others. The purson with astoma
shouli avoid long or strenuous trips as dictated t o severity of
qis illness. An attack deep underground can turn ä meine excursion
into a rescue operation. Similar applications can be trade to other
such disorders,
Although modern safety practices, rope work, and vertical
techniques often permit it, the conscientious overweigh person
shouid realize his position in a caving party and should try to
clit down on his excess or replace it with muscle. If not willing to
make this sacrificcra he should restrict himself to slow or Shirt
tries with those who don't mind the delay. The fat (why avoid the
word 091? longer) cayer is a hindrance on long or vertical trips as
me tires quickly and more easily. This fatigue may sap him of the strength
reeded on a long climb or prusik. Since Axpeditions of this nature
U slálly consist of a small group, help is not always readily available
aiid the trip is ruined for the other participants as well as being
enterrassing for the exhausted party. No one can be a mountain goat
with a twenty pound posterior counterweight and nothing gets stuck
ir a crawlway quite as well as a spare tire, Plan accordingly.
Mentally equipped, this refers to many aspects of spelunki1:8:
A know.edge of ropes and splicing for rope work, how to rappel,
how to beíay, where and what is safe to tie in to, how to safely
crimo a cable ladder, and how to prusik or use umars etc. in
verticalork. Many new cavers enter into the port under the
impression that the only way to ascend a rope is hand-over-hand.
It was icbempted in Hellhole, West Virginia, but...
Knowing how many brake bars or turns on a rappel spool are needed
