this presents a definite problem.. to the caver,
There are a couple of things that a caver can do about rabies,
One is ignoring the threat, and the other is taking prophylactic
(ed, note, ?) treatment. With this in mind, I started looking
into the treatment of the disease, and found a "new: duck embryo
vaccine that was availabee, and decided to take it. The duck embryo
vaccine has been around for eleven years, and seems to be quite
effective,
There has been much said for and against the use of preventive
rabies vaccine. Wayne H. Davis reports that the staff of the
Southwest Rabies Investigation Station of University Park, N.M., uses
preventive vaccine with yearly boosters (2), The Eli Lily Company,
makers of the vaccine which I used, reccomends;
Vaccination with duck-embryo vaccine before exposure occurs may
be d√©sirable for certain high-risk individuals. These include
veterinarians, deliverymen, meter readers, spelunkers, laboratory
personnel working with rabies virus, and perhaps others,
It took a while to get hold of the vaccine, I was told by a
doctor and two druggi sts, (one of whom referred me to a feed store to
get the vaccine for my animals), that preventive rancine was not to be

and directing dosage and administration, after I convinced the doctor.
that the vaccine was available for people as well as dogs. After
hearing many horror stories of bad effects of the rabies vaccine,
("they take this big needle and jab you right in the stomach, 'every

and then getting the shots,
I discussed the treatment with one of the doctors on the staff .

them as a private patient. He allowed me to take them at the infirmary,
and thus saved me a bill.. My only cost was the vaccine charge, I
went to the local drug store, convinced the druggest that there was
such an item available, and had four packages of vaccine the next day, at
a cost of two dollars a dose. Next stop was the infirmary, where I.
filed the vaccine in the refrigerator, and took a half dose,

administration, (powered vaccine and distilled water), and then given

series I was held in the waiting room for a short while to see if
anything would happen. This was something new for the doctor, and he
was taking great care that he see everything involved. I became an
