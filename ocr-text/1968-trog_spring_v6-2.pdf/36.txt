THE TECH TROGLODYTE . SPRING 1968
The next few hours. were spent in a fruitless search for the
bottom of the Andrews Room, Once we got to a point at the top of the
room and another time we were at a point half way up but we could never
actually get to the bottom. During the course of events we managed
to make the wonderful crawl through the Mud River twice. Finally
with everyone bone tired and out of drinking water we decided to climb
out of the Canyon Room and start toward the surface,
Russ, Steve, and Doug all had climbing cams while I was blessed
with a brand new set of prusiks. I started up the rope first and
naturally, as is my usual case, ran into trouble, About seventy feet
off of the floor my prusiks started slipping. After a hairy ten minute
interval where I moved the amazing distance of five feet, I finally got
the knots working right again but not before I dropped my right hand
glove to the floor. As a result, I got to the top of the drop with
some pretty grimy looking rope burns on my fingers,
Steve Hall came up next and had trouble with his cams slipping.
Once up he discovered that the teeth were nearly worn off of his two
cans, Doug and Russ made the ascent with no trouble and were ready to
start back to the entrance,
After retracing the obstacle course we went through coming into
the cave, we were finally back at the entrance room. Now the only thing
that stool between us and the surface was that severity foot ladder climb--
Owl my achin' arms! Nobody wanted to stand very long in the cold
spray from the waterfall coming from the surface though and we were all
up the ladder in record time... We got back to the cars in the general
vicinity of 3:00. A.M. Sunday morning having stayed a total of twelve
hours in the cave,

CASS
Beside the fact that we were eight hours late in getting to
the cave, things went rather well. After digging our clothes out
of the three cars, we quickly tested the ropes and headed for the entrance
of Cass, Bob (Spook) Swensson did the honors of guiding us (Mike Kayes,
Don Laffoon, Phil Moritz, Gary Moss, Tom Roehr, and Chris White) atleast
until the drop.
The entrance of Cass was apparently formed by the collapse of both
ends of a small room. A stream enters the cave and leads the way
down the first 750 feet of walking passage. There being several
inches of snow on the ground and the temperature above freezing, this
small stream was quite full and very cold, Not knowing what lay ahead
we all took pains to keep out boots and packs dry.
