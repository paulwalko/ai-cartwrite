9 TECH TROGLODITE . SPRING 1968
Although fairly easy to improvise, detailed instructions for ..
building the cam are given in the November 1965 NSS NEWS. A set
of three cams can be assembled for about three dollars with hammer,
hacksaw, drill, and file,
Unlike prusiks and other mechanical ascenders which require
the hands to raise them, the climbing cam can be completely manipulated
by the feet leaving the hands free to light a cigaret, hold a book's
or pet bats as you go by. The best way that I have found is to tie
a cam onto the instep side of each boot with one inch nylon webbing
for comfort. The method of climbing will be discussed later on.
The positive holding power of the cam is one of its main assets.
The cams which I use have sma 1.1 teeth (lateral hacksaw. blade grooves
spaced 1/8 inch apart) which cause very little, if any, wear on the
rope and have given me traction on wet, muddy, and ice covered ropes.
I have even heard of an instance where a person climbed a metal rod
using cams. Despite the amount of grip when weight is applied, the
mere removal of that weight is enough to unlock the cam so that it
can be advanced. The increasing radius of the cam itself nearly
prohibits downward slipping but it is possible to li came down the rope
if the need arrises.
Versatility is another great advantage of the cam. . Not only can
it be tied to the foot but also may be attached to Å¿ings and be used
in place of prusik or related knots, be equipped with a spring and
used like Jumars, or be used as a chest safety while rappeling. One .
outstanding quality of the can which I have found is its use as a
safety on the first man up a ladder or chimney where a rope has
previously been rigged but is not long enough for a pulley belay from
below. Attached to the chest harness or seat sling, the can rides
smoothly up the rope almost unnoticed by the climber until he needs
it for a rest or belay.
Climbing with the cam can be as varied as one wants. I, myself,
prefer a three cam rig- one attached to each foot and one as a chest
safety clipped also into a seat sling for comfort when resting.
Ascent is accomplished by raising one foot, setting the cam by an out
and down foot movement and bringing the other can up to the first, then
repeating. The chest cam rides up like a pulley holding the upper
pact of the body to the rope, Plausibly an entire climb could be
made without using the arms but when they are used to hold the body
in a more upright position, the legs dont' have to fight the excess
friction caused by the bend in the rope at the point of the chest
can. Another method which I frequently use, especially on long
climbs, is to set the chest cam, bring both feet up at the same time,
then stand up; thus inch-worming up the rope, Hanging from the chest
cam gives the legs a chance to rest for a second or two. With very
little practice I have been able to ascend twenty feet per minute on
drops up to 120 feet.
