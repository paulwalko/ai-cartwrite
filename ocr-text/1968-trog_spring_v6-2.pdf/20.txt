TROGLCDE
- SPRING 1968

My Sunday was made for me by watching Holsinger and Stellmack
struggle up off my dorm-room floor at 7 am in order to attend a
WVACS meeting in Lewisburg.
I think that everybody involved with the Board meeting had a
great time and we look forward to hosting another one sometime or
another.

One warning- Jack Stellmack snores like a Honda Super-90 winding out
in low so think twice before putting him up when he
comes calling.

CAMALOT
Since the November, 1965 issue of the NSS NEWS hit the mails,
prusiking has become obsolete. In this issue there came to the general
caver's eye Ã  new ascender within the range of every ruddy wallet and
capable of out performing" the knots in almost every respect. If
you have not already guessed the name of this revolutionary mechanism,
it is called the "climbing cam. Presumably invented by Robert E.
Henshaw and David F, Morehouse of the Iowa Grotto, the cam opperates
on a principle similar to the Jumar in having an offset cam which
tightens on the rope as downward pressure is applied, but here the
similarity stops,
Basically the cam consists of a piece of 1/8 inch aluminum or
steel plate bent into a U shape through which the rope slides. The
plate should be formed around a 1/2 inch metal rod so that it will
accomodab? any rope up to that diameter,: Larger sizes could also
plausibly be made if it is anticipated that water swollen 1/2 inch
rope may at some time be used. The rope is kept in the trough by
the cam which pivots on a pin piercing both sides of the U. Downward
pressure on the outer part of the cam causes it to press the rope
tightly against the plate thus holding the climber in position.
The cam itself is fashioned out of 1/2 inch aluminum or steel stock.
Its cortact surface can be smooth, knurled, or have teeth and may be
flat or have a wounded groove cut with a rat-tail file giving a
larger friction area and less single point rope wear.
I have found that the best way of securing he pin is by drilling
a hole through the end and inserting a cotter clip. This not only.
allows the pin to pivot, which is not possible with a threaded pin,
but the clip can be used over and over again and not foul with mud
as the conventional cotter pin does.
