ARIZONA CAVING
On arriving in Arizona I consulted a few issues of the UAAC
NEWSLETTER and found a few cavers living less than two miles from my
home in Sierra Vista, The person that I later went caving with was
Jim Cobb of the UAAC Grotto. When I asked him about the possibility
of a caving trip he suggested that we go to Onyx Cave. In his estimation
Onyx is the best cave in Arizona.
After waiting out the worst Arizona storm in sixty-six years we
finally found a day on which we felt safe at trying to get to the cave,
The cave is situated near Madera Canyon about thirty-five miles from
Sierra Vista. It was, without a doubt, the hardest time I ever had
getting to a cave, After driving down a closed dirt road for six miles
fording occasional wa shouts, we cane to where the road fords a stream
that is usually dry. With the large snow storm just over the stream was
rushing and the ford and parts of the road around it no longer existed.
Jim parked the car and we proceeded walking down the stream looking
for a place to cross it. After crossing the stream we had to walk
about another mile keeping out of the way of the wild pigs that were
running around.
After a while we had to cross the stream again. This time we
decided not to waste time looking for a place to walk across it and
proceeded to rig a Tarzan type swing of Goldline from a tree overhanging
the stream. After I rigged the rope Jin went across and I tossed him
the equipment. Now it was my turn. I made it across but not without
getting wet to my waist, From here we climbed a hill to the unique
entrance to Onyx Cave.
The natural entrance to the cave which was about three feet
square had been gated by filling with concrete except for a hole about
a foot square. At one time there had been a swinging iron door which
could be locked but eager cayers had since blown it off and only the
concrete remains,
Onyx Cave had a little bit of everything. It has a fifteen foot
entrance pit and another. pit later on called "The Gorgere. Its largest
drop is a 150 foot dead end pit which we didn't bother with. Using
a 250 foot and 200 foot Goldline we rigged both sides of both pits
and used them as climbing aids. Double rope rigs were used everywhere
so that the rope could be removed and used later on in the cave,
Ropework in Onyx includes a necessary ability to lasso formations.
This was my first encounter with this type of rigging since most of
our rigging in Virginia is of a fixed, single rope style. On the way
out of the cave a double double rope was used to traverse the gorge.
Onyx bave has many beautiful formations. The most striking and
the most beautiful formations that I have ever seen were the walls full
of helectites, some over six inches long. The cave was literally
