B.O.G. AT B'BURG
On April 20, 1968 the NSS Board of Governors held their semi-
annual meeting hosted, more than adequately, by the VPI Grotto on
the Blacksburg campus: of Virginia Tech. The business covered
ranged from formal announcement of the 1969 convention site (no
comment) to taking Boy Scouts caving, to Don Cournoyer's proposal
of a dues increase,
Most of the Board members arrived Friday evening and were
treated to a VPI grotto mountain top speleo-seminar which they all
seemed to enjoy.
Following Saturday supper another speleo seminar was held at
the home of Dr. David A. West, our faculty advisor. Dr, West entertained
everybody by talking to Russ Gurnee who had to look up to him (Doc
is 6o 90e). Many people attended the party and many new friendships were
made. All of us enjoyed the opportunity of talking to Board members
and other Society officers present. Julia Day gave this editor
some useful hints on publishing news letters and informed us of
quadrangle maps available from the USGS in exchange for our publication,
The party was a sma shing success despite a visit by Blacksburg
rednecks who deflated many tires, and John Cooper's ego.
