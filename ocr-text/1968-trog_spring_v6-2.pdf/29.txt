THE TECH TROGLODYTE - SPRING 1968
TRIP REPORTS
The trip report has become an integral part of almost every
publication put out by a caving organization. Before a person can
realize full membership in the VPI Grotto he must submit an article,
preferably suitable for printing, to the TECH TROGLODYTE staff.
dany trainees fulfill this obligation through the writing of a trip
report, several of which follow. The subscriber to this journal may
notice the large amount of repetition in the caves chosen for these
reports. This is due to the fact that most of the caves mentioned
are the "old standards to which most prospective members travel at
one time or another. The editors seek to include specific trip reports
not only for variety of caves when possible, but also to portray the
human element which is a necessary contributor to every trip.
The TECK TROGLODYTE now proudly presents another thrilling
episode in its never ending struggle against literary excellence,

as they actually happened" by the true participants in the real life
dramas

you who have tasted the sweet nectar of caving..."Go to hell...and
Bon appetit:
Besides my trip to Banes where I was attacked by Ã  lusty cricket, I
suppose my most interesting trip was to Jessie's, Ed Morgan tied us
up, loaded us into his car, and, with shouts of delight, whisked us off
to Jessie's Cave. At the cave entrance he untied us and Dave McCloy
bit him in the leg. After we assured him that Dave wasn't rabid, we
loaded ourselves with gear and entered the cave. We changed in the
entrance room despite Bob. Lewis' wierd behavior. Then we pushed through
the cave and began mapping where we had left off. I got out of most
of the work by running around flashing my camera at the others, Ed
