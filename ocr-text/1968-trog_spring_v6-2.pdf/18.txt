THE TECH TROGLODYTE
SPRING 1968

I don't know what made these people go into Cass when they were
not equipped for the cave and not capable of that type of caye.
Evidently they did not ask anybody about the cave or they wouldn't
have rigged it with a ladder. I don't know about the rest of the group,
but Ray had never heard of prusiking....
I guess people get overconfident and will tackle a cave that
they have no business in and sometimes get into trouble. If they would
stop and THINK and ask somebody who is familiar with the cave and
knows what the problems are, things wouls be better off all around.

OVERHEARD AT THE SPELEO-SEMINAR
The Speleo-seminarâ€œ has long been an institution af caving
organizations throughout the world and the VPI Grotto wishes to be
no exception. Steeped in tradition, the Friday night get-together has
become the Mecca where Cave Club members journey to relax after the strict
formal disciplines of the grotto meeting. Trip plans for the weekend
are solidified, melodic voices pierce the innocent night air to the
strumming of guitar or banjo, and the major topics of the day are
thrown up for discussion, Truly it is at such gatherings that the
caver becomes "himself".
