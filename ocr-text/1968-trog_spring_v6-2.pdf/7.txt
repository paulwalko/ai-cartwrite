THE TECH TROGLODYTE - SPRING 1968
vierently poolspelunker should be excluded from the organization
but, indeed, tlirough the exercising of logic disguised as common
sense he can make a place for himself in the grotto and cave club
structure, Conversely, the grotto has the responsibility of
channeling his efforts along the proper subterranean paths so that
the final derivative is safe and enjoyable caving for all members,

VIRGINIAIS BIG CAVES
Three years ago the Winter 165 TECH - TROGLODYTE carried an
article oli caves over one mile long in Virginia. The list contained
thirteen caves 'nown at the time to have atleast one aile of passage,
Since then the list has more than doubled itself. It is interesting

Compiling this list has aroused an interest in the occurrence
of large cave systems in Virginia and has prompted aome inquiry
into factors conducive to their development. Although not conclusive,
these results have been published here as they may provide food
for thought to the casual VPI speluriker.
To hogin with, there are two factors which must exist i...?
area beícre large caves can be found there. In addition to conditions
which develop the cave system there must also be conditions which
preserve it. It is possible to have such efficient development
conditions that an entire exposure of cavernous rock will be
Chemically eroded away. This condition prevails along the eastern
odge of the Valley and Ridge Province where the Shady dolomite
czerlies the Erwin quartzite, Runoff descending along the relatively
1 pervious quartzite encounters the outcrop face of the soluable
hady and leaches it out to great depths. Whatever caves once existed
there have long since become clay fills or valleys. (See Fig.1) So
we see that development is only half of the picture. The system must
also be protected from the ravages of time,
Let us first consider some of the possit. factors which
