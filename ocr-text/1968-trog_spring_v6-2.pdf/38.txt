ends and one climbs down into the lower stream passage. This passage
ends in a series of deep pools which finally blocked our further
progr√§ss. At this point one is directly beneath but some forty feet
lower than the big room,
Retracing our steps made us wonder if the cave had grown since
we last passed through. The Cat Crawl passed, we rejoined Mike
and Don and proceeded to the bottom of the drop. After a makeshift
lunch from rather squashed cans (see what happens when you free fall
& can 180 feet), Tom started up. Some four hours later I, the last
of six, began climbing. Never be the last if you can help it-you
spin. Mike and I hauled up the packs and proceeded out arriving at
the entrance about five in the morning and some fifteen hours after
entering,
Tom and Mike headed right for Washington while the rest of
us headed up to the PSC Fieldhouse slowed only by a thick fou,
pouring rain, and a lack of gas in Phil's car,

B.C. CAVERNS
BY: STEELMAN"
To cut through the usual pre-cave verbosity, we entered B.C.
Caverns late in the morning after a very eventful drive from Blacksburg.
I need say only that the Rocket was in rare form,
The Entrance is a small fissure about two feet long and seven
inches wide. After wriggling in and soon emerging at the famous
Entrance Room, we picked our way down the Stream Passage. After
about 2359 feet the stream finally ducked under a rock and disappeared.
As most of you who have been here remember, this signals the beginning
of A Crawlway. A Crawlway, with its cave coral floor and walls,
was a real relief for our aching bodies after the tortuous Stream
Passage. Especially since everyone knew that only seventy-three
feet away was the Trunk Channel. Soon all in our party emerged
from A Crawlway and sat down at one side of the Trunk Channel for
a cigarette. It was at this point that I showed the rest of the
party the pads which protected my knobby knees from the lacerations
and abrasions which they were now nursing.
Soon we were off on the second leg of our trip. I wanted to
go downstream almost to The Syphon, turn off at The Sewer Passage
and check some leads in The Formation Section, Little did I know
what we would get into on this trip! Golly, golly.
Q. How is the Cave Club different form a VPI fraternity?
A. Your friends didn't cost $100.00.
