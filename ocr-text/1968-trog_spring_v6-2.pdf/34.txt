CE TR0017NYTE - SPRING 1968
covered with white helectites filling large wall areas and almost every
crack with their twisted forms,
Jim and I didn't see the whole cave since both of us were rather
wet, but Jim says that the back of the cave has large formations
over ten feet in diameter.

THAT CLOVER HOLLOW FEELING
On January 13, 1968, Mike Kayes, Don Laffoon, Sharon Priest, Tom
Vigour, Terry Pick, and myself, Arabia Benitez, decided to go caving.
It was one of those last minute Let's gop trips. We were all gathered
at Owens commenting on the snow storm raging outside and enjoying the
warmth of being indoors. Tom Vigour was emphatically saying that only
a fool would go caving on such a day yet, a few diehards were wanting to
go, Terry kept deciding and undeciding to go caving and then someone
mentioned Clover Hollow-- that was the catalyst! F9:1 decided to go
because it was the crazy thing to do, then Mike and Don decided to
join the trip in order to promote National Library week and all the
while Vig sat back shaking his head telling us what fools we were and
how we were going to freeze. But the insanity was contagious and even
Tom couldn't resist, Little did Sharon, who was faithfully attending
class, know or expect that she'd be going caving in a blizzard-- she'd
soon find out.
Everyone scrambled off to get their gear which included novel
additions to the library and off we went into the white and drifting
snow, We stopped off at Radford Brothers for some candy bars. We
got to the cave without too much trouble except that Mike managed to
lead us half way up the wrong mountain. We tried to get the cars
nearer to the entrance of the cave but the snow and the wooden bridge
wouldn't permit it,
At the entrance we rigged in a cable ladder and the rappeling
rope. Once in the cave we fueled our lamps and ate some candy bars
and started caving. At the flowstone we rigged a rope and brought it
over the 15 foot drop also that we could rappel that drop too, Ton gave
a couple of bats artificial respiration--I hope they survived! At the
Canyon Room the drop was rigged double and down Mike and Ton whizzed
to Tori's mighty AAAA-EEEEEEEEE-MAAAAA, It was a fun rappel for all.
Phil, Sharon, and Terry went into the Thistle Tube anf made alot
of noise coming out. We then went and completed our appointment in
the Library with time out for a reading break.
