invalid).
They are:
1. Flat-lying strata
2, Massive, pure carbonates
3. Development in synclinal trough's
4. Proper hydrologic conditions
We shall now examine each of the proposed factors. In considering
flat-lying (or otherwise undisturbed) strata, a quick glance across
the state line into West Virginia offers many good examples. Greenbrier
Caverns, McClungs, Greenville Saltpeter, Friar's Hole, and many.
other large systems are developed in very low dip limestone, In
strata such as this, the cave passages are free to develop in whatever
direction the local hydrology dictates. (See Fig.2) In dipping
limestone, stratigraphic barriers of shale, snadstone, or chert.
limit development of the system to the strike line. (See Fig.3)
Massive pure carbonates seem to aid in cavern formation
because they offer no internal resistance to drainage. This, however
is usually not a critical condition. In steeply dipping strata
Cives are less choosy about what kind of limestone they {?? in.
The size of the passage is apt to be smaller however.
If a cave is developed in a synclinal trough is likely
to be large. Ground water descends down the limbs the flata:
lying axis where it flows along the trough to an exit somewhere.
Oli, yes, there must be an exit. Good examples of this are Butler's
in Bath County and Flannery's in Scott County. (See Fig.4)
The need for an exit at one end of the synclinal trough
points up the fourth condition. As the astute reader probably
noticed in the original list, the first three factors are quite
subjective. They all deal with facts which can be readily determined.
Conditioni four, however, is never quite so obvious but without it
the first three will never make a cave regardless of how nearly
ideal they are. In order for a large cave system to develop,
thsre must be ( or must have existed in the past) a condition
such that enough water has flowed underground for a long enough
time and distance for the cave to form. The other three conditions
cited merely add frosting to the cake.
But how does one determine whether or not the hydrologic
conditions are right? Large volumes of water sinking into or
resurging from limestone may offer a clue. Maps showing a sinkhole
plain above incised drainage may help, provided the karst is not
20 mature.
This brings us to the second set of condicions mentioned at
to ou at-- those such that once a system is developed, it will
be preserved. Some of these factors are:
