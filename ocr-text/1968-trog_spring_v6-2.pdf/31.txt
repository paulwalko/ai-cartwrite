winter in the C#$%&* snow and mud and cold.) Before I go any further
I suppose I should point out that the trip was led by Tom Vigour, Ton
Roehr, and Jim Dawson. The rest of the party consisted of ne, Eileen
Aldridge, Since Sara was in shouting distance of the entrance, we
got permission to rappel into the cave on the rope that she had used
since it was already tied in. We net her just a short way in front of the
Straddle fit. She was trying to find a familiar rock to tie in with. .
(By the way, some guy naned Ted from Cincinnatti was with her.) He
hopped over the Straddle Pit and zipped down the twelve foot drop
after thinking ahead and tying a thirty foot cable ladder for the return
tri?. Now for the best part-. the 1801 Sara had 210 feet of half inch
Samson. Good ol' Sara. She had an interesting rig, a handy-dandy
little rappeling spool. (It was about as "handy-dandys as any piece
of lead pide can be with big corkscrews on either end.) About here
I'd like to take a short break and editorialize, "White Lightning?
is a misnomer. It did make for a slow, scenic, worry free rappel.
I had both hands free to write on the wall, destroy formations, knit,
or whatever I felt like, I could regulate the speed by how fast I
stuffed rope through my double brake-bar rig. I had plenty of time
to look for candles and appreciate the rappel at the same time. On the
whole, however, I was dissatisfied with the overall impression of
"White Lightninge, so Tom Roehr and I decided to climb the Devil's
Staircase and do the 180 with a single brake bar. dieanwhile Vig rolled
his own and chatted with Moose. The second time with a single was
much more enjoyable. I was falling of my own weighe just a few feet
fron the top all the way to the bottom. It was great!
We ran to the Vault Room, looked at the Triple Wells, and headed
back to the bottom or the 180. Fron there it was back up the Devil's
Staircase. After doing that twice in one day I'm never going to speak
to another piece of breakdown. "Richie's Delight--isn't that the
spot, that we crawled through that was big as a bread box? In Matthew
19:24, it says that,"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye.
of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kindom of God." I
don't know about you, but I think that I could come up with a better
analogy than the Biblical writers. At least, one we could all identify
with. From the top of the Devil's Staircase we backrappeled forty-five
feet to the top of the 180. We climbed the cable ladder, hopped back
across the Straddle Pit, and found ourselves at the bottom of the seventy
foot entrance drop. Vig climbed out first using a climbing car as
a belay. He then belayed me while I chirneyed out with Roehr and
Moose climbing out right behind me. The best thing about the trip
was the fact that we went down 307 feet (532 if you did the 180 and
the back rappel twice) and we didn't have to prussik one inchi
After we changed in the Rover (it was a little easier for some
of us--all we had to do was pull off coveralls) we proceeded to the
Dublin Truck Stop which is actually the Ranch House Restaurant,
but don't ask..
Now that all is said and done, my only remark is--"Everything's
