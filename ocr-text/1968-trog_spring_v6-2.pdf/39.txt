THE TECH TROGLODYTE - SPRING 1968
33
At The Formation Section, so named because of its absolute
lack of formations, we paused and admired the simple beauty of walls
unencumbered by dripstone, My gaze was suddenly interrupted by a
small stalagmite over in a corner which had previously escaped my
attention. Outraged by this anomalous destruction of the room's symmetry,
I promptly covered it with a carbide dump, announcing to the trainee
present that this would serve as his conservation trip. After all,
we had single-handedly preserved both the name and the perfection
of The Formation Section,
The first lead I wanted to check was off to our left, just
beyond The Rock Organ-a piece of breakdown named for its resemblance
to an electric piano. The exploration of this lead proved to take
up all the time we had allotted ourselves for exploration on this
trip. Unfortunately, the section was not virgin, for there was one
set of foo prints leading in; however there were none leading out, so
I guess one could say the lead was "almost virgin. The passage soon
opened up into a wide flat stream channel with a sandy floor and
a fair sized 7,1 stream winding on down, We soon encountered a
beautiful formation on the wall. It looked exactly like an extremely
large human gall bladder fashioned in stone. However, since there
is already one Rock Organ in the cave, we decided to leave it name.
less to avoid confusion,
After we passed The Nameless, the passage changed character. Soon
we were climbing over breakdown and happing from rock to rock,
always led on by that tantalizing set of foot prints, Further on,
on sandy floor again, a mountain of breakdown loomed over us. The
breakdown was composed of rocks about the size of basketballs and
completely filled the passage, which was about thirty feet by thirty
feet at this point,
I sat down and ate a Charlie Maus Varigated Life Wafer while the
others made a preliminary search for a way over or around the break-
down. It was then that I noticed the name "Arne Saknussum' written
on the wall. I guess that was the guy in here ahead of us, whoever
he may be. The others reported that they couldn't find a way past
the breakdown. Then, almost simultaneously, we all noticed the now
familiar set of footprints leading straight into the breakdown.
After a quick poll we decided to call this The Terminal Breakdown
and get the hell out. We took off on a quick exit" type of trip-
past The Nameless, up The Fair Sized Stream, out of The Lead, over
The Rock Organ, through The Formation Section, out The Sewer Passage,
up The Trunk Channel, through A Crawlway, over, under, around, and
through Dhe Stream Passage, into The Entrance Room and, finally,
out The Entrance, Pant, pant.
So ended the trip in which The One Way Street was entered-named
because of the expression, "Life is a one way street. I have found
out since that trip that the owner has found it necessary to relocate
his outhouse. Unfortunately he decided the most logical location would
be right over that twenty-four by seven inch fissure in his yard-the.
entrance to B.C. Caverns. Oh well, at least that justifies the full name
of the cave--Buntcha Crapp Caverns,
