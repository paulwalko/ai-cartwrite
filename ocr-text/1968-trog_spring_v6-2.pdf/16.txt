THE TECH TROGLODYTE - SPRING 1968
13
It is strange to note that many girls have a latent fondness of getting
muddy and Floe indulged herself while the rest of us couldn't help
it, I knew that she was going to make a good caver. I was not so
sure of Max, though, for he kept ducking and dodging as we walked down
the seventy foot high Cathedral Passage. Since there were no bats
around to cause such action, I asked him what was wrong. He said.
that he kept imagining he saw rocks falling from the ceiling.
Rhimston, a psychology major, at once realized that Max was suffering
from a speleo syndrome more commonly referred to as mental breakdown.
His fears calmed somewhat, Max resumed his quest for an anti-
cline, Arriving at the stream, he felt that his search was at an
end as he triumphantly pointed to a formation of brown, erroded rock,
Deciding that it was time for another geology lesson, I paused to
explain that this formation was not anticline, but was, in fact, chert.
The convoluted pattern in it is caused as water washed over it and
slowly wears it down. In effect it could be called a wash and wear
chert.
The Serpentine Way and finally the First Siphon were conquered
by our intreped group so we started out. Before we left the stream
passage, I stopped to dump in a small container of Listerine,
**Don't you mean flourescene, asked Harry. No, L.-...-1ne, for you
see, Breathing Cave has bat-breath. That was too ' for him and
all he could do was throw up in disgust-his hands. Crawling through
cave passages while patting yourself on the back is difficult but
I managed,
We spent a little time in the historic section looking for the
famed Nasal Passage which leads to a sinuous cavity of Breathing
Cave and finally left. After breaking camp we returned to Tech
through Covington and Clifton Forge, As we drove through Rainbow
Gorge I pointed to that long, arching outcrop and stated, We've
finally come to the antic.line, Max."
