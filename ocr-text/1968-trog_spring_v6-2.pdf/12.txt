THE TECH TROGLODYTE - SPRING 1968
1. Immature karst
2. Proximity to a drainage divide
3. Protective caprock
4. Flat-lying strata
5, Proper hydrologic conditions
The most common destroyer of the cave is erosion. Immature
karst is not really a factor but rather an indicator that erosion
has not yet had time to destroy the caves. Proximity to a drainage
divide usually means that an area has not been as vigorously attacked
by erosion as the same beds of limestone further down stream.
In Sinking Creek Valley, Craig County, Virginia, a drainage divide
lies across the valley between Sinking Creek Mountain and John's
Creek ivountiin. Large caves in the area seem to cluster around
this divide (Rufe Caldwells, Newcastle Murder Hole, etc.) Further
down the valley there is a dearth of caves until the stream cuts
over into another valley. In Tazewell County, Stonley's Cave
almost straddles the divide between the Tennessee Valley and the Ohie
Valley, In Mongcnery County, Slusser's Chapel Cave ca: nies water
under the apparent: surface divide fron the Ohio Valley in :n the
Roanoke Valley. On the other hand, most of us are familia with
the hundreds of small "rat holes to be found in limestone bluffs
overlooking large streams.
In Virginia cave country, we are basically des with five
drainage basins, The Potomac basin drains northeast into the
Chesapeake Bay. The Roanoke and James Rivers drain directly
eastward. The New River flows northwest to join the Ohio, and the
Tennessee flows southwest to join the Mississippi. These basins,
in order from steepest to most shallow gradient, are tabulated below:

One's first impression would be that the New River Valley
would have the largeut' caves, as its shallow gradient would not
erede as rapidly. As can be seen from the map, the New River and
Tennessee Valleys do have well over half of the major caves. Tirose
in the James River Valley tend to cluster at its headwaters in Bath
County or Roanoke County. The Roanoke Valley, on the other hand,
has only one major cave. We must realize, of course, that the
Roanoke Valley covers only a small fraction of the total area, and
most of it is in 'shale; however, even in the Trey areas, the caves
62'o nothing spectacular.
