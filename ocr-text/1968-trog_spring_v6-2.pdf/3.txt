EDITOR'S COLUMN
Ever since I started caving, I've been a little pessimistic
about girl cavers. This is probably due to the fact that I began
caring with several other fellows from my high school, and we just
never took any girls caving. The first time I saw a girl caver,
my mind was boggied, I'd never heard of such a thing. After I
got to VPI, I managed to accept the fact that some girls do go caving,
but most of these were occasional-trip people from the Radford
College Geography Club who had no business in a cave. Taking these
girls to 'Tawney's or Link's was OK if nothing else was going on,
bus to consider taking a girt on a survey trip, or a long exploring
trip, forget it!
Then, lace in 1965 and early 166, Anne Braithwaite started
hanging around and going caying. She was the first real girl caver
I'd known. Anne could work a Brunton, didn't mind water, and, up
to a point, enjoyed long trips, After Annie became Mrs, R, E.
Whittemore, it was obvious that we had our first real female caver
since Bonnie Marland, For about a year, Annie was the only 32:1
caver in the club, for at that time, out of 6000 students at WI,
2:00) were girls. And those 400 were just too busy to go caratie

diise slucus, several began coming to Cave Club meetings, Well,
sot this exciting. These girls were really putains a monkey
rench in the works. The meetings calmed down a bit, language was
cleaned up, if only temporarily, and some hard-core cavers were

I returned to Virginia and the Cave Club in November, there was a

and a larger number of girls on cave trips. In fact, sometimes they
bard together and take ALL-GIRL trips.
so it looked as though in place of all the "petty-politics of the
past, we were now cluttered up with petty-coats".* But through all
This, I still maintained that goof-off trips with girls were fine,
but I'd never take them on a mapping trip, or a long, rough trip.
I returned to school in January of this year, and was conned
the first weekend (in a blizzard at that) into going to Clover Hollow
(which I consider a strenous cave) with some girls, And I discovered
that girls can be girls and good cayers too! Since then I've had
the opportunity to cave with most of the girls in the club, and
objectively speaking, they're all pretty good, I found that they
don'Ä‹ start crying when they get into deep water, in fact, they stand
in it and splash each other, and they don't freeze up on some
