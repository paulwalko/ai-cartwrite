THE TECH TROGLODYTE - SPRING 1968
LONGHAIR CAVING
Saturday, February 17, 1968, shall go down in the Cave Club
annals as an historic occasion. On that cold, windy day five members
of the fairer sex (four Cave Club members and one humble trainee)
went caving. Without the aid of male strength, leadership, and
reassurance, Arabia Benitez, Eileen Aldridge, Tina Noble, Anne Whittemore,
and myself, braved Starne's Cave.
After traveling two hours on Terry Pick's instructions(?) we
finally made it to the cave where Arabia, an experienced seventeen
hour old rember of the club, rigged the huge fifteen foot dangerous
drop with a Swiss seat about seven feet long. We went down into the
entrance where we prepared our lamps for the journey. I had borrowed
Tor Vigour's hardhat (which was terribly filthy) and he, like the
gentleman he is, put chunks of black gravel into the larp saying that
it was carbide. Needless to say, my light would not work so we dumped
more carbide into it ontop of the black gravel. I finally realized
that something was wrong when I had to recarbide a little while
later.
We left for the twenty foot ladder drop and had no trouble getting
down evroept that Anne's overalls suffered a little wear and tear
(mostly tear). Our first stop was Lane Stadium to cool our preciaus
cargo of wine (kosher of kourse) then we went to look at the formations
where Anne played a mean stalactite, took pictures, and looked at
the sixty foot waterfall drop.
After walking a while more we went back to Lane and opened our
wine which was merrily passed around to the corruption of Eileen and
Tina. After about a half hour of drinking and being merry we headed
back for the entrance.
We detoured a couple of times where Arabia suckered me into
checking about a 200 foot crawl. I went because Anne and Arabia told
me how good it would be if they could say that I had checked out a
possible lead to the upper passage, when I came up for membership.
With thoughts of glory I went in about a hundred feet where my lamp
went out (it seems to do so every time I get into a tight place).
However, keeping my cool which I received in the bad air passage of
Warm River when Vig's and ray lights went out, I backed out and recarbided.
I then went all the way in with my rind imagining all these beautiful
thoughts of having a passage nared after me etc.; only to find out that
it was a dead end (I still don't think it is).
We headed back again and checked another false lead and finally
went up the ladder for a total of 12 5 WOMAN hours. Once out of the cave
we met the owner who was surprised to find an all girl caving trip. He
wants to know if anyone is interested in buying the cave and about
thirty acres of land around it.
