THE GREAT
ROPPEL DEBACLE
Starring: Win Wright, Carol Trexler, Ben Keller,
Philip Balister, and Bill Koerschner
With Special Guest Star: Tom Miller
We arrived late Sunday night at the new, improved
version of the Central Kentucky Karst Coalition fieldhouse.
We were met by Tom Miller, who was spending the week there.
His quiet, unassuming manner I suspected was a reflection
of the supreme self-confidence of a supercaver rather than
shyness. We discussed the various options for the upcoming
trip; should we follow the standard Main Entrance route,
which includes an upper 35 ft ladder drop, a lower 70 ft
rope drop and Å¹ mile of popcorny canyon, or go for the newly-
opened and largely horizontal Weller Entrance. The new
route promised to cut off 3 hours of travel time, but was
flawed by a mysterious feature known as the Dread Drain Pool.
Philip voted an emphatic, "NAY", but we stubbornly opted for
the unknown.
After a restless night spent amid slapping plastic,
whining puppies, scurrying rats and our own snoring (or
rather Philip's), we awoke bleary-eyed to the sound of
sleet lashing the side of the fieldhouse. An inch of free-
zing rain already covered the trees, cars, roads and Win's
down parka, which had been near a rather porous window.
Tom grinned as he cooked his own breakfast over the field-
house stove - we eyed his baeon and eggs hungrily. Well
damn it! We just had to go to town .... just had to eat;:
because if you didn't eat, you didn't shit. And if you
didn't shit, your worst fears would be realized some 18 hrs
later while still in the cave. We skidded the vehicles
off Eudora Ridge and into town. Ben had to ride in the
back of Philip's truck to keep it between the ditches. We
ate heartily and steeled ourselves to the task of getting
back up the icy ridge. One vehicle made it - Philip's
truck; the other had to be pushed laboriously up the hill
in the icy drizzle. Back at the fieldhouse we discovered
the secret to Philip's sucess - a giant log (actually half
a tree) filled the back of his truck. Philip dubbed the
log "Surrogate. Ben" and claimed the resemblance was striking.
As we walked in the door, Tom was just suiting up - he
had on an unusual wetsuit with a quilted, rip-proof surface.
He said he bought it in France .... a lot of Europeans used
them. I wondered what fantastic European caves he had been
in. We asked him to join us, but he declined, saying that
he was only going in for a short recon trip. MY GOD! A SOLO
CAVER! Enough to make VPI's rescue gear rattle in the box!
An hour later we followed his snowy tracks to the Weller
Entrance. It had begun to rain heavily, but the entrance
passage was bone dry - Heaven by Virginia standards. We
bellycrawled through an impressive 100 foot long dig,
