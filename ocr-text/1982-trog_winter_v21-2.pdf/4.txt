FROM THE PODIUM...
(The Werewolf Growls)
WWW.
When Kenny asked me to write a column
for the Trog, my first inclination was to
dash off a brief and rather pointless piece,
bewailing the cruelty of newsletter editors
hounding innocent club officers for material.
It later occured to me that there is a topic
which needs airing, and that the president's
column is the perfect place to wave it about.
The subject is the discrepancy which occurs
from time to time between the official policy
of the club, and the real actions of some of
its members.
Two specific problems have to do with the
use (or misuse) of the club sign-out sheet,
and the practice of belaying (or not!) ladder
climbs. The issue of the sign-out sheet has been argued, at some length,
on many occasions. Nevertheless, some people still don't bother to sign
their trip in immediately upon return to town, but may instead wait un-
til they have eaten, gone to a party, and run past their estimated time
of arrival. If this "wolf-crying" continues, some may be hard-pressed to
be convinced to prepare for a rescue, because they will be sure that the
missing parties are really just off somewhere having a good time. Need-
less to say, such abuse of the sign-out sheet should be cause for the
club to take some sort of punitive action, such as censure.
The matter of belaying ladder climbs has not received as much atten-
tion of late, but seems as always to be with us. The club voices the idea
that any climb, however insignificant, should be belayed. Ladders being
the occasionally treacherous creatures they are, and humans being humanly
capable of blunder, this ideal makes good sense -- although there may be
exceptional exceptions. At times, someone stating this policy may ring
somewhat false -- the words jibe, but the un»ôtated message is "Those of
us who are real men don't do this on belay, but if you insist..." Safe
practice stifled by the foetid air of machismo! This attitude of he-man
caving practice is self-perpetuating and strictly counter-productive. Let's
all try to consider carefully before proceeding without belay.
A final point which rarely receives as much as a nod is the announce-
ment of certain types of trips at club meetings. Announcements made at the
meetings go into the minutes, and become the responsibility of the club.
The club should not be put in a position making it legally responsible
for the actions of individuals in the club. What these people do on their
own, of course, is not the club's business (unless blatantly against club
policy, as in entering closed caves). If some activity requires discretion,
please be discrete enough not to involve the organization.
On a less serious note, it is good to notice that the club continues
to grow. Good progress is being made in mapping several caves, and the
number of people involved in such projects appears to be on the upswing.
In general, it looks as if 1982 will be a good year.
Long-windedly,
Richard (Boo) Croft
