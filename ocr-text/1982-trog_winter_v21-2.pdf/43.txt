Pissed Off
During the American Civil War the Confederates to provide nitrate
for making gunpowder had to resort to all sorts of devices, such as dig-
ging out and leaching the earth from old smokehouses, barns, and caves
and making artificial beds of all sorts of nitrogenous matter, having
agents for the purpose in every town and city.
The officer at Selma, Alabama was particularly energetic and enthu-
siastic in his work and put the following advertisement in the Selma
newspaper on October 1, 1863:
"The ladies of Selma are respectfully requested to preserve the
chamber lye collected about the premises for the purpose of making nitre.
A barrel will be sent around daily to collect it. John Haralson, Agent,
Nitre and Mining Bureau, C.S.A."
This attracted the attention of army poets and the first of the fol-
lowing two effusions resulted. It was copied and privately circulated
over the Confederacy. Finally it crossed the line, and an unknown Federal
poet added the "Yankee's View of It."
CONFEDERATE VIEW OF IT
John Haralson, John Haralson-- you are a wretched creature;
You've added to this bloody war a new and useful feature.
You'd have us think, while every man is bound to be a fighter
The Ladies, bless the pretty dears, should save their pee for nitre.
John Haralson, John Haralson, where did you get the notion
To send the barrel 'round to gather up the lotion?
We thought the girls had work enough in making shirts and kissing,
But you have put the pretty dears to Patriotic Pissing.
John Haralson, John Haralson, pray do invent a neater
And somewhat less immodest way of making your saltpetre--
For 'tis an awful idea, John, gunpowdery and cranky
That when a lady lifts her skirts, she's killing off a Yankee.
YANKEE VIEW OF IT
John Haralson, John Haralson, we've read in song and story
How women's tears, through all the years, have moistened fields of glory-
But never was it told before, how 'mid such scenes of slaughter
Your Southern beauties dried their tears and went to making water.
No wonder that your boys were brave; who couldn't be a fighter
If every time he fired his gun, he used his sweetheart's nitre?
And vice versa, what could make a Yankee soldier sadder
Than dodging bullets fired by a pretty woman's bladder?
They say there was a subtle smell which lingered in the powder
And as the smoke grew thicker and the din of battle louder
That there was found in this compound one serious objection--
. No soldier boy could sniff it without having an erection!!!
