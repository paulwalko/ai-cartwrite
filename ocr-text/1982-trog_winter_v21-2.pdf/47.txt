traverse. Then it was time to move on to make room.
Finally we reached a large trunk passage which sloped
down steeply on the right. About half of the group was
moving noticeably slower so Pete and I decided to split up.
He took the faster group on down the trunk passage to a
large room called Dupont Circle. He knew of a good high
lead he wanted to check out. I took the rest down the
bank on the right through some holes and sleazy mud in the
direction of the loop out of the cave.
We soon came to another permantly rigged rope. This
one wasn't going to be as easy as the other one. Mud was
everywhere and the rope, once you chimmneyed up to where
it was rigged, went over a slight overhang and down ten
feet. This was a real nuisance drop as you couldn't safely
arm rappel it with the angle at the lip. If you fell it
would be down a deep drainage ditch. So, everyone had to
put on rappel gear for a piddly little eight foot drop.
Where you touched down was a spot called "Goes-into-Lake".
Once again disappointment hit me because the lake level
was a foot lower than before. That drought sure did spoil
a good time!
The technique for crossing "Goes-into-Lake" (seven feet
wide, water twenty feet deep), was to put both feet on
one wall, both hands on the other wall (nose six inches
above the water) and start "walking" your way down the
passage. Bear in mind that hands, feet, and walls were
gloopy mud. The beginning was the easy part. Once you had
gone fifteen feet the passage bent to the right and you
had to struggle upwards to get five feet over the water
as the walls widened to eight feet. Another ten feet farther
a dilemma presented itself. You were straining to stretch
eight feet, your arms and legs were trembling badly, your
breath was coming fast and rapid, sweat rolled off your
face and fogged up your glasses, you were four of five feet
above twenty foot deep water, your lamp was almost out,
and now some jerk told you that you had to transfer over
to the wall your feet were on, all without falling into
the water! ESADMF! The technique, of course, was to throw
yourself blindly backwards and hope you landed with a
squish of mud instead of a splash of water. Most people
did okay.
But the fun was not over! With trembling limbs and
fogged up glasses a vertical fifteen foot flowstone climb
had yet to be surmounted. The water flowing down it.
didn't help and the ragged faces of the group were con-
vincing enough to rig a handline. About this time Pete's
group came within earshot so much yelling ensued. Their
high lead was impossible to get into. Any splash from them
