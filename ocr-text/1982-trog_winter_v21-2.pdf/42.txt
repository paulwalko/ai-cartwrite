The Loop
Last summer when I was sewing together my cam rig a friend of mine
pointed out that the shoulder cam should have a backup. "A backup?" I said.
I was consciously over-building my shoulder cam. "Sure," he says, "You
don't want to end up hanging upside down in a waterfall, do you?"
Well hell no, I don't," I thought. So after some more thinking I came up
with what I think is a good backup.
Now this is not a new idea as I found out later, but it is a good one.
What the backup consists of is another piece of webbing sewn into the
floating knee cam with a loop in the other end. This loop clips into the
seat harness. After completing this loop I took the rig out and tested it.
est involved Unhooking the shoulder cam and falling backwards. Aaaagg!!!
Lo and behold I ended up face to face with my floating knee cam. The loop
had prevented me from going completely upside down. This could come in
handy in a strong waterfall someday.
The loop is not hard to make as compared to the rest of the rig, and
I think it should be included to assure maximum safety. By the way, another
advantage I found with this loop is that when I pull the shock cord off my
shoulder, the cam doesn't fall to the ground, it just sort of hangs there
suspended. With this loop you don't have to worry about tripping over the
knee cam. So make one, dammit!
