Once again this year, the town of Radford was invaded by drunken
cavers, loud music, and the pungent smell of puke. Yes, Banquet has al-
ready come and gone. The dinner was held at the Wesley Foundation in
Radford. After pigging-out, we were treated with an interesting slide
show by Bill Jones who explained the Cannonball and Jackass Theories of
Cave Formation.
The Awards Committee did an outstanding job this year, first of all
by awarding Jerry Redder the A.. I. Cartwright Award without his knowing
it (he was on the Awards Committee). Some of the more notable award win-
ners were Doug Yeatts for Flameout (a bottle of Thunderbird), Ruth Mont-
gomery for Safe Driver (a car steering wheel), Boo Croft for the P.W.
award (a ball and chain); Trainee-of-the-Year was Hillary Minich. Oldest
and youngest active cavers were Daddy Don Anderson (a bottle of old Gran-
dad) and Ben Keller (a baby bottle full of beer). Daddy Don wasn't there
for his award, but the bottle of Grandad was taken care of during the par-
ty. Joe Zokaites, received the Brain Bucket; John Lohner received a What-
Knot; Buddy Penley received a Mammoth Cave tobacco twist; Hugh Beard, Ed
and Nancy Richardson received adoption papers; Ken Bonenberger received .
a voided diploma. Guano Clusters were given to Knox Ward for his free
fall into Picnic last spring, Lawrence Britt and Dave Cinsavich for parties,
Ed Devine for his scaling poles, and Lee Little for the Clover Hollow
Rescue.
