The
Cuning
Picture this situation: You are in the
middle of a party for which you have trained
for weeks and months. You are attempting
to push, the unknown limits of alcohol
tolerance in the human body. You raise
your glass mug to your mouth for another
75 ml injection of the liquid catalyst.
Then the accident occurs. The liquid, which
is cooled to 3 to 5°C, has caused condensate
to form on the glass when it was exposed to
proper party temperatures (22-26°c). The
glass mug slips from your grasp, resulting,
in waste of beer, mug, not to mention
weeks of preparation (See Figure 1). How
could you have avoided this accident?
. In the Spring 1977 DTC Column, former
chairman Dave Ponison expounded upon the con-
struction and advantages of the drinking cup
belay. This system utilized a piece of avalanche
Figure 1: :
cord, a plastic cup, and a bowline knot (not to
No belay
be confused with a what-knot). When the cup was
attached to the subject's finger by means of the cord and bowline knot,
spillage was reduced substantially. However, this technique could only
be applied to plastic cups. Also, it was found that the amount of spill-
age was directly proportional to the amount of hand movement used by the
subject in the course of talking or when searching for that elusive
piece of pie.
Further tests, however, have resulted in advances in the Cup Belay
Technique. The cornerstone of the latest advances has been the moving of
the rig point from the finger to the neck. The neck, it has been found
through constant observation and strenuous testing, is
a more stable rigging point than the finger. Thus,
barring complete structural failure of the subject,
using the neck substantially reduces spillage due to
body movement.
One advantage of the Cup Belay is that in its
more basic forms, it is easily and cheaply .constructed.
Of course, there are also more expensive versions.
We will attempt to cover the entire spectrum of Cup
Belay Techniques.
If you are a student drinker and find it difficult
to get financial support, or you are not sure you want
to invest that much in drinking, the Simple Static
Cup Belay (SSCB) is still within your means.
