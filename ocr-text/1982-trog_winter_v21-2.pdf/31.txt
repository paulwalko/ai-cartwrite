Newberry's Conservation Trip
While hoisting a few beers at Mr. Fooz last spring, the subject of
conservation trips came up. High on the list was a trip to Newberry-Banes
since the cave contains several carbide dumps which have not been emptied
for several years. The trip would be difficult, however, because the
dumps were at the bottom of three drops. A large number of people would
be needed to rig and carry the spent carbide out. It seemed formidable
at the time. Visions of 100 to 200 lbs. of carbide being carried out
of the cave haunted me at night. This would be one trip with a lot of
trainee "sherpas".
After many months of idleness and sport caving, the trip was finally
scheduled for early January of 82. Unfortunately, Mother Nature is a
bitch, and she proved it with record cold waves and torrential rainfalls.
that cancelled the trip on two occassions. Eventually, Jan. 30 was deemed
suitable and a desperate plea was put out for volunteers, that culminated
in recruiting 9 others for the trip.
On a relatively warm day, John Lohner, Jerry Redder, Binny Ballou,
Rich Neiser," Jin Washington, Bill Ekhaml, Paul Norris, Nick Machara,
Johnny Johnsson, and myself set out to do the impossible. After meeting
Redder on the road, we drove to the landowners house, good ol' Buddy
Penley, and left a note since he wasn't home. We proceeded to drive
to the entrance and busied ourselves with checking ropes and gear. We
finally couldn't think of anything else to keep us out of the cave and
we sallied forth. Most people free climbed to the Balcony, halfway down
the 60' entrance drop, but to save time and for safety we rigged Rich's
rope aswell. After that we converged onto the Nuisance drop, rigged a
ladder, and went to the top of Bill's Rappel.
Jerry had all ready rigged the 160' drop with Binny's rope and asked
if anyone had mechanicals in case the rope didn't reach the bottom.
Rich and I were the only ones who did, but Rich was busy belaying the
ladder so. I was volunteered. I thought Jerry was kidding since the rope
length was sufficent for the drop and it didn't look like he had used a lot
in rigging. Jerry thought it was best, though, and since you don't argue with
experience I didn't. After being' assured there was a knot in the end
of the rope and then a fast rappel, I vowed never to doubt Jerry again.
There was about 2' of rope left on the ground: Everybody rappeled the
drop in good form. . The drop and rockface is so pretty and people rappelling
down only enhanced the view. from the bottom. John and Jerry stayed uptop
to rig a hauling system for the carbide. Now the real work began.
. At the bottom of Bill's were two metal drums filled with spent carbide.
One had almost completely disintegrated. Also, there was a lot of spent
carbide that would have to be picked up by hand. Binny, Bill, and myself
left for the Vault Room. Jim and Nick cleaned side passages while the
rest stayed to clean the bottom of Bill's. The job was complicated,
somewhat, by the many hibernating bats in and around the Vault Room.
Communication was kept to a minimum and then only by whispering since
the shock of waking a hibernating bat is enough to kill it. Binny led
us to the Vault Room and we entered with muted footfalls and baited breath.
