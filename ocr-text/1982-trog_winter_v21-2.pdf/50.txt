By this time everyone was through the chimmney except three.
They also complained but turned around. Pete and I start-
ed pushing any leads around to bypass the collapse but
found none. Since he had helped to map the cave, he knew
that we would have to completely retrace our steps.
On our last trip no one had realized it was anything
other than solid floor because we had had eight people
standing under the climb. So, the collapse must have
been caused by mine blasting since it didn't disintegrate
under us then.
I wearily looked at the hole that was only fifteen
minutes from the entrance and turned back toward the chimmney.
We got back to the bottom of the drop after we had been
in the cave five and a half hours. Everyone went through
their gear and we came up with three complete knot rigs.
Pete went up first and Lee and I started putting people
on rope assembly line fashion.
With five people up, I tied on a four wrap helical and
got ten feet off the floor when the knots and I slid back
down to the floor.
"Wow, that was fun! But it's not going to work".
As I untied, Lee quickly put the next guy on with
prussiks above me and sent him up. The problem was mud.
The rope had been rigged in the cave for one and a half
years and was a solid cake of the stuff. Solidly caked)
feet and gloves didn't help the knots either.
I tied on the set we had at the bottom with four wrap
prussiks. Five feet off the floor and I was back down again.
"Petel", Lee yelled, "The knots are slipping, you are
going to have to haul us up!"
"Okay, sit tight" was the muffled reply.
Four of us remained. Lee, Ed, Paul, and myself.
The way the rope was now I believed that even a new
set of knots would slip. The option remained, of course,
that someone above could pull the rope up and take it to
"Goes-into-Lake" to wash it. The problem was the cold.
Everyone was exhausted and shivering and the last thing
anyone wanted to do was put their hands in cold cave water.
Anyhow, it seemed Pete would rather haul us up and I'll
take a free ride anytime.
Paul started shivering uncontrollably so I broke out
the space blanket and he and Ed huddled under it.
Even through the exhaustion and cold, the high good
humor of the trip never faded. Bawdy songs and sick jokes
rose from the depths and no one was really concerned about
our situation. We were in the best of hands-ours!
Soon the rope came slithering down.
"Ready to haull"
