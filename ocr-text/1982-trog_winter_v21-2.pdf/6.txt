Its malignancy is firmly spread throughout the caving world now,
ready at any moment to reach out, grasp, and consume any tidbit of
incriminating information, striking fear into the hearts of even the
most courageous of men. You may run, hide, to try to reason with it
to no avail. J. B. Cooper escaped from a Boeing 727 with a load of
cash, Papillon escaped from Devil's Island, Houdini escaped countless
times from straitjackets, Jerry Talwell has escaped from reality,
but there's no escaping the. ..
GROT TO GRAPEVINE
Cupid has fired a salvo of arrows at the club this year and has
been hitting the mark quite regularly it seems. (See following ar-
ticle on the '82 Banquet.) of the most notable of the results are
Paul and Roberta's wedding last December and Bill and Marilyn Douty's
wedding on Banquet weekend. Chuck and Pat Shorten had a graduation/
condolence party for their roomate the Friday after finals. Paul
and Roberta Kirchman got married the next day with the reception at
Jozo's place. (We were all warned not to be shocked by Paul's par-
ents behavior.) A carload of cavers left the Banquet party at 4 in
the morning to surprise Douty at his wedding in Georgia. Word has
it that Douty was even wearing a hand-tied. necktie.
The weekend before fall quarter finals had some excitement when
Lee Little did an air rappel in Clover Hollow and had to be carted
out in a Stokes litter. He says he's still looking for some more of
those muscle relaxants.
Elsewhere in the club, Dave Shantz is still in Alaska while
Mike and Suzanne Frame bicycle through New Zealand. Sharon Brink-
man ran off to Morgantown and married Ed Loud. Carol Trexler, Sue
Heazel, John Mummery, and Philip (Foul-up) Balister left this quar-
ter to go Co-oping. Hugh Rufus Beard is back in town and anounced
that foresters don't have a hard time finding a job he's had five
of them in the past year. Stymie Conner is back from Co-oping. He
spent two weeks in Mexico over the Christmas Holiday with some Ga.
Tech cavers. They bounced several pits including Golondrinas. Bill
Shipman moved into a new apartment and still has trouble figuring
out where it is.
Kent Thompson and Mike (Gaydog) Gaydosh held their second quar-
• terly "Furniture Smashin' and Tree Prunin' Party" where everyone
showed up in barefeet and cut-offs in -50° weather. Keith Smith
went animal, cans and coasters became ammunition, and Dave Cinsavich's
car froze. That next Monday morning Kent's truck ran out of gas at
8 in the morning on his way back from campus, and he had to make a
phone call for a car, a gas can, and money.
Keith Smith's liquid checkers game has been a big hit at his
apartment. Jim Jones slid off the road on his BMW motorcycle, leav-
ing it scarred but operable. Dave Cinsavich and Lawrence Britt, in
addition to having Jeep parts strewn throughout their apartment now
have a stray sleeping on their couch. Ken Bonenberger has been throw-
ing Friday night parties in his bedroom this quarter. Three Willys
