by the strike but are mostly joint controlled in nature. However,
it appears as though the existence of large amounts of water cre- .
ated some large borehole type phreatic trunk passage that generally
follows the strike. The Main Subway in Newberry-Banes and.whisper
Hall in Paul Penley's exhibit this kind of trunk which may have
been a continous 'river running the length of the hollow at one time.
The tendency of the streams in the caves to f'low towards the
center of the system was noted. The controlling link was not dis-
covered until a dig in Newberry-Banes located a stream that was
estimated to be equivalent to the combined flows of the known
tributaries. The dimensions of the stream in "The Tubes" were
measured at a particular section to be six feet wide by four inches
deep. The stream was calculated by Manning's open channel equation
to be flowing approximately 1.2 ft3/sec.
The major spring of interest is the Burnt House Spring, which
has the most flow of all the springs and is located due north from
the disappearance of the Tubes stream. The Big Sink is directly
in line with the stream disappearance and the spring but any rela-
tionship of the stream to the formation of the enormous collapse
sink is uncertain. ,
From east to west, the springs potentially related to the
drainage of the cave system are: Wagner Spring, Otter Spring,
Ethel Bane's Spring, Burnt House Spring, Indian Patch Spring,
and Brown's Spring (shown on Figure 2). Oak Root Spring and
Moorehead Spring resurge to the northwest of Coon Cave but are
not shown on the map.
Due to the size and location of the Burnt House Spring, direct
correlation to the drainage of the cave system was assumed. However,
the possible existence of an interconnecting fracture pattern and
the role of the other springs remained a question. Hence, the
purpose of the dye trace was to: 1) confirm the connection of
