GEOHYDROLOGY OF THE
SKYDUSKY HOLLOW CAVE SYSTEM
Bland County, Virginia
The area of the tracing study is located in Bland County,
Virginia on the northwest flank of Big Walker Mountain adjacent
to Route 608. The mildy rolling topography, an exceptional example
of Appalachian karst, was named Skydusky Hollow by one of the local
cattle ranchers, J. S. Penley. There are numerous sinkholes that
dot the valley, one of which, called the Big Mother Sink, has been
surveyed as having eleven acres of surface area. This, along with
the absence of surface streams, indicates a definite existence of
karst groundwater flow.
. The major cave forming carbonate rocks in the hollow consist
of the Middle-Ordovician Witten and Wassum limestones. The Witten
varies in thickness up to 350 feet in the area and grades upward
into the Moccasin siltstone approximately two-thirds of the distance
up the northwest base of Big Walker Mountain. All of the drainage
from the mountain along the hollow sinks at the Witten-Moccasin
contact which has formed caves of great vertical relief. The sur-
vey of the caves by the explorers from the VPI Cave Club has tabu-
lated more than 20 miles of passage and the plots of the cave maps.
indicate similar fracture patterns in the passage development.
These patterns may have contributed to the drainage of the basin
and the physical connections of several of the cave entrances.
The average 250 southeast dip of the bedrock has had no great
effect on the flow path of the sinking water where instead it finds
advantage in the fractures in the limestone and drains down grade
towards Walker Creek. As the water follows the piezometric surface,
it leaves the more easily eroded Witten and Wassum for the more
resistant, chert impregnated Chatham Hill Formation. (Figure 1)
The strike is N650E and most of the passages are not controlled
