and six others the pits had been full of water, some
twenty feet deep. Now they were bone dry. .
More clambering over breakdown and straddling holes
and we reached a passage several hundred feet long
and an almost perfect subway tunnel. I expected
to hear a train whistle any minute and do a Wiley
E. Coyote train ride. What was disappointing was that
the water was only ankle deep where there was any at
all. Before, it had been thigh deep. Because of the
low water I resigned myself to a boring trip. If I
had only known!
The first obstacle to show itself was a steep climb
up a mud bank. To save time and a possible fifty
foot slide to the bottom, a piece of Goldline had
been permanently rigged above several years ago.
Once everyone had made a clown out of themselves on
the ascent, we continued on.
This entire trip was through mud caked rooms and
climbs, most blackened by the mine ventilation.
The next passage was no exception but there were
some nice columns on the right wall. The ceiling got
lower and, once on hands and knees, we crawled through
two large columns to a plateau overlooking a room.
Here a rope was rigged and people started the twenty
foot rappel.
Once down I slid the rest of the way to the bottom.
A steep climb up the opposite wall and I popped up
through a small hole to another plateau in the same
room. It was at the same level as the first one but
forty feet away. We threw mudballs at the stragglers
awhile and then moved on.
Now things really got interesting! Some more crawl-
ing through soda straws and columns and another pit
was reached. It was thirty feet in diameter and fun-
nelled downwards to its forty foot depth. I put my
seat on and clipped in to the permantly rigged tyrolean
belay rope. Once securely in, I climbed downwards
five feet and started traversing across the left wall.
When Pete had rigged the rope, he pounded two 2
foot steel rods into the walls with a carabiner on
each. This redirected the rope so you couldn't trip
on it. At each carabiner you had to stabilize your-
self and unclip the one connecting the rope to the rod.
After you passed the seat carabiner by the rod the
other one would be reclipped to the rod. At no time
was your seat carabiner unclipped from the rope so
you were constantly on belay. Once on the other side
you got to watch everyone else get unnerved by the
