the Tubes stream in Newberry's to Burnt House Spring; 2) verify
the connection of the tributary cave streams to the Tubes; and
3) identify the relationships of the other springs to the drainage
of the basin by subsequently defining the area of runoff contri-
bution to the cave system.
The first tracing attempt was to place a charge of dye in the
Tubes and trap all of the springs. This trace confirmed the con-
nection of the Newberry's stream to Burnt House and did not show
a positive indication for any of the other springs. The possi-.
bility of a tie to the other springs was not ruled out due to the
exceedingly dry conditions that persisted during the first few
traces. Due to the nature of the transmissibility or flow regime
of the aquifer, higher volumes of flow would raise the water table
which might cause the water to search for alternative flow paths.
The Burnt House Spring was measured by the Manning's equation
on the same day as the previously stated Tubes measurement and it
was found to be flowing about 2.2 cfs. At best, the use of this .
equation is an estimation but the occurence of a larger flow at :
the spring indicates an addition to the system at some point.
Whether this contribution consisted of kargt flow from one of the
caves or from seepage through the soil was to be determined through
dye tracing.
A current meter was taken to some of the springs to measure
the actual flows during the dry summer of 1980. The Ethel Bane's
Spring calculated 0.06 cf's; Burnt House, 1.35 cfs; Indian Patch,
0.10 cfs; and Brown Spring, 0.16 cfs. These values were from a
very dry year and the normal or flood flows should be much greater.
For example, the Burnt House Spring has been witnessed to be flowing.
an estimated 12+ cfs at a time of heavy rain and snow melt.
The next objective of connecting the different cave streams .
to the system required the placement of traps at all of the springs
