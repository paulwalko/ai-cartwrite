powder(Sulpho Rhodamine B2) and Flourescein Yellow powder.
All traps were tested on a Turner 111 Model Flourometer using : ..
the combination 546/590 filters for the pink dye and the combination
2A and 47-B/2A and 12 filters for the detection of the flourescein.
Instrumental to the accomplishment of the dye trace were the
cave surveying activities of W. F. Koerschner, E. A. Devine, W. C.
Stephens, and the Skydusky Hollow Cave Survey. 'Procurement of
the dye and charcoal was made possible through the help of J. H.
Fagan.
Much work still remains to determine the performing char-
acteristics of the karst drainage basin such as the time of travel
of the dye. Determining the shape of the flood hydrograph can
reveal much information as to the conditions that exist in the
subsurface flow regime.
