Since so many couples bit the dust, went off the deep end, or were
dropping like flies this year, zipper awards were given. First for those
engaged, "Dropping Like Flies" zippers were given to Boo and Boo-etta,
Jozo and Carolzo, Rich and Binnie, Ken and Brenda, Bob and Chris, and
Dave Bell and Jean Nye. "Dropped Like Flies" were given to Paul and Berta
Kirchman, Richard and Pat Cobb, Bill and Pam Stephens, Sharon and Ed Loud,
Pam and Lor Windle. "Soon to be Dropped" was given to Glen and Nancy.
The party was at the Radford VFW hall where Doug Perkins took care
of the music and for the first time in years Stringfellow didn't bartend.
For those who were still coherent enough to see, a film of the New River
Gorge Bridge was shown upstairs and was followed by slides of Bridge Day
and hang gliding. At this point, yours truly blacked out and could not
remember what happened the rest of the evening.
Much thanks goes to Boo Croft for doing a good job organizing Banquet
this year. Appreciation also goes to those few die-hards who survived the
evening and cleaned up the next morning.
