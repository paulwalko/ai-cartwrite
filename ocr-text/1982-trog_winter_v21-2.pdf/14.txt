Zinc leaching is also evident on the inside wall of the lamp, at the
initial crack site (see Figure 3). The residue of dezincification is a
porous,,brittle copper matrix that could easily initiate stress corrosion
cracks. Zinc leaching of alpha brass is common in basic, unaerated,
elevated temperature atmospheres, like the one found inside a carbide lamp.
The second type of corrosion encountered was the oxidation of copper
and zinc inside cracks to form an oxide film of uniform chemical com-
position over the entire fracture surface. EDXA spot scans were taken at
many different points on the fracture surface: Near the inside edge of
the lamp, near the outside edge, near cracks and on crack faces. Each scan
yielded the same surface composition (See Figure 10). Zinc leaching did
not occur inside the cracks because there was no outward flow of material
from there to the surface where it could be carried away.
Corrosion was particularly heavy in the failed region because:
1) The residual stresses there made the metal more susceptible to attack
and 2) The geometry of the lamp created a difficult-to-clean crevice at
the fracture site. Because the spent carbide can never be fully cleaned out
from there the crevice is under constant chemical attack from the first
time the lamp is used. However, corrosion will be heaviest when the lamp
is being used because the temperature is high, and there is plenty of
moisture to transport fresh calcium hydroxide to the growing cracks.
The alpha brass carbide lamp bottom failed by stress corrosion cracking.
In the first stages of failure dezincification of the lamp interior occured.
The pores in the brittle copper residue in the cold worked crevice metal
were the precursors of the corrosion cracks which would follow. In the
second stage of failure the pits in the copper deepened and entered the brass.
Once in the brass the cracks enlarged by 1) Residual fabrication stresses,
2) Corrosion product wedging, and 3) Usage jars. The new exposed surfaces
were then attacked by corrosives either on the slip planes (transgranular
failure) or along grain boundaries (intergranular cracking). The cracks
grew by this mechanism until failure occured.
