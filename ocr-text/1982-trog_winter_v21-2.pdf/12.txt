STRESS CORROSION CRACKING OF BRASS
IN WARM CALCIUM HYDROXIDE
by Rich Neiser
In the past few years carbide cavers have been confronted
with the serious problem of cracking bases. The following tech-
nical paper describes my findings from an in-depth analysis of
two such bases. The manufacturer, Premier Lamps, is one of the
last two companies making brass lamps. With the advent of high
quality electric lamps the demand for carbide lamps had dropped
significantly in recent years forcing the closing of competitors
shops. Recent bottoms from Premier have shown a susceptibility
to crack after only short usage in the rugged caving environment.
Since the lives and safety of cavers depends on the reliability
of their light sources an analysis of the failed lamps was con-
sidered of paramount importance.
I analyzed the cracked bases with three techniques: 1) Scan-
ning Electron Microscopy (SEM), 2) Metallography or optical micros-
copy, and 3) Energy Dispersive Analysis of X-rays (EDXA), a chem-
ical analysis using X-rays.
Sections of the two failed bottoms were taken for micro-
scopic examination (see Figure 2). Section A-A looked at the
cross section of the failed surface and was used in metallographic
analysis while Section B-B presented a normal view to the fracture
for SEM and EDXA, Sectioning with a slow speed diamond tipped
saw avoided damaging the brass' microstructure near the crack.
During normal operation of the lamp base temperatures ap-
proaching 90 C were measured. While this temperature is not high
enough to affect the brass by itself, the presence of a corrodent,
like calcium hydroxide which is generated by the reaction of
calcium carbide and water, at this temperature will result in an
accelerated chemical attack of the metal. In normal conditions
the presure inside the base due to acetylene gas was found to be
under 20 psi and was considered insignificant in the failure of
the part.
I have included references for those who wish to pursue the
subject further.
