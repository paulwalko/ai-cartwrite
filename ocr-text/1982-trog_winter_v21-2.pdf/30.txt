How to Have Cave Formations in Your
Home Without Vandalizing a Cave
· Have you ever wanted to pick up that one little
speleothem and bring it home just to set on your shelf?
Have you ever wanted to bring home a bunch of formations ?
Have you ever wanted to live in a cave? Well here's your
chance. Now there is a way to put snow white stalactites
and stalagmites in your own home quickly, easily, and le-
gally. Just follow these simple instructions:
1. The next time it snows outside pick a bunch of icicles
off of cars, roofs, your nose, or where ever icicles
grow, and put them in your freezer. Then forget about
them until you get ready to make some fake cave for-
mations.
2. When you feel ambitious, go to the store and get some
parafin wax used for canning. Don't worry, it's not ex-
pensive. Put that up until you're ready to go, too.
3. When you finally quit procrastinating and decide to make
the stupid things you will need the following:
A. a stove
B. a pot large enough to fit the largest icicles
C. the icicles
D. the parafin wax
E. a spoon
4. After you have all the ingredients, put 2 or 3 inches of
water in the pot and boil it. Then put the wax in the
water and let it melt. DANGER: Wax is flammable. Do not
let it get too hot and catch, on fire, because this will
melt the icicles and you will have to wait until it
snows again to get some more.
5. After the wax is melted, drop the icicles in the pot of
wax (one at a time) and fish them out with a spoon. When
the cold öcicle hits the melted wax, the wax will solid-
ify around the icicle. When the wax coated icicle is re-
moved from the pot the wax gets hard.
6. Put the wax coated icicles in the sink and allow the ice
to melt. This may take a couple of hours if you keep your
apartment as cold as mine. When the ice does melt, make
a little hole in the wax and drain the water.
7. Now you are ready to mount your wax formations in your
home, office, car, favorite vandalized cave, or any
place else you see fit. Do this by heating up the remain-
ing wax in the pot, and let it cool until it just begins
to get a skummy layer on top. Then dip the large end of
the formation in the wax and stick it!
