The two metal drums were over-
flowing and we placed these, drums. and
all, into two of three denim bags sup-
plied by Jerry. It was an eerie feel-
ing, working feverishly, in total si-
lence and whispering as low as we
could. We had to move fast, for even
our body heat might wake the bats.
Once we finished, we policed the room
for trash, left a register and then
left. We met Rich on the way out and
he helped carry the bags down the
twisting canyon passage to the bot-
tom of Bill's where they were passed
to others. We felt bad however, since
we inadvertently woke two bats. Well,
we tried.
The carbide at the bottom of
Bill's was collected and placed into
the third denim bag along with the
rotted metal drums in a plastic gar-
bage bag. John and Jerry had lowered
a length of Goldline and rigged a 3.
to 1 "Z" system with a stop cam. Af-
ter some time preparing the bags for
hauling we tied all of them, along ..
with some of our equipment, onto the
rope and Jerry and John 'valiantly
hauled away. Once they were ready
to haul, we decided to leave via the
Devil's Staircase around the pit,
while Rich climbed along side the
load to prevent snagging. Binny knew the way best, and with help
from Jim led us masterfully up to the top of the pit. At the "Coat
Hanger" most of the members were put to shame by the new people.
They did the climb like pros. Binny's attempt at levitation was un-
successful, but she was a pleasure to watch climbing. I was behind
her of course. We eventually reached the top where John, Jerry, and
Rich had finished hauling and derigging...?
After recarbiding and a bite to eat, John and I belayed each
other up the nuisance drop to haul the carbide up. John was nice
and strong so it wasn't much trouble. Jim nearly incinerated every- .'
one at the bottom with a carbide explosion, so it was safer up top..
John and I belayed people and once there was enough people to carry
the bags, John led Paul, Johnny, and Bill up to the balcony, each
carrying a hefty load. (There was another group from UNC doing the
straddle pit and everyone talked with them since they had caved with
Don Anderson before. We forgave them for this transgression and left
them to their fate.) Crossing the straddle pit was interesting since
you could see their lights 70' below. Stepping over that lit void
was a whole new experience. What you can't see, can't hurt you, I
always say.
Fortunatly the 100-200 lbs. of carbide I forecasted turned out
to be only 75 lbs, and they were taken up the entrance drop with no
problems. Everyone climbed up the drop with no problem, some taking
belays while others didn't. The night was warm and the beer tasted
