twenty feet below and became deep water. It was possible
to move with your back on one wall and your knees on the
other or by facing forward and using elbow and knee jams.
The outward force required to stay in the chimmney was such
that only ten or fifteen feet were possible between rests.
Finally, after eighty gruelling feet, I started down and
dropped gratefully to the floor. I knew from memory that
now I had to walk thirty feet forward, climb up on a pile
of dirt, and pull myself up into a hole in the ceiling.
So I walked forward fifteen feet and stopped. I stopped
because there wasn't any more floor. It was gone! A ten
foot by twenty foot section was missing. I could see down
fifty feet to a black zone where the walls narrowed to
five feet. There was no debris visible so the canyon was
considerably deeper. Ten feet up and twenty feet out in
empty air was the hole that was now unreachable.
I didn't say anything until Pete dropped out of the
chimmney and walked to the edge.
"Hey Pete, didn't there used to be a floor there?"
(Pause) "Yep".
He stood there a minute looking down, looked up at the
climb, turned around to us and said "hey fellows, looks
like we have to turn around!"
This was received with unbelieving cries and expletives.
