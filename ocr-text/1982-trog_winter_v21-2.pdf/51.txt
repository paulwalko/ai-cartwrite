We tied Ed in. (Better him than us to test their rig!)
"Hauling!"
Up Ed went. Ten feet, twenty feet.
"Lowering!"
Down Ed came. Five minutes later, "Hauling!" .
Up Ed went. Twenty feet.
"Lowering!"
Down Ed came. This went on a third and fourth time
before "Hauling!"
Ed went up fifteen feet on the first yank, fifteen more
to the ceiling on the second. On the third yank as he en-
tered the tight slot "Ow! #*?/*#"
"Lets haul a little slower fellows" someone yelled.
Finally Ed was up and the rope came slithering back
down. Still not sure their rig was safe, Lee and I tied
Paul in.
The first yank he almost hit the ceiling.
"Hey! Slower!"
The second yank he disappeared up through the slot
amid numerous falling rocks and curses.
I looked at Lee and he looked at me. Who next! I
figured by the time they hauled the third guy up, they
might be so tired they would drop the fourth one so I
jumped in and tied myself in.
I waved goodbye to Lee as I shot to the ceiling in two
yanks. As they prepared for the third yank I pulled my-
self to the widest part of the slot and exhaled. Even so,
a few things got caught, but I made it up.
Now I got to see how they were doing it. The passage
was perfect. Flat, level floor, standing room, and it
went back almost straight for forty feet to the big window.
The rope came up the hole, changed direction through
a pulley Pete held in place, and went straight down the
passage. Each person had a prussik knot attached to the rope !
to pull with. At the start of each haul everyone was in
a line sitting down near the lip. With "Hauling" everyone
stood up and struggled backwards until the last person was
near the window. Then everyone but the first guy sat down
and kept tension. The first guy then walked back to the
beginning, sat down, and resumed tension. The next guy
would repeat the process and so on until the starting
line was complete again. There was no where to rig a stop
knot so this process worked just as well. Three or four
hauls had each person out and soon Lee was up with us.
The rope, once freed, was dragged down the passage
and lowered out the window. By rappelling out the window
and swinging to the other side we could bypass the flowstone
climb, the strenuous straddle of "Goes-into-Lake", and the
