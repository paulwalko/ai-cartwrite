great as we changed, reflecting on a 7.5 hour bust-ass trip. Our
fun wasn't over yet as Jerry's toy ran out of gas near-the Bland
Correctional Center. He was able to use his "West Virginia Credit
Card" and obtain gas from the other two cars and was rescued.
It was a successful trip with carbide being cleaned up, a reg-
ister placed, and newer people being exposed to special rigging tech-
niques, long rappels, and conservation in general. It was decided
to not replace the carbide dumps in the cave since it will help the
ecology and access is limited enough to assume only responsible cavers
visit the cave. Subsequent trips will prove whether this bears fruit
or not. We weren't able to do the Banes drop, and we woke up a few
bats so there were some minuses also. Conservation is alive in the
VPI Grotto and its cavers prove this year after year.
