and in the Tubes. The possibility existed that the subsurface water
could take a course along the hollow that would not bring it in con-
tact with the Tubes. Therefore, the arduous task of placing a dye
trap in the Tubes for each trace was essential to the procedure. ;;
The cave furthest to the east of the system, Spring Hollow,
proved a positive trace to Newberry's and Burnt House Spring in
the summer of 1980. This ruled the ties of Wagner and Otter Springs
to the system. Then, Paul Penley's Cave was traced to Newberry's
and Burnt House in the winter of 1981. In the spring of 1981,
Coon Cave verified positive connection to Newberry's, and Burnt
House. At this point, the Indian Patch Spring and Brown's Spring
were ruled out despite the presence of high background readings.
Finally, the stream that sinks to the west of Coon Cave was traced
to Newberry's and Burnt House in the winter of 1982( the Tubes was
not trapped). This trace ruled out any relationship of Oak Root
and Moorehead Springs to the system. (Figure 2)
So, all of the water that comes off of Big Walker Mountain
within this 2.5 mile stretch of the hollow sinks into the lime-
stone and travels to the center of the cave system where it finds
a weakness in the resistent rock and flows out to Walker Creek
through one discrete channel. A hypotheses was suggested that a
locally structured dip towards the middle at each of the ends may
influence the water to drain in such a fashion. Because the geo-
logy is complex and difficult to define, this may be a valid ex-
planation to the development of the cave system. Also difficult
to define is the contribution of land surface to the basin due
to the complexity of groundwater movement. From the apparent
surface divides of the watershed, the runoff area draining into
Burnt House Spring is about three square miles of land.
The tracing procedure utilized dye traps constructed of
activated charcoal of the 1 to 3 mm grain enclosed in an envelope
of screening material. The tracers used were Pontacyl Pink
.
