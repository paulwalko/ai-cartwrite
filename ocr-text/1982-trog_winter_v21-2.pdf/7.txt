Jeeps in the club are now fully inspected, "totally" legal, and are
sometimes seen in running order all on the same day. Randy Wood got
a chance to four-wheel his Toyota one snowy weekend in February and
ended up pulling everybody (including himself) out of snow drifts.
Chuck and Pat found that their Honda is not the best place to store
15 cartons of Coke in freezing weather.
Moving to the real world we all know and love - caving, we find
Joe Zokaites making progress mapping Newberry - Banes, although Carol
Godla has taken over as sketch. Joe is confined to drawing up data
while his ankle is in a cast. Ed Devine has begun to make a comeback
and has been seen diddling around in Paul's once again. Chuck Shorten
mapped the entire Parker Cave System in one day; Lawrence Britt has
mapped 4000 feet in Starnes and is still going strong; Banes Spring
is still progressing.
Bill Koerschner and several other cavers from the club attempted
to do some mapping in Roppel over Christmas (see WFK's article in.
this issue) but ended up doing a "sport" trip. Bili Stephens, Philip
Balister, Steve Connor, Win Wright, Ben Keller, Carol Trexler, and
company plan to go back there this spring Break.
Last November, Jerry Redder, Pete Sauvigne, Don Anderson, and .
Richard Cobb met Steve Connor and some Ga. Tech cavers and did some
pit bouncing in Alabama. They plan to take a cast of thousands there
again this spring break to do Valhalla, Trenton Well' and a few others.
closer to home, 90 foot rappels were made courtesy of the Bell
System and the Athletic Association. Fifteen JMU cavers descended
on Blacksburg one February weekend to do some caving. Four new mem-
bers were voted into the club this year: Jim Washington, Maureen
Handler, Ben Keller, and Jim Morrisett. Much credit needs to be
given to John Lohner for running the trainee program, organizing the
verticle session, and printing this year's new member issue of the
Trog. Jerry Falwell still has A. I. Cartwright on his mailing list.
Not too many people remember much from the New Years Party held
once again at the Richardson's but the hard-cores made it even through
a snow storm. Mass consumption of alcohol and hors d'oeuvres from Buck-
wheat's silver dish preceded the traditional hayride. Meanwhile in
Blacksburg, Chuck Shorten has been experimenting with silviculture meth-
ods in the Preston National Forest to keep his fireplace going this
winter. Hugh tried to eat a "holesome" tree.
