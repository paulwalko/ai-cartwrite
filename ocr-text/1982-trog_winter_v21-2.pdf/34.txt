JQ's Jerky
1 flank steak, about 1.5 lbs.
1 tsp. each: season salt, Accent, onion powder, Liquid
Smoke and/or BBQ salt.
1/3 tsp. each: garlic powder, Black pepper.
1/4 cup each: Worchestershire sauce, Soy sauce.
Trim off all possible fat, Semi-freeze meat and slice
with the grain into 1/8" slices.
Marinate overnight in the sauce (all of the above
ingredients) in a shallow pan.
Lay strips of meat in single layers on oven racks (be
sure to lay down foil so that your oven will stay clean).
Bake, with the oven door open a crack, at 140Â°F for
8-10 hours.
BUT, be sure to TASTE occasionally, and remove when the
cheweyness appeals to you the most.
Janet usually can't wait the 8 hours, and has found
3-4 hours to be plenty.
*Dedicated to all the jerks I've known in my life. .
Prelude
I sat on the floor and turned the switch off.
The blackness rushs in as if to knock me over. My eyes
are open, but there is nothing; nothing but blackness
and inexistence. The ringing starts in my ears; it
gets louder and louder. The darkness gets heavier and
heavier. A brief moment of panic! Some noise-make some
noise! It brings you from the edge of inexistence to
nothingness.
I try to relax now, but there is a loud pounding
noise! My body is motionless, but the pounding continues.
I suddenly realize I am hearing my heart beati I am.
listening to the very thing that keeps me alive! What
if the noise should stop? Is it possible to hear your-
self die?
I sit and listen. It slows up now; I begin to feel
relaxed. A flick of a switch will take me back to exist-
ence; complete and utter silence will take me to eternal
inexistence.
