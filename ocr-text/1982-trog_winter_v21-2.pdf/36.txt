bopped down two small domes, and came to an abrupt halt at
a depressing little nothing in the floor. But professor,
does this mean ....? I crawled in a bit. Yes, I'm afraid
so .... the Dread Drain Pool. Philip had meanwhile wedged
himself into the top of the miniscule canyon - hope springs
eternal I guess. The pool proved a little less than dread-
ful (only one inch deep), and soon we were crouched at the
head of Kangaroo Canyon. A small pit blocked forward pro-
gress - do we go down or across? I climbed over it and
examined the smooth, foothold-free walls - it looked nasty;
but well traveled .... "Oh Winfield, there's an easy little
climb here." Win struggled down and reported an apparent
no-go. I was glad I hadn't climbed it. We decided to con-
tinue across - a decision that was later to prove fateful.
Shortly we climbed into a fine, dry walkway and sped
down survey; our footfalls sending up silent explosions of
moondust. The walls became studded with huge gypsum flowers
up to 6 inches across, and so crowded together that not a
square inch of rock remained exposed. This beautiful pas-
sage eventually led to a 30 ft deep well - cascades of gyp-
sum sand hissed over the lip as we scouted for a way across.
BLOODY HELL! This shouldn't be here .... the map didn't
show any DAMN pit! Where in the #$%& were we? We climbed
down and were confronted by a confusing network of shaft
drains heading in all directions; most were unsurveyed and
some were not even explored. We inched across crumbly
ledges, hopped down smooth, one-way climbs and dragged
through tiny ragged canyons, transfixed by one thought -
follow the numbers. Hours dragged by as we probed dozens
of leads searching for the elusive numbers. We passed 4 and
5 way junctions and I began to doubt our ability to retrace
our steps. Our only hope was to hit the K survey, which
was the familiar route through the bewildering mess. We
wandered through one unfamiliar survey after another as
patience wore thin and fatigue turned to desparation. WE
WERE LOST! We could rattle around in this maze until some
future survey party set stations on our gypsum-encrusted
bones! Things were bleak indeed when Philip found K24 Smoked
on the wall - JUBILATION! We stumbled into Pirates Pot,
our original destination, after 5 long hours knowing that
we still had 5 more hours to go before we could survey.
The hike out Lower Black River was uneventful and
monotonous except for the water. Foaming torrents of muddy
icewater gushed in from every available side passage. Nor-
mally tame Black River was swollen to a full 2 ft deep and
tugged relentlessly at our footing. We had to duck past
several thundering domes, and some of the passage reminded
me of a sinking German U-Boat. As we neared the turnoff
to the B.W.O.B., the broad, normally shallow, . pools were
up over the ledges, and a deafening roar echoed out of the
darkness in front of us. We ran into Tom at the climb up
into the B.W.O.B. ; where the climb should have been, a
tremendous twin waterfall filled the passage. The normal
