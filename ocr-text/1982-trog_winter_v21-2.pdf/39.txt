Startin' your car when the mercury's far
below the freezin' point,
Is not what I'd do, I'll tell you
if I could be in a warm beer joint!
And to sit in the cold of this land
so bold ain't really much fun,
But fun or no (I'm telling you so)
it's something that must be done!
But when you're skiing alone and the daylight's flown
and it's somehow wrong to sing,
Then the silence roars 'til your spirit soars
to the peaks that 'round you ring.
The woods! The stars! The land! The bars!
Come up; I'll e'en ask ya!
Come up and look 'round, then you'll have found
that I'm right - That's Alaska!

Good sound, good show,
Good friend, the Radio.
Good chips, good cheese,
Good munchies, these!

Good friends, good beer,
Good drugs, what cheer!
Good leaves, good seed,
Good no-shit weed!
Good whiskey, good rye,
Good questions: "How?", "Why?"
