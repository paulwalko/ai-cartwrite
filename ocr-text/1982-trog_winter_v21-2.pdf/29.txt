This system utilizes sling, rope, or avalanche cord as
the belay to which the cup is tied in at either one or
two points. The cup can be attached to the belay either
by an approved knot (Good for the glass mugs. See Figure
2) or through the use of bolts, hangers, and carabiners
(See Figure 3).
Another technique is the Simple Dynamic Cup Belay
(SDCB). Rather than using the same materials as the belay
in the SSCB, this method employs shock cord (see Figure
Figure 3:
4). When a mug is composed of a brittle substance, this
Double bolts
technique can reduce the shock from any fall, thus length-
ening the life of your drinking vessel.
At the other end of the expense
spectrum is the Adjustable Cup Belay (ACB). In this
system a rope is rigged to the neck and the cup is
clipped into a Gibbs stop cam. A figure-of-eight on
a bight is tied in the end of the rope to keep
it from slipping off in case of
of failure (See Figure 5).
This is obviously the Cadillac
of the cup belays. It can be
adjusted for various positions
(close to your waist when actively
participating; down at your
knees when slow-dancing to
allow for proper dancing con-
tact). Also, others can use

your belay even if they aren't
the same height as you. This is
especially helpful in situations
where an untrained drinker (i.e. trainee) is in danger and
prone to an accident. It may be difficult to use a custom-made
SSCB or SDCB in this type of situation. Jumars or Prussiks can
be used in place of the cams in the ACB, but keep in mind
that cams work even on muddy or icy ropes.
In conclusion, we feel that Cup Belay Techniques have
advanced to the point to which only a minimal amount of beer
should be lost in a party. Also, the latest advances, while
improving the belay, have not greatly increased the price of
drinking. Safe drinking is now within our capabilities and
resources.
