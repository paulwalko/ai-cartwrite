76
** ALASKA**
I started forth and headed up North
merely on a whim,
To see for myself this frozen shelf;
much lauded as in a hymn.
So here I came seeking fortune and fame
(or enough to get me home!),
I didn't shirk but found some work
not far from Murphy's Dome.
The summer sun never gets quite done;
shines down all nice and warm,
But oh, dear Lord! Get rid of this hoard
of mosquitos that 'round me swarm!
There are wondrous masses of clouds that pass
in the big, blue sky
And the stars at night are so goddamned
bright as to look in your mind and pry!
The mountains rear to the South of here
and reach beyond the sky,
Hess, Deborah, Hayes; a finale - bygosh there's
Denali! Twenty thousand feet high.
The rivers race with a right fast pace
from a glacier somewhere behind,
But the rocks are there so better
beware and keep your eye well shined!
The canoe slides through, with a pal and you,
the branches of a big dead spruce;
But the current snatches, a dry branch
catches and suddenly shakes ya loose.
Now there's likker galore and a lotta good
whores down on Street Number Two,
Give 'em the cash and they'll even
thrash with a lad the likes o' you!
When the temperature's down and the clouds all frown,
the snow it's up to your knees;
And the cold wind blows and you'll lose your nose
if you just so much as sneeze.
And the iceworms jeer and laugh so clear
that the frozen tundra rings,
Why, then the huskie howls and the woodsmoke fouls
the crystaline wind-sting.
