at that rate without feeling any effects. But Joe
tends to imbibe at a faster clip which can leave my
liver with an all night job. In fact it was on the
night he won the coveted Brain Bucket award for
smacking up his bicycle and my shoulder, that he
overloaded my liver and pulled ligaments in another
important part of me- my foot.
Joe got a good case of "dancing feet" during the
banquet party. Of course Joe doesn't realize how
complex dancing is for my feet. My heel takes the -
initial shock load which is then transmitted along
my five metatarsal bones to the ball of Joe's foot,
just behind the toes. Finally, with the big toe, I
give a forward thrust. I'm hitting the cement with
a 180 pound jolt about fifty times a minute, and
whoops! There goes my ankle. Now Joe can't go caving
for another few weeks.
With a minimum of care, I can last Joe a lifetime.
Until then, I'll just keep plugging along, getting
dragged through tight cave passage, skinning up my
knees and elbows, getting soaked and cold to the bone
in wet and muddy crawls, and having my eyes dilated
from trying to read a Brunton in the dim light of
a carbide lamp.
