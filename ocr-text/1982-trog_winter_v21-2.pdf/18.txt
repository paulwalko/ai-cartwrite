RECOMMENDATIONS
Inter and transgranular stress corrosion cracking caused the
failure of the brass carbide lamp base at the sharp, strained
bend formed during the making of the part.
A stress relief anneal would most likely be the simplest way
to avoid SCC in the base. This treatment would reduce the inter-
nal stresses at the sharp bend and yet retain the hardness of the
part. A full anneal is not recommended because of the resulting
loss in strength that would result. Addition of arsenic (0.1%),
phosphorous (0.4%), or silicon (2.2%) in small amounts to the
alpha brass creates inhibited brass, which is much more resist-
ant to corrosive attack and could eliminate the problem of
dezincification altogether.
For cavers a simpler solution would be to melt ordinary
lead-tin solder into the bend of the base when the lamp is new.
Care must be taken to keep the heating of the brass to a minimum
or else the brass may dramatically lose strength. Finally, reg-
ular and thorough cleaning of the base, with particular attention
being paid to the crevice at the bottom of the lamp, can extend
the life of the base significantly.
