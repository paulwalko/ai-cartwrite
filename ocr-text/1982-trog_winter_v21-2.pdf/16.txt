Figures 7) top and 8) bottom The central crack in each picture connect
to form a single crack which traversed the entire sample. Top (550X)
shows general corrosion of inner wall. also example of slip plane
corrosion at s. Bottom micrograph (600X) shows outside edge of lamp.
Extensive cracking has occurred over the entire surface-examples at C.
