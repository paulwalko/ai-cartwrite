Self Rescue at Kimbleton Mine
October 25, 1981 saw a real carnival heading into Mine
cave; Pete Sauvigne, (Big) John Lohner, Kent Thompson,
Mike Gaydosh, Steve Lancaster, Lee (air rappel) Little,
Keith (animal) Smith, (Captain) Ed Fortney, Paul Norris,
and inyself. We met at 9:00 at my place and rendezvoused
with Pete at the turnoff this side of Pearisburg. A stop
at the main plant, a walk through white limestone dust,
and we gave the foreman a release form signed by everyone
on the trip.
Kimbleton Mine is an active limestone mine and has two
main portals underground,.. north and sauth. When the mine
was first put into operation the south portal broke into
a cave. The cave was virgin and apparently had no natural
entrance. It caused big problems for miners because every
now and then they would hit a section of the cave which
caused roof collapse and general havoc. Cavers were called
in a year and a half ago when a lower portion of the mine
began flooding. Pete Sauvigne and Bob Alderson, both of
whom had been in the cave before, began trying to trace the
stream to a place it could be blocked, but to no avail.
Apparently the floodwaters were coming from a separate
source. As a result the south portal was impassable and
was used only for ventilation.
Enter: Cavers! Trips, however, were only allowed on
Sundays because of. blasting the other six days, and per-
mission could only be obtained by select people.
. As we entered the thirty foot archway entrance of the
south portal, a deep gloom settled around us. Voices
became hushed and visibility went down to twenty feet.
A hundred feet down the roadway a "streetlight" became
visible and you felt as if you were in London on a foggy
night. The gloom was limestone dust, thick in the air.
The underground chill added to the effect.
By this time the ceiling was no longer visible and the
road seemed like it would stretch on forever. Another
"streetlight" glowed feebly in the distance but it was time
to turn off the road and clamber over some large pipes
into a breakdown area on our right. As we stumbled over
rocks and visibility reduced to ten or fifteen feet, we
became aware of a wall on our right and avoid on our left.
Another fifty feet up a mud slope and we reached the base
of a wooden ladder punching its way up through the fog into
a circular hole in the ceiling. Thirty vertical feet later
I was in a completely different world. The air was clear,
the temperature was 54 degrees, and the walls were familiar
sleazy mud! Nine more people up the ladder and we started
chimneying across pits
