route was totally obscured by the thundering water, so we
had to do a tricky wall-climb nearby. Tom helped us up the
waterfall and headed out. We ducked past an upper water-
fall, and shortly reached Fairyland. The low flowstone pas-
sage had become a flowing sump (.8 cfs) and was met with a
mixed reaction of disappointment and relief. We wondered
what would have happened if we hadn't been lost for 4 hours'.
We could have ended up on the far side of that sump. We
owed our salvation to Winfield for missing the way in that
little pit we had crossed hours before. .
Back at Pirates Pot we managed to find the correct
route into Kangaroo Canyon, and plodded toward the Weller
Entrance. We had been on the move for over 12 hrs and had
been wet for most of the time. Our buns were definitely
beginning to drag, but we were only a ê hr from the entrance.
We ran into Tom again; he was soaked and looked worried.
He reported that the entrance had sumped 50 ft from the. sur-
face! OH SHIT! The Main Entrance was 4 hrs away, we had no
vertical gear, and no hope of rescue for several days! I
knew there was a way to bypass the main drop - we just had
to find it. The entrance pit (35 ft) had been free-climbed
before - could it be done in a slushy waterfall? I tried
to put the blacker alternatives out of my mind - we had no
choice but to try.
I stopped worrying in the S - Canyon, my mind becoming
preoccupied with the mechanics of putting one foot or knee
in front of the other. I slipped into a trance-like mode
in this familiar passage - movement became automatic. I
felt sorry for Trex, remembering how interminable this
nasty canyon had seemed on my first trip. We were extruded
into Coalition Chasm (main drop) at 9 am, and began the grim
search for the bypass. Two 70 ft waterfalls plunged down
from above, creating a cold wind - if we failed to find the
way in a few hours we would be forced to retreat to warmer
passage. Win began to build a makeshift prussikrig, while
Philip, Tom and I began working our way to the top of a
high canyon. After nearly an hour of poking around at var-
ious levels, we popped out at the top of the rope. Tom
went to try the entrance climb while Philip and I called
back to the others. We could get no response due to the
deafening roar from the nearby waterfalls. I waited at the
top of the main drop, realizing there was no way I could
climb the entrance without a ladder. Philip continued call-
ing without result - I feared they had fallen asleep. Get-
ting cold, I decided to go for the entrance and was soon
delighted by the sound of a ladder being lowered. Philip
and I made it out by 11:30 am and hurried back to the field-
house for vertical gear. Philip got the gear down the drop
by 12:30 and the others were out by 2 pm. We all breathed
a sigh of relief at having escaped so handily. We began to
realize that good caving alone would not have been suffi-
cient - Dumb luck had played an uncomfortably large role.
Without Tom's report on the Weller Entrance, we could have
easily become too exhausted to make the Main Entrance. Tom
admitted that without our knowledge of Coalition Chasm, he
might not have found the bypass. The Moral is: If a cave
seems to be whispering a warning to you - LISTEN TO IT!!
