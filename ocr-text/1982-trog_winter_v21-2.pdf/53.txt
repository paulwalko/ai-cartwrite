Upon Meeting a Trainee Trip Underground
I stopped just short of the first ledge and waited
for my turn to squirm through the keyhole that led
to the bottom of the nineteen foot drop. A nostalgic
wave swept over me as I sat and listened to the con-
versation up ahead. How excited and intrigued the
voices sounded! How strange their terminology.
Their equipment was crude and their manner of explor-
ation so carefree that it appeared to be utter chaos.
My mind wandered back to high school and my first
trips underground. How excited and intrigued I was.
My equipment was crude - the manner of exploration
carefree. For a moment I tried to think of what right
I had to interfere and change all of this. Who is
to say what is proper?
Where in the past have I encountered myself?
"Good taste, last and vilest of human superstitions,
has at last succeeded in silencing us where all others
have failed".*

Or
â€œYou can make it, but it may be a bit tight..."
We entered then this cozy one,
All set to cave and have some fun;
But shortly things did narrow down,
Until the walls my shoulders found.
My shirt off now -- I'll try again;
Behold, opon the wall my skin!
Methinks that once I exit here,
In direst need I'll be of beer!
