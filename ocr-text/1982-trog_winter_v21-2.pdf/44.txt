A Massachusetts Yankee
at VPI Grotto
Last September, I left the security of New England, the only home
I had ever really known, to attend school at VA TECH. I had always been
active in one club or another during high school and my first two years
of college, but when I came here, I was looking for something new and
different. One day early in October a friend told me that she had gone
to a Cave Club meeting and had had a fantastic time at a party on a moun-
tain and then caving the next day. Now being from Massachusetts, where
caving is an almost unknown sport, (mainly because there are almost no
caves in the state) I was a little wary but decided to try it for the fun
of it. I went to my first meeting Friday, October 9, and was on my way
to becoming a confirmed caver. That following Sunday was the vertical
session and I began to meet some of the most friendly and unusual people
I have ever known.
My first caving trips were the following weekend: a 3 hour trip into
Starnes and a 4 hour trip into Tony's. I was converted! My first vertical
trip was into Pighole and then I realized that it was always meant to be.
Vertical caving gave me such a feeling that I have always been looking
for in a year-round sport. Now you must all understand that being from
New England, I am an ardent skier and every winter that I am away leaves
me longing for the slopes of home. However, I can honestly say that this
winter brought as much fun as ever, even though I skied barely more than
10 days.
Subsequent caving trips have brought me to New Castle Murder Hole,
Spruce Run Mountain and Newberry's, as well as an exciting weekend in West
Virginia. I have loved every minute I have spent underground. Friends
from home have asked "Why would you want to spend a day underground where
it is cold, wet and dark?" I answer with a smile and say, "Come visit and
you'll find out." As of yet, I have not had any takers. In closing, I
would like to thank all of the members of the club for making my adjust-
ment to the South not only easier but a hell of alot of fun.
