Believe it or not, another Trog has
been printed this year, and hopefully con-
tains enough quality material to make it
worth the price. Many thanks go to Law-
rence Britt, Dave Cinsavich, Ed Fortney,
and Keith Smith for help in typing and .
contributing artwork for this issue.
Thanks also go to all people who contri-
buted articles to this issue as well as
the fall quarter issue. Maureen Handler
and Jim Washington will be editors spring
quarter, so the only thing I can say is
to keep caving, keep partying, and keep
writing those Trog articles! We are still
one of the most active grottos in the coun-
try. Over an eleven week period this win-
EDITOR
ter we caved 1545 person-hours on 56 trips. MOL
With that much activity going on under-
ground, and as much shit that goes on a-
round here above ground, there is plenty of material to write about
in the Trog.
Since this page is reserved for my use, I will use it to answer
a few gripes and make a few more. The first gripe I heard about the
fall Trog was that there were a few words in the crossword puzzle that
didn't make sense. Of course they didn't! How do you expect me to
draw up Ã  crossword puzzle and have every word fit? It just happened
that I had to invent some words so the crosswords would fit in. The
next gripe I heard about the last Trog is that it didn't have a
scratch 'n' sniff centerfold. Sorry, but we did try to save some
money. Hopefully this quarter's cover will satisfy you.
Spring quarter is approaching, and as soon as everybody returns
from Florida, Alabama, or crawls out of Roppel, we'll have to con-
tend with elections. As always, I'm sure there will be plenty of
mud slinging, name-calling, screaming, yelling, and people going into
hysterics trying ot chose a new leader and officers. The one import-
ant thing I'd like to point out is whoever runs for office, make sure
you elect people who can work together. It is most important for the
growth of this club that the president and vice-president be friends-
they need to work together to encourage new membership, get club pro-
jects organized, and plan the direction the club will take in the next
year. One added note - thanks goes to Dave for bartending
during this whole ordeal.
