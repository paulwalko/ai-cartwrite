Joe spends vast amounts of time and money on caving
equipment: hard hat and lamp, lugged sole boots,
rappelling and ascending gear, and other assorted
gear. He cares for his ropes and carbide lamps like
they... were babies, washing them after each cave trip,
and storing them properly when not in use. But he
tends to regard me as an ungainly, trouble causing
nuisance. I am Joe's body.* I have been described
as everything from an architectural nightmare to an
anatomical wonder. Joe has no idea what a complex
piece of machinery I really am. He crawls through
Paul Penley's cave trying to contort me to get through
the Crimper or the Fender Bender. Or else he lies
in the wet and muddy Wallow Hollow straining his eyes
to read a dimly lit Brunton compass, his mind pretty
much a blank. Yet a great deal is going on inside me.
First take my collar bone, a single linkage in the
complex bone structure of my shoulder. My collar bone
helps hold my shoulder in place and at the same time
giving it movement and support. But Joe takes one
spill from his bicycle on the way to the Cave Club
picnic, and look what happens- he ends up in the
hospital and is prevented from caving for six weeks.
But that's not where Joe stops. He is continually
overloading my liver, the virtuoso among Joe's organs,
at Friday night parties. The alcohol in Joe's beer
which accumulates in his blood in lethal quantities
is broken down in my liver into harmless carbon dioxide
and water. My liver can handle about three-fourths
of a can of beer in an hour; Joe can go on indefiniteky

* Joe, 24, is a typical VPI caver. A number of his
organs have told their story in previous articles
(with apologies to the Readers Digest).
