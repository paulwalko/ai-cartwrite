RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Macroscopic examination of two failed lamp bottoms showed two types
of cracking on each specimen: longitudinal cracks on the curved face of
the base and circumferential cracks along the bottom lip of the base (See
Figure 2). Since the longitudinal cracks did not cause failure in these
samples they were not examined. The circumferential cracks swept out
nearly ninety degree arcs and ran from the inner surface through to the
outer surface.
A cross sectional view of the entire lamp bottom revealed that the
lower half of the base was formed by a stamping process. This stamping re-
sulted in heavily cold worked grains along the bottom lip of the base, where
the failure occured (See Figure 2, Section A-A). Metallography showed
that the lamp consisted of single phase, alpha brass. It was also noted
that the brass was "dirty", meaning that there was a significant amount
of non-metallic inclusions in the metal. These inclusions, however, were
not believed to play a major role in the cracking of the specimens.
. Both examined sections showed multiple cracks originating from the
inner surface of the lamp. The cracks branched frequently and formed
secondary cracks all along the fracture surface (See Figures 3,5,6;7,8).
The cracks ran intergranularly as well as transgranularly, along slip
planes, and gave rise to a highly faceted fracture surface typical of
brittle failures. Because the cracking occured on the heavily cold worked
edge of the sample and because the crack pattern was brittle in appearance
and highly branched, stress corrosion cracking (SCC) was the suspected
mechanism of failure in this system;
Stress in the base had three sources: 1) Residual bending stresses
from cold work during fabrication, 2) Hard knocking and beating during
usage, and 3) Wedging caused by the formation of less dense corrosion
products at the crack tips. Of these, the bending stresses were the
most important. Microscopically, The residual cold working stresses
manifested themselves as strain markings which appeared in virtually
every grain along the base's bottom rim (see Figure 3). The strain ,

markings, which are dislocation tangles, lie on brass' slip planes.-
Transgranular cracks were observed along the slip planes (See Figure 3).
These cracks appear because of the accumulation of dislocations and the
ease of atom displacement along the slip planes. Residual stresses that
result from cold work processing have been found to cau≈üe SCC in other
alpha brass systems exposed to a corrosive environment.
Sharp blows directly on the critical rim of the base are common
occurences during usage. Rapping the base on rocks and helmets to assist .
cleaning would lengthen pre-existing cracks and expose more surface to
corrosion. A third source of stress was the wedging action that accompanied
the formation of low density oxides on the walls of crack surfaces. The
density of brass is 8.5 g/cc while the density of zinc and copper oxides
are typically 6 g/cc. As the corrosion progressed the volume of the oxide
products increased faster than the volume of the consumed metal decreased,
causing the cracks to open mechanically.
Corrosion in the lamp bottom took two forms. Plug type dezincification
was observed on the inside bottom surface of the lamp, remote from the
fracture (See Figure 4).
