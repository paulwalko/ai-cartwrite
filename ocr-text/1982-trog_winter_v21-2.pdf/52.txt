90
piddly eight foot climb.
Pete started down first and found the rope stretched
about five feet as he went over the lip. He made it down
and swung over fairly gracefully. I was next, so...
"Ready to rappell"
"Belay on!"
"Rappelling!"
Over the lip, down, a not so graceful swing, and I was
next to Pete. The rest of the trip started down. Poor
Mike. He seemed to have forgotten about the stretch in the
rope as he started sitting into the rappel. Crash, bang,
whoops! And there he was, hanging upside down five feet
below the lip. The belayer lowered him and we pulled him
over. The only injury was a bruised ego.
Big John did a close imitation and finally everyone
was on our side of the drop.
A quick conference about the time and Pete decided to
take Steve and Lee out and make a phone call to his wife
Linda.. Our sign-out in Blacksburg was okay, but he had
told Linda we would be out by six. It would be seven
by the time he got to the phone.
The rest of us saundered out (as well as you could .
saunder in this cave). As we climbed over the pipes onto
the mine roadway we had already gotten reaccustomed to the
thick gloom. A few minutes of walking and the entrance
archway glowed ahead. Headlights came on from the arch.
"Hey, what took you so long?" Pete yelled from the
Scout. They had been waiting fifteen minutes after buying
some beer and making the phone call. And to top that off
the inconsiderate bums had already drunk all the beer-
none for us! We considered rolling the Scout on its roof
but someone held me back.
Our trip took almost ten hours. The normal through
trip would have taken about six hours, so we were real
proud of our efforts. Two lessons were to be learned.
The first was that anytime you go down a rope, even if you
don't plan to return that way, take a set of cams. The
second lesson was if you get into a difficult situation,
you have to try hard to not be able to effect a self rescue.
We had several options and the first one worked. If it
hadn't, we would have tried something else. This is much
preferred to calling a rescue.
With high spirits (even with lack of spirits), we changed
and headed back to Blacksburg for food, drink, and sleep
after a trip none of us would ever forget.
