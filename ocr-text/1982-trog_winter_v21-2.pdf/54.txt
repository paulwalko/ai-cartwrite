A SPÃ‰CIAL NOTICE
Recently a rumor reached our grotto that a few individuals, under
the name "Council of Appalachian Volunteers Engaged in Speleology" are
attempting to form a new Southwest Virginia Region of the Nss. The
rumor also stated that two-thirds of the VPI Grotto was in support of
the CAVES group. A brief survey revealed that of all current members
of the VPI Cave Club, only two or three had even heard of CAVES, and
none of these were in support of that group or its political endeavors.
At the 12 March meeting of the VPI Grotto, a motion passed stating
that no person other than an officer of the grotto may use the club name
for any political business without first obtaining the club's permission
at a meeting. Permission will only be given by a majority vote.
Another motion passed, stating that the VPI Grotto is at this time
opposed to the formation of another region of the NSS, and offers no sup-
port to the CAVES group. We want the Virginia region to remain intact.
Sincerely,
Richard A(BOLiza
Richard S. (Boo) Croft
President, VPI Cave Club
VPI 201, NSS 18884
