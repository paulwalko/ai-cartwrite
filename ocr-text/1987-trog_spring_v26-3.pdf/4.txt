The Editor's Column
I must admit that as the end of the quarter approached, I
looked forward to having to edit this Trog with the same sort of
enthusiasm I normally reserve for impending root canal surgery.
It takes a pretty low priority when you've got tests, research
work, and 5 papers screaming for attention, but I think Beth and
I are going to pull this thing off after all, Sincere thanks are
in order for all those who composed articles, bared their
souls, and in some cases, utterly butchered the English language.
We picked up the pieces where we could and when it was needed.
The Trog is, after all, a journal of the activities of our
grotto. This issue's content, I feel, reflects what our
grotto really does: lots of caving, a respectable amount of
partying, and minimal politics. If the absence of the Grotto
Grapevine bothers you, volunteer to write it the next time I beg
you. Other than that, response has been great and, academics
allowing, I'll be editing the next one. See you next quarter.
Until then I'll be in New Hampshire, expanding young minds.
