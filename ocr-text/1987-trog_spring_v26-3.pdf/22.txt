STOMPBOTTOM ACCIDENT REPORT
On Saturday, August 23, three people, Koichiro Takamizawa,
Garrie Rouse, and Joan Johnson went on a survey trip to
Stompbottom. They entered the cave in the early afternoon and
were surveying beyond the Gnarly Hole. Around 5:00 P.M., Ko
began to climb up a pile of breakdown to check a possible lead
when a large rock slipped a few inches, trapping both his feet,
Garrie and Joan worked to free one foot. A half hour later, they
succeeded. At 7:00, they decided to get outside help to move the
rock off Ko's left foot. Garrie left the cave to call for help
while Joan remained with ko.
Garrie tried to call VPI grotto from the caretaker's house,
but was able to contact only Don Anderson and Doug Perkins as
most of the other members were at an OTR work-weekend. He then
contacted CRCN. They arrived at the entrance early Sunday
morning. Meanwhile, the two people in the cave stayed warm with
garbage bags and carbide lamps. Around 3:00 A.M., Ko began to
feel better and decided to relieve the pressure on his ankle by
digging into the ground around it. Because the rock had been
shored up earlier, he was able to dig himself free at 3:30.

Joan and ko ate a hot meal and proceeded to a spot 100 feet.
from the Gnarly Hole. They encountered Garrie there around 4:30.
He said that rescuers were in the cave, but none of them had made
it through the tight crawl. Joan went through the crawl to get a
splint, and left the cave when two small EMTs decided to take the
splint the 150 feet to ko. One couldn't make it through the
crawl. The other one made it through the squeeze but turned
around 100 feet from Ko and Garrie because no one answered his
calls.
CRCN had opened up many of the tight passages in the
cave, but stopped when they were informed the victim could "walk"
out. On the surface they provided hot food and drinks. At 5:45,
they were asked to inform Ko's roommate of the rescue since the
group had signed out with him. CRCN replied that VPI had already
been notified. At 8:00 A.M. Ko's roommate called Jim
Washington. Jin, who was unaware of the situation, started rescue
proceedings. He soon contacted a relative of Don Anderson and
learned that a rescue had been in progress for some time.
Around 6:30 A.M., Ko and Garrie got tired of waiting for the
splint, and exited the crawl without a splint and pushing 5
packs. Ko was able to exit the cave under his own power, and
everyone was out by around 9 A.M.
