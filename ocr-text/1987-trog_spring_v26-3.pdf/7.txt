From Inside the Landslide
Once upon a time there was a course called Landslide
Analysis. Few people signed up for it and consequently it became
an independent study. We spent the first few weeks listening to
lectures and visiting landslides. Before long we had to choose a
particular slide to study. Well there is always the Narrows
slide but it's been analyzed to death. Turns out that there's
nothing that can be done but pray and wait for it to go away.
There are several other mini-slides in the vicinity of
Blacksburg, but none as big and interesting as the one we chose
In a little quarry outside of Blacksburg, Virginia there is
a landslide. Because of the beautiful outdoor setting, complete
with river and forest, and the fact that this slide is no
ordinary slide, being extremely tall and acting strange, we
selected it to be our victim. Several trips to the site
accomplished very little due to several of us gazing off into the
distance and kicking rocks (thinking behavior) while others
chased wildflowers, rattlesnakes, birds, etc.(piddle behavior).
We really had no idea why the mountain was coming down. Tension
cracks along the back of the mountain crest proved it was a big
slide but they didn't act correctly. Usually the ground on the
moving side of the crack is lower but not here. Here we saw the
ground slumped down 4-fti in some areas on the "stable" side of
the mountain. Well we finally came up with the idea of toppling
failure. This would explain the odd cracks but why was the
mountain-side toppling? There had to be some reason, some
undermining going on to cause such a mess.
We had heard there was a cave in the quarry but no one said
much about it. Neither Douglas nor Holsinger mentioned any caves
in the surrounding area. So we didn't give it much thought.
Besides, there weren't any nearby streams or sinkholes to tickle
our fancy. But, finally the cave entrances and quarry benches
caught our gaze. The entrances didn't look that big actually but
there were several little holes on the next bench up (maybe
65-ft). We knew this couldn't be a big cave, possibly a mazys
dusty, nasty tubular SOB. Harboring these thoughts we didn't
worry about getting in the sleazy rat-tunnel very soon. Days
past....
Luckily there were three covers in the group: Gary Rogers,
Steve Dickenson, and myself. I finally convinced Gary that we
should do the dirty deed and see what might be in the mountain.
Being college gradual students we couldn't afford to do an
elaborate analysis of the slide and going in the cave might
reveal some clues as to why the mountain was coming down. Maybe
we could see a slip surface or some mud or something to indicate
movement. From the outside there wasn't much to see, just a
pile of fallen rock. Bore-holes had been drilled years ago but
access to the data was impossible (top-secret among quarries).
Knowing that no quarry owner is crazy enough to go in his own
cave blasting being done all around, and highly fractured rock
ever where) we decided to do him a favor. Besides, if we did find
