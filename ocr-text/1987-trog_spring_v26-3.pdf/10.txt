outside. Having lots of time to see all the formations gave 45
plenty of ooonnn's and aaahhh's. Peter, having never been caving
before, really got a treat and ruined his underwear just as much
as the rest of us. It really was a thrill!
After surveying to the clay and dolomite piles we
took a break to eat lunch. Gary and Peter climbed up the
dolomite pile and disappeared only to call out seconds later to
report that the bigger entrance had been found. Now having our
bearings straight on where we were on the benches we decided to
bop into the nearby big room to see what we could find.
Climbing through the window of columns I found many
stalagmites to climb down on and decided not to use the rope
unless we had to. At the bottom of the 25-ft, drop there was a
big formation about 10-ft. tall, all white, and cracked at the
base. It must have fallen from the ceiling. Being very careful
not to disturb it we climbed down around to the floor and quickly
checked the room out for more possible leads. Off to the left
there was a stream leading into more big passage about 10-ft.
high and 15-ft. wide, Fresh dolomite breakdown was scattered on
the floor so I carefully ran past to push the stream hallway.
Quickly the hall broke into two passages. The stream led to
another caved-in dolomite pile to the left and soon died into a
gnarly crawl. To the right the hall went up and over a flowstone
mound and continued. After climbing up and over I found another
stream and pushed it to another sump, Above this there was
another passage that seemed to get back into the multilevels that
we had suspected all through the cave but seen broken on the
floor,

Running back to the others we finished surveying the.
available big stuff and made lots of notes on what we had seen.
In one spot there were beautiful white and rust curtains (bacon
rinds) which Steve attempted to play as an experienced
Rasta-Callipso musician would. Sounded pretty good; if only we
had a tape recorder. Elsewhere there were still toos of
formations which we had become accustomed to and actually jaded
by, Caving doesn't get any better than this and any other cave
would pale by comparison. This place truly was amazing.
After 6.5-hours of eyes popping out of our heads and
shouting "OH MY GOD!!, LOOK AT THIS!!" we finally decided to
finish up and go to the VPI picnic at Buddy's. Actually we had
gotten pretty comfortable with running through big impressive
hallways and simply hated to push any nasty leads. Climbing back
to the first dolomite pile we continued surveying up and out to
the second entrance. We kept surveying across the bench to the
first entrance to tie up the loop and call it a day. What a day!
Feeling as if we were on top of the world we unsleazed and
regarbed for the ride home. Comfortably numb we wondered what
would happen to the Big Boomin' Bertha,
