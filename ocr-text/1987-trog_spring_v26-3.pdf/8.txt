any clues then it would make our analysis look much better than
that based on surface data and hypothetical BS. What the hell,
we had permission to study the benches, so why not from the other
side.
Friday, May 8, 1987, Gary and I checked in with the
plant "geologist" as usual and stopped by to talk to the blasting
manager. There being no blasting plans for the day we set out on
our mission. Arriving at the benches we took our time gearing
up, trying not to attract much attention and checking out the
scene for nearby officials. We knew if we were to ask permission
it would be denied and the cave might be blasted shut (there
being drillers on the upper bench preparing for just that
purpose). We also thought that if anyone knew then they would
assume some responsibility for our welfare and we didn't want to
blame anybody else for our craziness. (Later we read in the
Virginia Cave Protection Act that anyone asking permission from
an owner to enter his cave relieves all liability from the
owner.) Of course my roommate, Jim Washington, knew where we
were in case anything were to happen and we didn't show up at
the cave club meeting that night. So all was set.
Casually working our way across the bench, pointing at this
and that, stopping to act as if we were studying the rock, we
approached the smaller entrance. Once out of site from the
drillers I climbed up to the cave while Gary stayed behind to
give them something to look at. I felt the cave's cool breeze
blowing wildly and my nostrils soon perked up to that wonderful
smell of speleoaroma. Lighting my lamp I looked around one last
time for any visitors, Everything seeming perfect, drillers busy
above, beautiful day outside, and a few hours ahead to kill this
gnarly-hole; I peered inside.
To my surprise the little entrance wasn't that little, being
about 8-ft, in diameter. Within a big mountain it seemed small
from a distance. Looking inside I couldn't see anything at any
distance. Checking my lamp proved that it was well lit and that
booming passage was actually what I saw cor didn't see), "Gary
get the Hell over here now!! This ain't no little save!!" He
grinned from ear-to-ear and bopped up to the entrance. Our
hearts began to skip beats and adrenalin started pumping wildly.
A few feet inside we saw beautiful white formations covering the
walls. The passage was about 15-ft, in diameter and sloped down
into the mountain. The floor was obviously break down and looking
up we could see what used to be another level that had collapsed.
The ceiling was incredible with white and rust colored
stalactites floor sloped downward while the ceiling rose up
guiding us into a very large cave, Awesome!
Further up ahead the floor took a dramatic 45-degree plunge
while the ceiling seemed to do the same. In front of us the
darkness looked like a pit as it sucked up all the lighting we
could muster. The drilling sounds were too close for comfort to
remain at the top for any length of time so we had to move on
quickly. The steep slope covered with blocky mud made descending
very uneasy. In front of us we could see that the entrance hall
