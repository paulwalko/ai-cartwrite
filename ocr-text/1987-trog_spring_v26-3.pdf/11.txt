Being a cave in a quarry and poked full of holes from above
did not seem a pleasant fate. But the owner will do what ever he
wants with the cave so there is no sense in trying to cause a
fuss. We decided to let him know the danger he was in by
drilling above such huge voids. We thought by telling him of
these dangers he would let us return to survey as much of the
cave as possible. This would at least satisfy our interests and
be able to calm his nerves. If the right blast were to knock out
the support for the whole mountain then all Hell would break
loose. So bright and early Monday morning we had a meeting.
After explaining to the owner about how beautiful his cave
was and what eternal profits could be made from commercialism we
heard his story. It seems commercial Caves can't employ a few
hundred good men and plans for future mining were already well
underway. Even reclamation of the area had been designed and
there was nothing that could be done. Even if the cave could be
saved there's still the landslide above and lots of old and new
breakdown inside. Our survey only covered 1000-ft. and that
certainly couldn't support a commercial operation. With all the
cards against us we heard the final "BOOM"!! The Big Boomin'
Bertha became a Little Squeazin' Jenny. Life and death of a
cave. What a shame, At least we've got a good slide show and
cave map to show for our efforts. Well, some of us lived happily
ever after.

tion on certain mental functions. Studia Psychologica,
1975, Vol 17(3), 239,243. —Six spelunkers (mean age, 23
yrs) remained in an underground cave*for 6 days. 18
measurements of psychophysiological functions, mental
processes, and personality traits were made to test the
effect of load (harsh climatic conditions, changes in
diurnal biorhythms, and lack of work activities) on
anxiety, social fear, rigidity, and short-term memory.
Tests were conducted on the 1st day of descent and
immediately after ascent. Deterioration was seen only in
short-term memory and eye-hand coordination. Anxiety
and rigidity decreased. -M. Ellison-Pounsel.
* Good thing they weren't in an above-ground cave.
