didn't end in a pit but it was deep. Finally reaching the bottom
we were 80-ft. below the entrance. Above our heads stood a
massive archway covered with anthodites, helictites, soda-straws,
and stalactites. They were everywhere, white and rust colored
formations, even all over the floor. The passage ended abruptly
at a massive wall but quick searching found the best possible
lead to the right. Climbing over delicate formations, "crunch,
crunch, " we stood at the end of a beautiful hallway. The passage
was about 20-ft. high, 15-ft. wide, covered with amazing
formations, and there was no end in site.
Chimneying down to floor level I ran ahead as Gary picked
his chin up off the floor. Bop, bop, bop and then I stood at the
end of the big hall, about 250-ft. away. From there I could see
two great leads. Turning around I went back to find Gary burning
up film. The camera flashi seemed like a strobe light
illuminating pretties in every direction. The ceiling, the
walls, and the floor were all covered with fantastic formations.
Virgin passage never looked so sweet! The ceiling and floor were
flat creating a big trapezoid passage, framing columns 20 to
30-ft. high,
Posing for a few shots I stopped to catch my breath and
tried to pry Gary away from his camera. He finally stopped at
the end of the roll and joined me to see the what other treasures
we could find. After several 0ooohhhh's and aaaahhhn's we
finally go to the two promising leads. Taking the easier one we
ended up in a room almost filled with caved-in material: a pile
of stiff clay, and one of dolomite. Obviously these came from
some upper break-in. After taking a few more pictures and
finding no big promising leads we decided to try the other
passage we had raced by previously. The next portal was situated
between a cascade of white columns. Climbing up to Ã¤ window we
could barely see the opposite wall in the room, being the largest
room we had seen thus far, possibly 30-ft, in diameter and 50-ft.
high. Looking around the room we saw no leads, and below our
window there was a very steep 25-ft.drop. Having no rope and
needing to meet the rest of our group outside we left the "cream
dream" behind. It took us 2 hours to get this far and only 20
minutes to get back out.
Outside the cave we felt like we had conquered the world.
It's not often you see virgin passage this spectacular. We made
it back to the bronco and lit cigars. Wallowing in our bliss we
waited for the rest of the group to show up. Once they showed we
couldn't stop talking; we had to return. So plans were made to
bring ropes, plenty of light, food, water, film, and survey gear.
Surveying the cave would add an impressive touch to the
independent study and would shed some light on the causes for the
landslide; remember the landslide?
The next day we returned with Jim, Steve, and I surveying
while Gary and Peter Forrest photographed. This time we had lots
of light illuminating twice as many pretties as before. Surveying
allowed us to really take in the view and since it was Saturday
we didn't have to worry about any drillers above or visitors
