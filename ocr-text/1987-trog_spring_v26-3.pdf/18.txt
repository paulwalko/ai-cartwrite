Cow Tails
Although "Cow tails" or "rabbit runners," as the climber
types prefer to call they are not a necessity to the typical.

rigging. A COW tail is nothing more than a carabiner at the end
of a 2 to 3 foot saftey line attached to your seat. Some people
tie two of these, one being 1 ft. 10ng and the second about 3

I otten tie a loop with the free end of my rigged rope 50
that a person rigging onto the rope can clip in and do so
safely. It is also helpful for people stuck at a lip. Often
times a person can clip COW tail into the loop at the top and
simply derrig the problem cam ar kinot. This method is much
eaiser than attepting to attach a fourth climbing device above
the lip when your full weight is on it. The colm täil also adds a
sense of security when you are vertical caving in large groups.
I often clip myself in when helping someone negotiate a lipy or
when catching packs or gloves being tossed at me. Alsoy į t .

a rappel. his allows my hands to be free, and sy center of gra-
vity to be much closer to the rope, minimizing the risk of FI iFi-
ping due to being top heavy.
The most extreme use of cow tails is during a bolt clinks of
traverse. This is when two different lengths of cow tail come in
handy. This system allows you to move from bolt to blot safely
with a self belay. I find it liseful when rockClimbing, too.
It's a great feling to pull the last part of a pitch and be able
to clip your cow tail into a friendly belay bolt and rest!
They work as a cable ladder self belay, and in certain
situations, can be used for other things. Thus, there are many
reasons why 50% tails are liseful. Best of all, they've cheap. To
make a perfect set all you need is about 10 Feet of Wobbing, 2
non-10cking carabiners (they snap in quicker), a locking D
binery and some duct tape (to attach them to the 11.10 so that
they don't slip around, and can be rigged in in a hurry. Alsoy
don't make them any longer than you can reach! I'll be glad to
discuss any questions at the next bridge session.
