Are
You an
Old-timer ?
Banquet, picnic, float trip, and Halloween are times when
people who you never see at any other time of the year show up
and party. Many of these people fit into the category of "Oli
Timer." But what, exactly, is an old timer? "How can I be one ,
too?" Well, not being an old timer myself, I can't tell you how
to become one, but I can give you a few identifying
characteristics. If you fit more than half of the list below,
then you are well on your way to becoming an old timer.
