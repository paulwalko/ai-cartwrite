Scott Hollow Trip Report

At one of the Friday night Cave Club meetings before
Christmas, I said to Walt Pirie, "If you want to go caving over
Christmas, give us a ring." "Ring-ring," was Walt's reply. "How
about going on Christmas day?" After a brief consultation with
Bobbie, it was decided, and we made plans to go.
Bobbi, our daughter Shana, and I picked up Walt at about
7:00 a.m. and drove to Sink's Grove, WV, near Lewisburg. Sink's
Grove, as most cavers know, is the home of Bob & Bob's Cavers.
Serving Cavers), although you must know what you are looking for,
because the place is cleverly designed to look like a broken-
down, abandoned, old building with no sign outside. After some
pictures in front of Bob & Bob's (not many people can claim
that), we proceeded to the cave owner's farm.
The male owner (a caver) was at the barn, about 1/4 mile
away, down a 4 inch deep mud lane. Cows need to be milked, even
on Christmas! After cementing relations with the owners, and
tracing part of the excellent map they have of the cave, we
procedded to the entrance.
First, a little about the cave's history. It has been known
for years that there are caves somewhere in the area of Sink's
Grove. Specifically, it has been strongly suspected for many
years that this particular farm has a large cave. The hydrology
of the area indicated such, but no cave on the farm has been
found. A little over two years ago, the caver/farmer decided he
would "take the bull by the horns." He brought in a backhoe and
started digging at a likely low spot on the farm where water
seemed to disappear quickly into the ground.
Within a few feet, he had opened a cave entrance! Because
the area was low and much water passed through it, he had trouble
keeping an entrance open, It kept caving in. So, he acquired a
piece of 3 foot diameter culvert pipe, dug out the entrance more,
and stuck it in the ground 25 far down as it would go. Because
of the low level of the area around the entrances he plans to
eventually to fill the area in around the pipe. In the meantime,
there is a pipe sticking out of the ground straight up about 15
feet. Steel reinforcing bars are stuck through holes punched in
the pipe to supply rungs on the inside and difficult steps to
climb on the outside. In rereading this passage, the entrance
doesn't sound too difficult, but it is, believe me. From the top
of the pipe to the floor of the cave is about 40 feet, through
(at least on the day we went in) a modest waterfall.
Scott Hollow Cave has been opened a little over two years,
and since then miles have been mapped. It is difficult to know
how much larger the cave is, or whether it connects with another
system, but it is clear that it is a world class cave of epic
proportions. Much of the couple of miles which we traversed was
perhaps 100 feet high and we encountered a great deal of
breakdown. There are many active formations and water runs
through all of the cave we saw. As you may remember last year's
Christmas season was a wet one, so it was natural for the cave to
be wet. We suspect, however, that Scott Hollow is wet most of
the time. After going through a part of the cave with
particularly high ceilings, Walt mentioned that we hadn't yet
seen the "big stuff."
