. The club has seen some fun caving in the last year. Although
the student membership has not increased greatly, those members
who are around are doing a lot of caving, and more importantly,
they are doing it together. In the past year we have had two club
trips to Mexico, one to the cockpits of Jamaica, not to mention
Alabama and numerous West Virginia trips. In fact, there have
been so many VPI Cavers involved on these trips, that we actually
had a quorum of voting members during our rendez-vous in
Tamapatz! These trips are the exceptions, however, as we have had
an abundance of trips each weekend.
This year I would like to continue the spirit of group
involvement, and perhaps have a few planned club outings in the
fall. For example, a club invasion of Lockridge-Aqua campground
for a weekend would provide us with some excellent caving, 35
well as partying! Such a trip would certainly be fun for every
caver, and it would hopefully spark some perspective member
interest as well. A good work weekend at the OTR site or for
a local land owner could be another possibility to get the whole
club together and involved. Of course, our re-scheduled practice
rescue in late October will also hopefully spark some good
involvement.
These trips would also help out in our efforts to attract
more students to the club. In case you haven't noticed, we are
going to lose some good cavers this year to graduation/migration
this summer, Thus, I would like to see as many people as
possible help Paul and myself in taking trips next year.
These weekend trips, combined with good parties will also serve
to combine the perspective members with the active student
members and the non-student members who are not highly active at
present. I know that I learned a lot from the long standing
members of the club when I was a trainee, but it was not always
easy to get them to take me caving. Hopefully there will be more
opportunities for new members next fall.
Finally, I would like to see more caving projects started
this year, wheather it be surveying, ridge walking, or just
talking to land owners, I find it is a lot more interesting when
your saving party has a purpose. So for now, let's enjoy the
summer with some excursions to Tinker Cliffs, Friar's hole,
Ellison's, and Fern; but keep thinking of some neat ideas for
club trips/parties in the fall!
