abseiling and the other for ascending. Reggie and I bopped it
twice. This pit made me abandon the Whillan's sit harness that
Sue had loaned me. When I made frog motion, it did strange
things to the groin area. Not advised. When I got to the top of
the pit, I found that I had pinned Ferg to the ground. He had
started to rig in while I had started to climb. Ooops, We were
all ready to leave in the gloaming, when Reggie said he couldn't
pull the rope out of the pit. It was stuck!!! It was decided
that ko would go back down and rectify the situation. He did so
and reported that the rope had tied an overhand knot by itself
around a log. Reggie and I ran down the mountain without lamps
as the last rays disappeared. We almost killed ourselves,
Gary had spent the day at "the morgue," an entrance to a cave
named Fern. When he arrived, the caravan journeyed to the
campground. This was not a trash pile. Instead, we found
Alabama rednecks playing bad music, The rednecks had a bonfire
and we started one of our own, Reggie climbed a tree with Paul's
machete and went crazy. There followed a pseudo party. Jim Beam
and wine were passed around in quick succession. Everyone got
drunk I think, I went to sleep early. (Ed. note: It's known as
"passing out!")

Sunday was too nice a day for anyone to go inside a cave.
Everyone opted for open-air pits. First we went to VAST. It was
a small group: Doug Perkins, Cecile, Reggie and I. Cecile's
Le Car made it thru some giant mud puddles. We parked in a power
line right-of-way and started hiking down the side of a very
steep mountain. It was total bushwack. We followed blue flags
tied around trees. The pit entrance to VAST is a tiny hole. We
rigged and rappelled into what was a very dark, very wet, and
very deep pit. It was listed as 215 feet, but Doug said his rope
made it look more like a 250 footer, Reggie had lost his Petzel
and tried to ascend with a 2 gibbs frogger. It worked more like
a knot system and it took him an hour to get out. The hike back
was interesting. Cecile had gone on ahead. She left a trail of
crackers and beer for us to follow. Doug picked up the beer. We
sat around in the sun for awhile and drank soda pop. Cecile said
she liked VAST a lot.
With time for another pit, our group of four headed for Vahalla.
We met Jerry & crew leaving. They drove to the top. We decided
to make the long hike and spare the vehicles any further damage.
After 2 miles along an unsurfaced road we arrived. There was
little light left. We quickly rigged. I bounced it and then
went back down to do some exploring. Jim Washington and others
came and double rigged the pit. Doug abernathy and Mike Fiore
rappelled to join me, Cecile and Reggie. Vahalla is an
incredible pit. It just looks powerful and impressive. Big
humongous blocks of breakdown are lying all around. The pit made
me a bit nervous. I could see dangerously loose rock hanging off
the sides. Nevertheless, we all survived and made Gary coil the
rope.
