The experience of being in a newly discovered cave is a
difficult one to describe. The knowledge that a relatively few
people have ever walked on the spot on which you are walking, and
that in some remote side room you may be the first person to ever
walk there, is a thrilling one. We saw only a small part of
Scott Hollow Cave, but we hope to see more of it in times to
come.
After about 6 1/2 hours in the cave, we came out at about
7 p.m. It is quite an experience to go down the outside of the
culvert pipe in the dark when your carbide lamp has gone out in
the strong wind. Anyway, we dressed quickly and took off for our
next adventure.
We had reservations at 8:30 Dom, at one of the U.S.'s few
five star restaurants, The Greenbriar, in nearby White Sulphur
Springs, West Virginia. At least it looked on the map to be
nearby. Unfortunately, West Virginia roads, as all of you know,
are often not as good as the maps show. And we could hardly go
to the Greenbriar dressed as we were in our "coming out of the
cave clothes." As we entered the town of White Sulphur Springs
we found a motel, as we had planned to do, and asked to rent a
room so we could shower and change to our Greenbriar dinner
clothes. The motel office was in a building nearby which also
controlled gas pumps, so it was not exactly a Marriott, but it
looked presentable enough. Besides, by that time, we had only
half an hour to shower, change, and get to the Greenbriar nearby.
The person who was to check us in to the motel suggested
that instead of renting a room for the night that we just rent
the motel's shower room, a regular room used by truckers for
showers. When we asked how much the shower room would cost, the
answer was "$4.00." "Each?" we asked. "No, for the four of
you," was the reply. The irony of paying one dollar for a place
to clean up to have a dinner costing many, many times that was
not lost on any of us,
From a world class cave to a world class restaurant was
almost too much for one day but we enjoyed both of them. We got
to the restaurant just in time, ate more than we should have of
some of the best food any of us had encountered to that time, and
drove back to Blacksburg, arriving at about midnight. It will
take a great deal to dislodge Christmas 1986 from our memories.
