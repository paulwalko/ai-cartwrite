On the drive back to camp that night we were attacked by
Stringfellow's truck. He stopped in front of us on a hill to
pow-wow and his truck started rolling back at us. After a
spastis series of events, no one died and we continued. At camp
that night, Paul rigged a tyrollean that sort of worked. A party
followed. I, of course, had sense and went to sleep. Others,
including Doug Perkins, had no sense and got drunk. They
realized I was not present and came over to sing "Amazing Grace".
to me. I can think of more unpleasant things they could have
done. After that, we took pictures of Paul. He was drunk and we
piled up beer cans on his head.
Monday morning was slow, Reggie, Cecile and I decided to go to
Fern Save and bop Surprize Pit. We got there, parked, and hiked
up the mountain to the waterfall entrance. It was a little bit
of a shock getting back into a muddy stream crawl after a nice
days of fun in the sun. Our guide, Paul Smith, zoomed on ahead.
We followed slowly, trying not to get our feet wet. We got to a
precipice with a bolt but did not see any rope. This situation
forced us to backtrack and check out some side leads. Eventually
we said frick and came back out of the cave. Shortly thereafter,
Paul Smith came out and informed us he had already bounced the 14
pit. Apparently, we had gone too high and missed the hairy ledge
that he had forgotten to tell us about, Cecile decided not to go
back in. Getting better directions, I went back in and found the
rig point. I waited awile, nobody showed up, so I went ahead and
started down. It was too dark to see anything. All I had was 3
Durabeam. The noise from a tremendous waterfall was overwhelming.
Surprise Pit is 404 feet deep and it took about 15 minutes to
rappel since I couldn't see the bottom until I got there. With
my feet on cave floor, I changed over to my frog system while
getting wet from the spray, I thought I would ascend in two
stages because the 200 foot pits we had been doing did not
require a rest. I was totally wrong. Without any reference
point or gauge to measure progress I had to break the climb up
into iterations of 20 with a couple breaths in between. At last,
I was over the ledge and walking back up the stream to the
outside. I found my pack, washed my hair in the waterfall, and
started the hike back down the mountain. The Alabama trip was
over.
