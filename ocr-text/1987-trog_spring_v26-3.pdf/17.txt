Whiteside Mtn. Trip
WHITESIDE MOUNTAIN - Approx. 4500 feet. Near Highlands, N.C.
Highest shear cliffs in Eastern North America. Open April -
December. Accessable via U.S. 64.
Whiteside is a 6-7 hour drive from Blacksburg. I met Paul
Smith and Ray Siegary, who had just returned fromã tremendous
trip-push to survey to Ocatempa in Mexico - Known to Belgians as
Pasa Verde. Ray's brother Chris joined his for the pappel. We
lised a 750. rope borrowed from M. Smith of Knoxville on the
condition "yoli frayı Yol pay."
The rape was rigged from a tree at top with a rebelay on a
sloping ledge about 100" down - through a drop of about 600. Or
50. There was only about 10. left Over on the bottomRay did
the ledge rigging. We used radias when they worked because it
was qui
dy on the ledge, but the rope didn't flaila areat:
deal.
After Ray went down, I rigged in and dropped down to the
rebelay. Through some fluke twist of rope, i7iy rack ended
turned sideways and I had a slow ride down. Ray was waiting at:
the bottom grining at my slow decent. He had the same thing
happen in Fantastic. Pall followed me - whizzing down the rope
- both he and Ray were in prime condition after clambering up
and down many ropes in Ocatempa Ray then clipped in and
Climbed Out, not in any hurry while we enjoyed the cool breeze
and I dried off the sweat of pulling myself dowin 600: !

The radios began working very poorly but we finallyeste-
blished that Fay was sending his brother down and that we were
to keep a tight belay on him. Chris, however, didnt seem to
need any extra concern. He derigged and began his 1000 Walk Out
since the didn't have vertical gear,
I began the climb up. The first couple of hundred feet Om
so were near the face enough to interfere with easy climbing.
It was great to have such a good view of a magnificent rock face
twisted and tortured by metamorphic forces, but it was sad to
50e the defacement of many bolts. It almost could be inter-
preted that this face is the practice field for all those learn..
ing to set bolts.
Finally I scrambled over a major bulge and reached the free
area ( about 300'), a glorious View hanging in Space looking
over the valley out to mountain range after mountain range. I
was in 10 hurry since only Paul was behind me. I 1.15ed mly jest
time to take in the panorama - observing rock climbers on the
face to the north, and those on the observation deck a barely
discernable distance away.
