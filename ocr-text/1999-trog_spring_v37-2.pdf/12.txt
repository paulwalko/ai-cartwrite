more than you would think. I remember a fellow caver
who rigged a 400' rope at a 500' cliff intending to do a
change over at the bottom and climb back up only to
discover he had left his ascending gear at the top. His
friends at the top had no way to get the gear to him. In
this case he had his safety ascender with him and the
rope was mostly against the cliff. He was able to free
climb some with the use of the safety and where the
rope was away from the cliff face he used leg wraps to
move himself up the rope.
Like the old caver joke says, “How do I get to Carnegie
Cave? Practice, Practice, Practice.” This is the single
most important thing you can do to avoid problems
when doing vertical work. I know cavers who have
caved for years and have never used a rack or climbed
with a ropewalker. You should familiarize yourself with
all of the commonly used vertical systems. Even if you
don't plan on using them yourself your knowledge may
help prevent someone else from getting into trouble.
There are lots more stories out there that I've heard and
maybe someday I'll have the time to write them down
for Part II. But in the meantime CAVE SAFELY.
