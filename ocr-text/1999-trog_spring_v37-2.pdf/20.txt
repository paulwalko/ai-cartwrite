pectation of a long trip the next day.
Steve Knutson led us to the Monkey River entrance the
next day. Even with him leading the way we still spent
some time locating the entrance. Sometimes just finding
the way from one island of rock in the karst to another
took a few minutes. Once at the cave we changed into
our warm cave gear in the blazing sun. My black suit be-
came an oven in no time. I rigged the rope and wasted
no time rappelling into the cave.
Before long Blair, Garry, Edd and the McCormicks
were in the cave as well. We negotiated the second drop
and then split up. Edd and the McCormicks were
checking leads closer to the entrance. Blair, Garry, and
I were going further into the cave. We made our way
passing landmarks that had been described to us that
morning. Finally we reached a room that contained a
squeeze that would take us to the leads we were to
check. The problem was finding the squeeze in this
room full of breakdown. We must have spent half an
hour looking for it. Finally, I found a crevice between
two huge blocks of breakdown. There was a hint of air
moving through the crevice. I honestly hoped that this
was not the way on, but I went in anyway. Once I had
my whole body in the fissure I slid to the bottom of it.
Here I found some space off to one side. I slowly rotat-
ed my body into it. This space was directly beneath one
of the huge blocks. I was just glad it was large enough
for me to get my face away from the rock. Once free of
the squeeze I slid down a slope and found going stream
passage. This was the way. I called out to Garry and
Blair.
Blair took one look at the squeeze and stated that he
would not fit. Garry and I talked him into making an at-
tempt. Blair got into the squeeze. He made good
progress at first and then not so good. I started encour-
aging him and giving him advice. Blair then indicated in
no uncertain terms that it would be better if I was quiet.
Garry took over the verbal work, but could not talk him
through. Blair backed out and let his brother have a go
at it. Garry made it through the squeeze with some ef-
fort. He then talked Blair into the fissure again, but with
no more success than before. Garry and I made our way
back through the squeeze. I had a lot more trouble com-
ing out, but this was entirely my own fault. I had stuck
my Mag-Lite in the breast pocket of my cave suit while
waiting in the stream passage.
We ate our lunch in the breakdown room. This was to
be our turn-around point. There was a palpable tension
between the two brothers. I made a few attempts at
conversation and gave up. We finished lunch in silence.
When we met up with Edd and the McCormicks they
had mopped up all their leads. Everyone started to head
for the surface, but I convinced Edd to check out some
more of the cave with me. We went looking for another
entrance we had been told about. The entrance eluded
us, but we saw a lot more cave before we ascended to
the surface.
Back up top we discovered that some rodents had made
lunch of my T-shirt. Garry's GPS case apparently tasted
good as well because it had also had nibble marks. We
all hurried back to camp as light faded from the sky.
Navigating the karst by headlamps alone would have
been a challenge.
Not everyone was back at camp. Steve and some others
were surveying and would not come back until dawn.
The rest of us celebrated the Fourth of July as best we
could. We had the campfire and some liquor. Then we
began eyeing four old mattresses that had been dragged
out of the Forest Service shed. They had definitely
served as home for some small creatures in winters past.
Now they were going to serve as our fireworks display.
I was reminded of the furniture burned at Bat Ranch
parties in Virginia. This was going to be a little touch of
home. One by one the mattresses were dragged onto
the fire. Unfortunately they were not made of synthetic
materials but of cotton and on top of that they were
damp. As a result our mattress fire never reached the
roaring inferno stage. With some poking though, they
burned well enough. We kicked back and talked and
watched the glowing red springs emerge from the
charred cotton. The stars were on full display up above.
It was a good Fourth of July.
I spent most of the rest of the summer climbing, but I
did make it out for a grotto camp-out in Gifford Pin-
chot National Forest. We spent two days digging and
surveying in lava tubes and on Saturday night we ate
most of a pig that had been boiled in oil. Amy arrived in
Portland in October, about the same time as the winter
rains. We were witness to an unbroken thirty day stretch
of precipitation. The weather made caving an optimal
activity and the two of us helped with the survey of sev-
eral lava tubes. As a reward Edd and Blair took us on a
long sport trip through Dynamited. We saw most of the
cave and even got on rope a few times.
Edd and his wife Cindy invited Amy and I over for din-
ner on Thanksgiving. We were surprised since we had
not known them very long but we accepted immediate-
ly. It just goes to show that one can find the caver family
even outside the VPI Grotto. Dinner was wonderful
and I even managed to do a good job making the pump-
kin pies. After dinner we were channel surfing and
found Bill Nye the Science Guy doing his episode on
caves. Who could ask for more?
Amy and I hooked up with Edd and Cindy again for
New Year's Eve. Amy's birthday is the same day and so
we celebrated that first with a feast of crab legs at their
house. Then we all went out for drinking and dancing at
an old school that had been converted to a hotel and
party house. .
In December Amy got a job offer in Denver that she
could not refuse. We made the decision to move imme-
diately. We were both excited to see Colorado and we
are both extremely happy to be here now. Still I miss the
friends I made in my short time in Oregon. It is a good
thing Convention is only a few months away.
