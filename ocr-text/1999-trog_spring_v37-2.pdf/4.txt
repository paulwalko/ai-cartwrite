had been blasted open with dynamite. Surprisingly, the
cave gets its name from an earlier incident in which it
was blasted shut.
The duck-under took us to a long passage. Here I was
introduced to my favorite of all lava tube features: orig-
inal floor. The passages of lava tubes are, for the most
part, covered with breakdown. The ceilings of tubes are
formed of brittle and usually unstable rock. Over time
this rock falls to the floor. Unlike limestone where
blocks car-sized and larger often fall, lava tube break-
down tends to be small. Small means rocks generally
smaller than a motorcycle and mostly just bigger than a
bowling ball. Lava tube breakdown also tends to be
sharp and unstable. Limestone breakdown has much
softer edges and is more stable in comparison. Maybe
this is caused by redeposited calcite bonding the lime-
stone blocks together. Maybe it is the mud, which is al-
most absent in lava tubes. Whatever the reason I was
surprised at how every little block of breakdown in Dy-
namited wanted to turn my ankle. This is why I like orig-
inal floor.
Original floor means that you can walk directly on the
surface of the flow that cooled in the tube. There is no
breakdown piled on top of it. It is flat like the surface of
a liquid, which it used to be. Often you can find ripple
marks in original floor. This drives home the fact that
the rock you are standing on once flowed like a river.
Original floor is always a welcome break from picking
one's way through breakdown. Unfortunately it is also a
short break. Easy walking just means you get to the next
section of breakdown faster.
The other great aspect of original floor is that it has the
tube's original ceiling overhead. Tube ceilings look aw-
fully similar to tube floors in areas that have collapsed.
The original ceiling is often quite attractive. Usually it is
covered with remelt. Remelt occurs when previously
cooled rock on the ceiling is heated to the melting point
once again by the hot lava flowing beneath it. The rock
is left with a very smooth and shiny surface. Sometimes
the remelt sags and looks like a limestone soda straws
trying to form a first half-inch. In some cases the rock
forms dripsicles, lava stalactites. Occasionally remelt
holds formations that bear an uncanny resemblance to
helectites.
The passage we followed soon brought us to a down-
climb in a large room. From this room one can continue
in the same direction to the rest of the cave, or double
back beneath the passage that brought you in from the
entrance. To reach our destination we doubled back.
This took us into the Sandcastle Passage. Here the
breakdown gave way to a floor of volcanic sand. Water
dripping from the ceiling had created some beautiful
and delicate formations in this sand, which they call
sandcastles. As the water drips in the same spot over
and over it drills down into the sand. The displaced sand
is thrown up into towers, some twelve inches high, their
shapes determined by the surrounding drips. Sandcas-
tles are another type of formation that you will never see
in a limestone cave. In limestone every drop of water
would contain dissolved calcite which would be depos-
ited on the sand as the water was exposed to oxygen in
the air. All of the sand would become bonded together
and stalagmites would grow on top. Volcanic rock con-
tains no calcite or gypsum to dissolve and be redeposit-
ed. Flagging tape had been laid down to mark a trail
through the sandcastles and we followed it carefully.
The Sandcastle Passage ended at Blair and Edd's most
recent success. Back in February they had succeeded in
penetrating a breakdown choke there. Along with Bret
Cook and Garry Petrie, Blair's brother, they had skied
in to reach the cave and then camped in the Sandcastle
Passage. From there they were able to work the dig to
its conclusion. Bret was the lucky first person to wriggle
into the new 800 foot section. The section was later
named Walker Road after a friend who had passed
away. We gingerly worked our way through the dig to
Walker Road. There were still plenty of sizeable rocks in
precarious positions that one had to crawl past.
After 800 feet of breakdown hopping we arrived at the
new dig. It was located at the top of a breakdown pile
that rose thirty feet to meet an unstable ceiling. I looked
at that ceiling and then at the crowbars the others car-
ried. Were these people crazy? We scrambled up to the
top of the pile and I was shown the dig. It actually pro-
gressed horizontally from the top of the pile after a
short vertical tube. Here the walls and ceiling were com-
posed of small boulders suspended in sand. By gently
poking at the sand with a crowbar you could drop the
rocks into the crawl space. When enough material had
been poked loose you just pushed it behind you and
down the vertical tube. Another person at the bottom
would then pull this material out onto the breakdown
pile. Sometimes a large rock had to be removed from
the ceiling of the dig. If it looked dangerous the digger
would put a loop of webbing on it and retreat to the
bottom of the vertical tube. A tug on the webbing
would then bring the rock out of the ceiling. If you were
lucky it also came down the tube. That way you knew it
was not balanced on the edge above you as you came
back up the tube.
We took turns in the dig and pulling debris out into the
room. Mike fired up his stove to give us some hot choc-
olate. Blair and Edd started looking at other possibilities
at the top of the breakdown pile. Soon they were prying
large rocks out of the ceiling. I found that the loud
crashes made me nervous while I was in the original dig
working sand out from around a rock. Then I found an-
other rock in the ceiling that would require the webbing.
It was the biggest of these that I had seen. I carefully
looped the webbing over an end and retreated. As I slid
down the vertical tube I wondered if the big rock would
make it through there. It was roughly egg shaped so I
was certain it would roll into the vertical part. There was
nothing I could do to control the roll, though. At the
