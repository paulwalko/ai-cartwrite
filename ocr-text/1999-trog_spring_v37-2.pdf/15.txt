The Practice Rescue
by Jessica Dorr
On March 27, 1999, The VPI Cave Club sponsored a
simulated horizontal cave rescue in Tawney's Cave. We
brought together various rescue organizations from
Southwest Virginia. We had talked in the past about
sending out letters to get fellow cave rescuers out to our
annual spring practice rescue. Unfortunately it always
seemed that no one had the time to actually do the in-
viting. There was also talk of not knowing how benefi-
cial it would be having others along for our practice
rescue. It was supposed to be our time for learning and
others may just get in the way. Then there was always
the problem of past conflicts between rescue organiza-
tions.
We came to the realization at a safety committee meet-
ing in the fall of 1998 that it was time to attempt a prac-
tice rescue with all the rescue organizations we didn't
know too much about any more. The planning took
some work, sending out letters, doing follow up calls,
warning the Bat Ranch folks, etc. Luckily everyone was
helpful and the day came with only a few minor flaws.
Okay there was one real big one: "You mean Kirk's not
in the cave?"
