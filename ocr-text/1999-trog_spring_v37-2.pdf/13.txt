Way Back: Spence's Cave
by Robert Loney
June 8, 1951
I. The expedition consisted of R.M. Bottoms, Jeanette
Bottoms, R. M. Morgan, C. T. McDaniel, J. K. Clem-
ents, D. C. Counts, R. W. Loney, Adam Chow, Ed des
Rochers. They were all in one party because there was
only one place to go and one thing to do in the cave.
Earl Thierry, Larry Sabatinos, and Jean Lowry were also
on the expedition from the Wytheville Grotto.
II. The cave is located... about 150 feet up the side of a
hill and the entrance is a hole about 2 feet in diameter.
III. The equipment needed includes about 400 feet of
ladder and safety rope to go with it. If the party consists
of good climbers, 200 feet of rope could be substituted
for 200 feet of the ladder. Steel ladder is best because it
is hard to get the ladder up after it has been used and
steel ladder is the easiest to handle. The ladders can be
secured to rocks at the top of the drops. About 200 feet
is needed for the first drop. Telephones come in handy.
IV. The cave is comprised of a little room right below
the entrance which is about five feet above the floor of
the room. There is then about 50 feet of walking pas-
sage consisting of dry and wet rock. At the end of the
50 feet there is a hole that is the top of a 200 foot drop.
Halfway down the drop or about 174 of the way is what
it really is, there is a jumping off place that is a room
which is very beautiful.
It consists of crystalline formations that are twisted into
all sorts of shape and sizes. There are also many pure
white stalagmites and flowstone. At the bottom of the
drop it is very muddy and wet. There is a passage going
two ways from the bottom of the ladder. One way goes
into another beautiful room that consists of many crys-
talline structures and a stalagmite that is about 15 feet
high and only about 4 inches in diameter throughout its
whole length. The other way the passage goes about a
very muddy 15 feet, goes up about five feet, makes a
right turn, goes down about 8 feet, goes along about 15
feet, then down about 20 feet which can be climbed
fairly easily, then the passage becomes rocky and starts
a slanting down walking passage, this passage continues
for about 40 feet and ends in another drop. This drop is
a series of small ledges an average of 20 feet apart. A
good climber can go from ledge to ledge on a rope be-
cause the passage is only about three feet wide on the
average. This drop is about 180 feet deep and ends in a
stream that goes into the wall. It is not worth the trouble
to climb down it. The cave is really just a slit in the
ground about 400 feet from top to bottom and not over
15 feet wide.
V. The expedition left from the parking lot beside the
M. C. Lab about 7:45 a.m. Sunday. We were supposed
to meet the Wytheville Grotto in Wytheville at 8:00 a.m.
and leave here about 6:00 a.m., but as usual we were late.
We left Wytheville about 9:00 a.m. and got to the cave
within two hours. We all got in the entrance and af
we rigged the ladders, Earl Thieery went down, then
Bob Loney went down with a telephone, the Jack Clem-
ents came down. Three or four more came down, but
some stayed at the top the whole time. Earl and Bob
went exploring the longest passage and came to the sec-
ond drop. Earl went down on a rope and was saftied by
Bob. This took quite a bit of time because it is hard to
climb down and up 200 feet. Some others had been ex-
ploring the jumping off place and the room at the bot-
tom of the cave and after Earl and Bob got back, it was
time to start out. This took a very great length of time
because about eight people had to climb up 200 feet of
rope and a little trouble was had getting the people off
the jumping off place because they had to climb with
the aid of a safety on the face of an almost perpendicu-
lar wall about 15 feet to where the ladder was. Every-
body's efficiency was lowered because it was cold sitting
around waiting for people to climb here and there. Get-
ting the ladders up took more time than anything be-
cause they kept getting stuck and were heavy with mud.
By the time everybody was out is was about midnight.
We stopped to eat a little food that was brought along,
then left and got back to Blacksburg early Monday
morning. Special mention should be made of Ray Roll-
ston because we got him up at 6:00 a.m. Sunday morn-
ing to drive because we didn't have enough cars and he
got back much later than he wanted to.
Way Back is a series of articles pulled from the club archives. The idea and this submission came from Lawrence
Britt, keeper of the club files.
