COMMENTS
I was utterly amazed at how well we all worked together
and how fast we got the patient to the surface. I would
personally like to thank everyone who participated and
encourage others to participate in the future. Thank you
Southwest Virginia Mountain Rescue Group, Triangle
Rescue, Blue Ridge Grotto, New River Valley Grotto,
Girl Scouts of America, and VPI Cave Club for partici-
pating and setting a precedent for future practice res-
cues.

cave rescues, so some of the terms may have been used
