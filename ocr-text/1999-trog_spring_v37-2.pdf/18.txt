Before the club could close
down for the summer, one
more member was voted in.
Eileen O'Malley finished her
requirements the day of Picnic
and joined the dark side at the
meeting that night. It seems
her membership was a shoo-
in once word got out that she
enjoyed naked caving. The
overwhelming reaction at the
fire? “It's about damn time!"
PICNIC
Well, you already read about
the interesting weather condi-
tions for Picnic this year. The
food and beer were well re-
What? Eileen at El Rotono ceived, especially the Wood-
before getting membership?! chuck cider. Ray made a batch
of his wonderful chili, and
folks brought side salads and other goodies. Jerry and
Joan Redder brought out a carrot cake Sunday morning
in celebration of Joan's upcoming birthday. (Don't wor-
fy, the dog only squashed a few icing flowers.)
The biking crowd seems to grow every year. This year
the Elvis Grotto rode out in force. They must be sloppy
eaters, because each one arrived sporting a napkin
around their necks.
Bad weather always makes for a good fire, and this year
was no exception. The wind made for an interesting
spark shower now and again, and the cold air added the
usual element of “can't get too close, can't get too far.”
PRACTICE RESCUE, THEN THE REAL THING
The club participated in its yearly practice rescue in late
March at Tawney's. This time several other groups were
invited to join in and share their knowledge. Check out
Jessica Dorr's article in this very issue!) which offers
play-by-play coverage. Luckily Kirk Digby's injuries
proved non-fatal and the group brought him safely to
the Bat Ranch. (Have you ever seen a highline rigged in
Tawney's?) After the rescue, while munching on snacks
provided by Carol and Joe Zokaites, those with actual
rescue experience critiqued the event. The final verdict?
Not bad for a buncha amateurs. Talk continued that
night at a birthday party for Steve LePera held in the
abode of the Basement Boys (Steve Wells' lower half).
Just weeks later, members and trainees alike were awak-
ened at 2:00 a.m. by Zenah Orndorff, slave driver of the
rescue roster. The following summary comes largely
from a post to the club listserv by a somewhat sleepy Al-
lison Barth (who assisted at the entrance).
A group from Concord College went caving in New
River Cave. They split into two groups at the China
slide, but Charles got separated from the groups. Each
group thought he was with the other group. The two
groups met at the entrance at midnight and discovered
that Charles wasn't with them. They went back to the
cave and searched for awhile, but were too tired to con-
tinue. One of them knew Mike Newsome, so he headed
to the Bat Ranch for help.
The first crew of six VPI cavers went into the cave at
2:00 a.m. to search. Several other groups were sent into
the cave throughout the night and field phones were
strung from the entrance to the Lunchroom. Charles
was found around 6:00 a.m. way downstream from the
China Slide. He was cold and miserable but otherwise
fine, and he caved out with a group of three VPI cavers.
Wil Orndorff took charge at the cave entrance. He used
a cell phone initially to communicate with Zenah, but
reception was spotty. The hams were called in and com-
munication resumed with Philip Balister at the cave en-
trance, Phil Benchoff at the road at the base of the
mountain, and Eileen O'Malley at the Orndorff house.
Overall about 20 to 25 VPI cavers showed up and six or
seven people from Concord who were not on the orig-
inal trip.
Shortly after 7:00 a.m. the lost soul from Concord was
out of the cave and the last of the search crews appeared
at the entrance. The field phones were retrieved and the
weary rescuers headed home, some to work, some to
class, some to bed.
YTR
Sixty-some cavers came to Young Timer's this year,
again at the WVAC's field house in West Virginia. Stu-
dent grotto cavers abandoned camp on Saturday to
swarm into nearby caves. Saturday evening was spent at
the fire discussing the day's trips and planning for next
year. As hoped, the event is gaining popularity
Trainee Doug Cole got more than he bargained for: in-
stead of conning the cute chick from the fire into his
tent, he ended up getting yuked on. (Stick with the club
awhile, Doug. You'll get the hang of it.)
Before heading home on Sunday, a group of VPI cavers
led by Conservation Chair Joey Fagan stopped at Isl
Ford Cave for a clean-up trip (thanks a lot, Sandy K.).
Turns out a group had cleaned the cave the prior week-
end, so there were only a few bags of trash to haul out.
Sandy Knapp, Steve LePera, Steve Wells, Matt Burnett,
Chris "Guido” Garguilo, and Ray Sira did manage to
clean some graffiti from the walls. Kirk Digby opted to
sit outside the cave in protest of the cleanup. Reports
indicate that the highlight of the trip was watching
Guido slosh through the quicksand in search of the
deepest spot.
ROPE RUNNING
Once again the Orndorff clan opened their front yard as
a site for rope training/racing practice. Bring your gear
and your energy. Sessions start at 5:00ish on Wednesday
evenings, but keep your ears open – the night may
change. There's no excuse for not running rope at OTR
this summer. Says Wil, “I bet T.J. and Naomi can beat
all of you slackers on a frog system.”
