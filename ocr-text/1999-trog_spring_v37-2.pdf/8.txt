And the Mud Said "Glop"
by Andrew Oberhardt
.
Ever since I'd started caving with the club I'd heard of
the cave called Pig Hole, and it always had allure to me.
I could never place exactly why I always wanted to go
there, but I think it had something to do with the 120-
foot entrance pit that doesn't require climbing back out.
There is also the human desire to do things that are for-
bidden. Because of a death a number of years ago the
cave is closed to all but experienced vertical cavers. That
phrase can be interpreted many ways, but in this grotto
it usually means that you have to have gone on a vertical
trip with the club before and climbed rope.
After a few vertical trips I was ready for Pig Hole, but
there is one more regulation we had to follow – be out
by sundown. In order to do that and still get a good day
of caving we met at Smythe at 9AM, an ungodly hour in
my opinion especially for a Saturday morning. Along on
the trip were John Deighan, Chris Garguilo, and Beth
Geiger. We surprisingly didn't waste too much time,
and were at the cave shortly.
I rigged the entrance with John's supervision so I could
get some good rigging practice. After everyone inspect-
ed the rig, John made the first descent. A few minutes
later we heard “off rope!” and I threaded my figure-8,
made my calls, and started my rappel. This was the big-
gest rappel I'd ever done and it was pretty exciting. I
stopped halfway down to admire the view. The entrance
of Pig Hole is beautiful except for the tires at the bot-
tom.
When we all got to the bottom John decided to show us
the Empire Ledge and then do the “glop” walk, then see
if we had time to do the 90-foot pit by the Mud Bridge.
We climbed up a few rocks and made a right turn, leav-
ing the second rope there so we won't have to drag it
through the glop walk. After a few small crawls and a
straddle pit or two we emerged in a room with a ledge
revealing nothing but darkness. John told us that this
was the Empire Ledge. It's 180 feet down to the cave
floor; the Mud Bridge is halfway down somewhere. I'll
take his word for it. We didn't go near the edge, but we
did get an appreciation of the vastness of the pit by lis-
tening to the echo of our voices in the room.
Next stop was the "glop” walk. On the way there I was
wondering why it's called that but my curiosity was
soon satisfied. The mud at the beginning of the walk has
the illusion of being avoidable. As it turns out you may
be able to stay above of it and chimney for awhile, but
eventually you'll need to step in it... “Glop” says the
mud. Accompanied with the sound is the sinking feeling
and then the "I've got your boots” game. Once through
the mud we emerged in the middle of what appeared to
be a large breakdown pile. John informed us that this
area is very mazy and he always gets lost there; Chris
didn't know this part of the cave at all. Chris and Beth
sat down, still a little tired from the previous nights spe-
leo seminar, while John and I tried to find the correct
hole to crawl through. After awhile I gave up and joined
Beth and Chris. Finally John found the correct path and
we followed.
Through the crawl we heard John yell back “That
sucked! Next person come on through.” John is the
kind of person who never complains about anything so
I knew it was a bad sign. As I was next I pushed my pack
ahead and crawled on through the mud. The crawl was
short but sticky, and by the time I got to the other side
I was covered in mud. I carefully emerged on the other
side, aided by some helpful comments from John, at the
top of a fairly large downclimb. It's a little disconcerting
when you come out of a crawl and can't even stand up
before being exposed on the side of a small cliff. I
wasn't sure if the mud on my clothes made it harder or
easier, but I managed my way down after a little bit of
deliberation and some harsh words.
As Chris was doing the last leg of the downclimb he
demonstrated to us trainees one of the things not to do
in a cave. He tossed his pack the last few feet to the
ground before finishing the descent. Instead of staying
where it landed, his pack rolled a little... then a lot and
ended up rolling down a slope out of view. Luckily there
wasn't a pit there and the pack was located and retrieved
fairly quickly.
The next place we went was the Queen's Bath, which is
a majestic pool of crystal clear water surrounded by nu-
merous formations ranging from rimstone dams to sta-
lagmites and soda straws. After the Queen's Bath we
went through the crawl back to the previous room and
started to look for the passage towards the Mud Bridge.
We looked for over an hour when finally Chris remem-
bered that it was a turnoff from the crawl to the
Queen's Bath and we'd gone too far. By the time we lo-
cated the Mud Bridge we'd wasted so much time that it
was after 4 o'clock and the sun would be setting in just
over an hour.
Chris and I went to retrieve the rope we had left earlier,
and then we all headed toward the culvert that is the
cave's other entrance. That was an interesting experi-
ence too since the pipe is just the right width that makes
it almost impossible to climb. Instead I had to stick my
arms up above my head and stand on the rocks around
the pipe until I could reach the ground above and pull
myself out. After derigging the entrance pit and chang-
ing we were off the property just before sundown and
on our way to El Rodeo for dinner.
