two ropes at the pit, the first being a 1500' rope and the
second being two 600' ropes tied together. We all rap-
pelled the long rope to avoid passing the knot on the
way down and the more experienced half of the group
would climb the rope with the knot in the middle. I had
switched my ropewalker from using Petzl ascenders to
Gibbs thinking I might avoid the problems of my bun-
gee cord being eaten by the knee ascender and the fact
that they just seemed more secure. I've noticed the big
ger the pit the more paranoid people seem to get. I was
climbing tandem on top when I reached the knot and
started to pass it. I had failed to consider the difficulties
of getting my foot Gibbs past the knot with the weight
of someone below me. After struggling for a few min-
utes to get the pin out it finally came loose along with
the little string that held it to the shell and it proceeded
to fall 500 some odd feet never to be seen again. ROCK!
When climbing I
always recom-
mend carrying one
more ascender
than your system
requires, even if it
is only a prussic
knot. In this case
climbing another
500' with one foot,
although not dan-
gerous, would have
been very annoy-
ing. I ended up re-
placing the foot

and climbed the
rest of the way out with my Petzl handle jammer for my
safety. I could just as easily have used the handle jam-
mer on my foot and climbed with a prussic safety. Learn
to improvise. Practice what you would do if any part of
your system should fail. If an ascender were to fail on a
frog system it would be difficult to climb with only one
remaining ascender. You should also be certain that ev-
erything you are carrying is securely attached so it won't
fall. I recall one incident where a caver at the top of a pit
dropped a jacket he had taken off before starting his
climb. From the bottom it looked like a caver in free
fall.
A broken bungee cord on a double bungee rope walker
is something that has happened to me a couple of times
and can leave the system very difficult to use. Although
I often carry a spare bungee cord in my cave gear it nev-
er seems to be around when you need it. What I did was
to tie the broken bungee cord short and attach it only to
the foot ascender. I then added a short cord or carabiner
to the knee ascender and pulled it up as in a Mitchell sys-
tem.
On a recent trip to Ellison's cave in Georgia it wasn't
until I was getting ready to climb out of Fantastic Pit
that I realized I was missing one of the foot stirrups for
my ropewalker. I had the ascender but no way of attach-
ing it to my foot. With a four foot length of webbing I
was able to fashion one by looping around the foot,
crossing at the top, looping around the ankle and tying
it off with a water knot. The resulting stirrup is impos-
sible to remove without untying it and may need to be
cut off. For this reason I attached the ascender with a
carabiner so it could be removed without untying the
webbing. I found that even on a long climb it was no
more uncomfortable than the sewn one I had on my
other foot.
With the increased availability of off-the-shelf climbing
systems, many new cavers aren't learning the fine art of
how to put one together yourself out of a few simple
items. It may not be the most efficient or comfortable
but it will get you out of the cave in a pinch. A 25'length
of webbing carried in your pack can be used in any
number of ways from a handline to a seat or chest har-
ness. Again practice how you would repair your climb-
ing system if any part of it were to break or turn up
missing
A caver I know once told me about a trip where he was
climbing rope and got to a point were the sheath of the
rope had been abraded away and most of the core with
it. It hadn't been padded properly by the climber before
him. There was a rebelay below him which prevented
him from tying the two ends together and another caver
waiting to climb. A replacement rope was not readily
available. So, how do you get the second caver up the
drop safely? He took his safety ascender and attached it
to the rope upside down and below the bad spot thus
transferring the weight of the next climber to him. The
caver at the bottom then climbed up to the first cayer,
passed him and continued to the top. The first caver
then followed.
With more caving than ever before happening in re-
mote places, self rescue is often the only option a caver
has. There is a lot of work currently being done on self
rescue techniques. I've seen demonstrations of modi-
fied climbing systems that allow a climber to more easily
ascend a rope with a second person attached to him and
rappel a rope while someone is hanging on it below you.
There was a time when cavers felt the best way to get
down a rope was with a body rappel and wouldn't be
caught dead using this new fancy nylon stuff. There are
a lot of new ideas out there and you shouldn't close your
eyes to them because it's not the way we used to do it.‚Äù
Anyone who does vertical caving long enough is even-
tually going to either climb or rappel a rope only to find
they left something at the bottom or top of the drop.
I've seen people forget all kinds of things including
packs, helmets and even other cavers. But what do you
do when you get to the bottom of a drop only to find
you don't have anything to climb out with? It seems im-
possible but check the NSS accident reports. It happens
