ing on his/her own, is he/she conscious, are there any
major bleeds, does he/she seem disorientated, what is
the patients major complaint? All of this is ever perti-
nent to the rescuers. As the person who stays on scene,
you need to monitor the patient and be able to describe
any changes to the rescuers. You also need to stabilize
the patient's head with your hands. The patient should
not be able to move it from side to side; this is to avoid
any further head or neck injury. Control any major
bleeds with either direct pressure or a compression
wrap type bandage made of duck tape or what you have
available. Avoid a tourniquet at all costs. It should
be a last resort only. 99.9% of the time it will cause
the loss of everything below it! Monitor the patient's
A,B,C's: make sure they have an open Airway, a means
to breath; make sure they are indeed Breathing; Circu-
lation, make sure they have a pulse and it seems to be a
normal speed and a normal rhythm. If they have no
A,B,C's start CPR. If you don't know CPR it is a class I
think all people should take. Another thing to watch for
is shock. What to look for in shock: pale cool skin, weak
pulse in the wrist, disorientation, etc. If the signs are
present, elevate the patient's feet and hope rescue is
close!
In the case of a compound fracture, one where the bone
protrudes from the skin, Do not attempt to set the
bone! If there is bleeding, control it by direct pressure
or by a compression wrap. Splint the bone as is and/or
wait for a rescue. Monitor the blood supply and the pa-
tient's over all pain.
Well, I think I better stop this before it turns into a
book. I realize that it is long and not tons of fun to read,
but if you have an interest in Emergency Medicine I en-
courage you to take an EMT class: get involved. I love
EMS with a passion, and I love to talk about it, so if
there are questions about this article or if reading it
brings up topics not covered, please ask. There are plen-
ty of things not covered here and plenty more to know.
Even though I know you most likely will not retain ev-
erything I covered here, if you retain any you're just that
much more ahead of the game. Have fun and cave safe!
