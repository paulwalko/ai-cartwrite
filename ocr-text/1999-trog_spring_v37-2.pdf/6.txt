After reading through the membership requirements, it
occurred to me that I had to submit something to the
Trog myself. Well, I have had many interesting cave
trips with the club, and I could tell you all about the wit-
ty comments made and how we had made fun of each
other in the cave, but I have decided to tackle a much
bigger project: Caving First Aid. Now before I jump
right in to this, a little about myself. I am an EMT and
have a fair amount of field experience above ground. I
realize that not of all the techniques I mention can work
in all situations, so use them more as a guideline. Also
keep in mind that this is my opinion on how to handle
medical emergencies in a cave. In most cases there are
many ways to treat an injury; these are the way that I feel
are most appropriate.
BUMPS BRUISES AND CUTS
Perhaps the most common injuries in caves. There is re-
ally little that can be done for these provided that they
are minor. Your goal here is to keep a cut inside a cave
as clean as possible. Assuming that most caves drain a
farmers field in some form or another there is usually a
high amount of biomass in a cave. This is not the sort
of thing you want to expose an open wound to if possi-
ble. Be resourceful; use some drinking water to clean it
and some duck tape as a makeshift bandage until you
can get home and treat it.
SPRAINS AND STRAINS
This is the type of injury that you want to treat right
away, and this also should bring the end to your cave
trip. Treat a sprain or strain with RICE.
Rest. Get off you feet, sit down and take a break.
Immobilize. Try to stabilize you ankle. Ideally you don't
want any movement in you foot at all. In a cave setting,
you do not want to remove your boot if it can be avoid-
ed. Your boot will act as a cast of sorts. Again, think
about what you have available to you to keep that foot
from moving. Duck tape and a rack can make an excel
lent splint.
Compression/Cold. Don't remove your boot; it helps
keep pressure on the injury which helps keep swelling
down. Apply cold when possible. If there is a nearby
stream soak a shirt or some cloth in it and apply it to the
injury to keep the swelling down. Caution! Do not get
cold doing this; hypothermia is not your friend!!
Elevation. Lift the injury, prop it up on a rock or under
your pack. This will help with the swelling and pain.
When the pain eases or you feel ready to exit the cave
. ready to exit the cave
take your time. Caving is hard on you body. Ask for
ving is hard on you body. Ask for
help when you need it and take breaks on the way out.
Remember that if it is causing you great pain when you
move, it could be broken. So if you can feel you can't
make it out on your own, don't try.
HYPOTHERMIA
Be careful, this is a silent killer. Unfortunately the syr
ymp-
toms of hypothermia are also the byproducts of hard
caving. Lethargy, drowsiness, disorientation (if you get
lost a lot). Your friends are you best defense against hy-
pothermia. Keep you eye on a person who stops shiver-
ing while they are still cold or have done little to get
warmer. If you suspect that you have a cold exposure
actively re-warm the patient. Make a heat tent with your
trash bag that should be in you helmet and a carbide
light or candle. Monitor the patient's skin. If the skin
temperature does not improve, get moving! It is time to
get that person out of the cave and to medical attention.
Use your best judgement on a cave trip while you still
have it. If you start to get really cold, get out of the cave!
OH SHIT TYPE INJURIES
This is the last thing any of us want to face under-
ground, possibly hours away from help. These injuries
range from serious to very, very serious. Let's start with
a single broken bone. If it's a finger use duck tape, but
be smart about it. Wrap something around you finger
like cloth or wrap the first loop of tape with the stick
side outward so it's not so hard to get off when the time
comes. A broken arm without a protruding bone can be
splinted with a rack and duck tape or whatever is avail-
able. Monitor the blood supply below the break. Make
sure the skin below the break is not pale; push on the
nail beds of the fingers and look to see how long it takes
for color to return. It should take a maximum of 3 sec-
onds for the nail bed to return to normal. If the skin
and nail beds indicate there is little to no blood supply
in the arm reposition the splint. Lack of blood to the
area below the break can cause permanent cell death,
which may cause loss of the area below the break. Use
the same splinting procedures for broken lower legs be-
ing sure to monitor the blood supply.
Falls are another big problem you may encounter; they
may even be the cause of the broken bones mentioned
above. Any fall can cause permanent and serious injury,
but for the sake of argument let's consider any fall over
10 feet a serious fall. The most serious fall is going to be
one where the head, neck, or back impacts before the
rest of the body. In my opinion a fall of this nature is a
serious problem and for the safety of the patient will
merit a rescue 100% of the time, no questions asked.
Your number 1 priority as an able bodied person is to
get to the patient and see what is going on. Decide who
is going out to get help. The person who takes on this
responsibility should be able to tell the rescue team
what is going on with the patient. Is the patient breath-
