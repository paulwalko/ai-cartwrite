bottom of the shaft I found that the webbing was a bit
too short. For some reason, though, it was the only
piece we had with us. I reached back into the tube and
yanked hard, retreating as I heard the rock move. There
was a rush of sand and then nothing. I crawled in and
peered up the tube. The two ends of the rock were
caught on the walls. I could see no easy way to free it.
Edd volunteered to have a look at the rock and soon he
was in the small vertical tube. We saw only his legs be-
low the knee as he wrestled with it. Suddenly Edd was
seated in the crawlway with the rock in his lap. "Help! I
can't breathe!‚Äù he gasped. There was genuine panic in
his voice. Mike and Blair were closest and dove into the
crawlway. Somehow they managed to lift the rock off of
Edd in the tight quarters. The experience reminded us
just how careful we had to be. We all moved rock for
another hour or so, Edd included. Finally our enthusi-
asm ran out. The airflow in the dig was still tempting,
but it was obvious that several more trips would be
needed to follow it.
As we made our way back through Walker road I re-
flected on the volume of material we had shifted. I had
never seen so much rock moved in a dig. Was it ethical
to do such a thing in a caye? Such care was taken to pre-
serve the sandcastles from careless feet, and yet we had
just moved hundreds of pounds of rock and sand in an-
other section of the same passage. The only difference
was that we were pursuing airflow when we moved the
rock. I finally decided that it was not all that different
from digging in limestone. Cavers will move yard after
cubic yard of mud pursuing air in limestone. The nature
of the cave was what determined the digging method in
Dynamited. In either case one has to reconcile the de-
sire for virgin passage with the fact that the cave is being
altered.
Maybe I was considering such questions of ethics. Or
maybe I was wondering if we would stop for beer on the
drive home. Either way I should have been paying more
attention as we made our way back through the first dig.
I thought that the area below me was clear. Even so, I
was being careful. I bumped one of the rocks near me
though and it dropped onto Edd below me. It caught
him square on the front of the helmet. As a result the
rim of the helmet came down and hit the bridge of his
nose. When I got out of the dig I found him tending to
a good split in the skin of his nose. He was well pre-
pared to deal with it, though. Edd carries the most ex-
tensive first aid kit I have seen underground, rescues
excepted. We all made jokes about the cave being out to
get him, but I had to wonder what kind of impression I
was going to leave on these guys.
Back in the entrance room we scrambled up a climb to
look at another little passage and then it was time to go.
As we slogged back to the car we talked about plans for
more caving. Edd and Blair said that I would have to see
the rest of Dynamited. It is one of the few lava tubes in
the region that has any drops that require ropes. All in
all it was a good first trip with members of the WVG
and I looked forward to more caving with them.
