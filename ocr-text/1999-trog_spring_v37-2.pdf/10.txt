Now What Do I Do?

I've been climbing ropes in one way or another for over
25 years, and I've learned no matter how well prepared
and trained you are eventually something is going to go
wrong. Learning what to do when it happens can help
make the difference between a slight inconvenience and
a major rescue or worse. I've had my share of close calls
and have heard a lot of stories from my fellow cavers.
Hopefully reading about our close calls and how we got
out of them will help you get out of a jam someday.
One of the first times I ever rappelled was at an old ce-
ment railroad bridge in New Jersey. There was a 60°
drop and a 120' drop. At the time it was still being used
and every once in a while a train would come by and the
whole bridge would shake. I was on the short drop
about 15 feet off the ground when I became distracted
by an oncoming train and my hair got sucked into the
rack I was using. Being a training session, we had two
ropes rigged and my dad was able to climb up and get
me out.
This is probably the most common type of incident
while doing vertical work that I know of, whether it's
hair, gloves, shirts or whatever. But how could I have
gotten myself out of this situation? To begin with we
should look at how it could have been prevented in the
first place. Part of the problem I had was the harness I
was wearing. It allowed the rack to ride too high to the
point where it was sitting in front of my face. A properly
fitted harness would have kept the rack lower and away
from my hair. Also if you have long hair keep it tied
back and out of the way. A fast reacting bottom belay
can be very helpful if you find yourself in this kind of
situation.
What if I was the first person down the drop and this
happened? The first thing you need to do is stop your
decent. Having something jammed into your rack or
figure 8 can do this very effectively and painfully. If you
are not completely stopped you are going to want to do
this by keeping tension on the rope below your rappel
device. Wrapping the rope several times around your leg
or around your foot and standing in it can do this and
will leave both hands free. If you can, tie a loop in the
rope and stand in that. Most likely you will need to re-
move your rappel device from the rope. To do this you
will need to attach an ascender to the rope above your
rappelling device and shift your weight onto it. You
then remove your descender, unjam it and reattach it to
the rope. If all you have are knots or your ascenders are
in your pack you are going to have big problems. You
should always rappel with a safety ascender attached to
your seat harness and it should be able to be attached to
the rope with one hand. Using a knife to cut yourself
out should only be done as a last resort. A rope under
tension can be severed with very little effort. If you are
going to be the first person down a rope consider wear-
ing your full climbing system. I've seen a lot of people
doing this in Mexico and other deep pits but then they
seem to forget about it on the shorter drops back home.
While at the TAG convention back in 1989 a group of
us were going to drop two pits that were within walking
distance of each other. One needed a slightly longer
rope than the other. We split into two groups, each with
a rope, and headed off to rig the pits. We would then
switch pits when we were done. The pit I was helping to
rig had about a 50' drop to a large ledge where a stream
entered and flowed over the edge of the next part of the
drop, about another 50'. The rope was redirected to a
bolt at the top of this drop just to the side of the water-
fall, however the water was hitting the wall halfway
down and being deflected right into the path of the
rope. The water flow wasn't excessive and the drop was
short so we went ahead and rigged. Three of us looked
at the drop and said "I think the rope reaches?” So we
tied a knot in the bottom of the rope and I went down
first. Not being sure if the rope reached, I put my full
climbing system on before I rappelled. I rappelled down
to where I would have to start getting wet and it looked
like the rope was just touching the floor. So I jumped in
and did a quick rappel to the bottom so as to stay as dry
as possible. At about 10 to 15 feet off the floor I realized
the rope was a little too short and there I was, left hang-
ing in a waterfall. It would seem that we had rigged with
the wrong rope. I managed to swing myself over to the
side, where I caught hold of a very narrow ledge which
I could balance on and stay out of the full force of the
water. I was using a Gibbs ropewalker at the time, so
there I was balancing on one foot in a waterfall trying to
get the damn Gibbs pin in the hole. Did I mention I was
using carbide and my electric lights were buried in my
pack? I got myself back up the rope and even kept my
carbide lamp lit during the whole process.
Most of us have practiced changeovers in trees and
such. However in an emergency being able to do it
quickly and effectively can mean the difference between
life and death. Hypothermia can set in very fast when
you're hanging in a waterfall and a number of cavers
have died this way. Just recently a caver in TAG died
while on rope when he could not perform a changeover
and became hypothermic. Be familiar with your vertical
system. Know how everything works and how it goes
on. Practice your changeovers until it becomes second
nature and next time your practicing try doing it blind-
folded. When you're in a wet pit be sure to have an elec-
tric light handy. Most carbide cavers I know also have a
small helmet mounted electric light.
A few years ago on my second trip to Golondrinas in
Mexico we had a fairly large group and decided to rig
