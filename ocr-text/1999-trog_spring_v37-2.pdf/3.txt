Nine Months with the Willamete Valley Grotto, Part I
by Carl Bern
The meeting was going to start late. The NSS Member's
Manual had said 7:30 PM and it was now fifteen min-
utes after that. I had to smile, thinking that I had already
found something that the cavers in Portland, Oregon
had in common with the VPI Grotto. As I waited, I
chatted with the other cavers wandering into the meet-
ing room at the Recreation Center. I was easily identi-
fied as a newcomer in this small group. People were
asking me how much caving I had done and I was trying
to figure out what kind of caving the Willamete Valley
Grotto did.
The president, Tom Kline, finally called the meeting to
order. There were no more than twenty people in the
room, a far cry from the crowd of cavers and cave
groupies that fill Smythe 146 on Friday evenings during
the academic year. Early in the meeting I was asked to
introduce myself and took the opportunity to mention
that I was interested in getting on a trip. As soon as I
stopped talking two guys across the table eagerly asked
me if I wanted to go on a Dynamited dig trip. "You're
digging with dynamite?” I had to ask. Actually Dynamit-
ed was the name of the cave, but they promised it would
be plenty interesting anyway. They were going the fol-
lowing weekend and I agreed to join them. I tried to
find a trip going out that weekend but had no luck. It
seems that the roads going to the caves were still cov-
ered with snow even though it was May. That is pretty
standard for high country in Oregon.
The grotto was planning activities for the coming sum-
mer and that was when I noticed something else the
WVG has in common with VPI. When it comes time to
assign responsibilities there is little eye contact and a lot
of silence, except when people are trying to coerce the
person next to them into volunteering. Being new, I was
able to sit back with a clear conscience. As the meeting
wrapped up I discovered what might be a key difference
with the WVG. They go to the bar after the meeting. It
was over pitchers at Godfather's Pizza that I learned
that it was Edd Kuedell and Blair Petrie that were taking
me digging in Dynamited Cave. They regaled me with
stories of success that they had with digs in this cave al-
ready. The passage we would be digging in was an 800
foot section called Walker Road. They had dug it open
only a few months previously. Altogether, Edd and
Blair had dug into about 1600 feet of virgin passage in
Dynamited. That got my attention and soon I was feel-
ing optimistic about the trip.
All too soon I noticed that the other cavers were paying
up and heading out. I found myself making sure that all
the pitchers were empty before I left. It was only 10:30
on a Friday night and I was headed home for the
evening. Three time zones east of me I was sure that
someone in the VPI grotto was rummaging in the fridge
for another beer.
Edd, Blair, and a third guy named Mike picked me up at
my new apartment the following weekend. As I loaded
my gear into Blair's minivan I had to ask, “Why is the
shovel wearing underwear?” There was a garden spade
in the back of the yan and it had a pair of long john bot-
toms slipped over the blade. They keep the van from
getting dirty, explained Blair. We drove east from Port-
land through the famous Columbia River Gorge and
then crossed the Columbia and went into Washington.
After an hour and a half we reached the town of Trout
Lake. From there headed into Gifford Pinchot National
Forest. On subsequent trips I saw the incredible mass of
Mount Adams from this route, but it was hidden that
day. As we drove into the National Forest Edd and Blair
marveled at how much the snow had melted since they
were last there. Occasional patches still crept onto the
road from the sides, but Blair steered around them. Fi-
nally we came to the point where the road was fully cov-
ered with snow. There were tire tracks in the snow
continuing up the road. Naturally we pressured Blair to
keep going, and after a short debate he did. We made
forty feet of progress and the minivan came to a halt.
We all piled out to discover snow packed into the un-
dercarriage. It was solid enough to keep the tires off the
road. The shovel was stripped of its underwear and put
to use. A couple of large crowbars were also used to
loosen snow from the undercarriage and for some rea-
son this seemed to make Blair nervous. After digging,
shoving branches under the tires, and pushing we got
the van back to bare pavement.
Soon we were changed and ready to go caving. As we
walked away from the minivan, I noticed that no one
was carrying the shovel. When I asked about this they
told me that we would not need it. Instead each of them
carried one of the big long crowbars. This was going to
be an interesting dig.
The entrance to Dynamited is in the side of a big de-
pression in the ground measuring maybe fifty feet
across. They called this the sink, and indeed it looked a
lot like a karst sinkhole. The major differences were the
lack of dirt and the large dark blocks of volcanic rock
that filled the sink. It was chilly outside so we did not
waste any time heading into the cave. Inside the cave I
found that the black lava swallowed up my electric light
just as it had in Ape Cave, my first lava tube. The other
three were electric cayers and being a guest I had decid-
ed to leave my carbide behind. As the saying goes,
"When caving in Rome, do as the Roman cavers do.”
My eyes adjusted to the darkness and I found myself in
a down-sloping room about 20 feet high. This led to a
duck-under covered with old concrete and sprouting
twisted rebar. It was the remains of an old cave gate that
