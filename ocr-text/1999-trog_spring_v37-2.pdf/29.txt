Day I Dec 27 Hike to Del Barro
I
WITH FART BOY OUT OF
THE WAY, FART MAN
HAD TO RELY ON HIS
FLATULANCE SOLEY
WITH WHICH TO WAGE
T HIS BATTLES,
HIS NEXT CHALLENGER
THE BEAST PASSED
MORE GAS THAN
FARTMAN HAD EVER
BARED WITNESS TO...
THE BPOWERS OF
FUMPI WERE CRUMBLING.
COULD TIH IS BE THE END
OF FARTMAN?? FARTMAN
HAD. ONLY ONE CHOICE.
I AM THE
AIR MAIDEN
EILEEN!
HE KNEW HE COULD NOT win
THIS BATTLE, BUT HE HAD NO WAY TO
GET AWAY FROM THE ANIMAL. WEAK AND
GROGGY OUR HERO WAS FOUND AND RESCUED
BY A FAIR MAIDEN NAMED EILEEN, WHO
HELPED THE POOR WEARY SUPER HERO
UP TO THE
PIT OF
FUMPI.
LITTLE DID OUR
HERO KNOW THAT
HIS MOST DEADLY
CHALLENGE WAS
SOON TO COME.
