Grotto Grapevine
by A.I. Cartwright
BANQUET
Banquet seems to bring out the best and later, worst) in
cavers. This year was no exception. Cheryl Jones gave
an interesting talk about her caving days in exotic lands
with Don Davison, complete with photos and audience
hecklers. (Jean Cobb held back from telling the tree sto-
ry, but ask her about it.)
The party continued into the wee hours, though it
seems not as many people as usual took to the dance
floor. Once again, rooms were set aside in the Newport
Rec Center for those opting to stay the night.
The awards ceremony, hosted by the club thespian
Dave Colatosti, began by presenting certificates of ap-
preciation to the landowners: the Sizer family, owners
of Newcastle Murder Hole; Mike Newsome and the Bat
Ranch, owner of Links cave; Doug Perkins and Lynn
Richardson, owners of Buddy Penleys cave; the McCo-
nnell family, owners of Catawba Murder Hole. Then
came the Guano Clusters, awards that are given to indi-
viduals who have contributed time and effort to the
club over the year. Recipients of the Guano Clusters:
Walt Pirie, for serving as one of the interfaces between
the club and the university as the Faculty Advisor; Ze-
nah Orndorff for her contributions for running our res-
cue callout; Ray Sira for his efforts in running and
maintaining the club store; Kirk Digby for his efforts in
maintaining and expanding the club gear; Lawrence
Britt for keeping the club files and rescue gear; Mike
Newsome and the Bat Ranchers for their continued
openness and friendship to club; and Doug Perkins and
Lynn Richardson for establishing Son of Picnic.
Once the niceties were over it was time to have some
fun. Matt Burnett received a stylish tie as Best Dressed
Caver. Steve LePera received the “Death and Taxes”
award for his continued efforts as Treasurer. Jessica
Dorr, Janice Matheson, Chris Hibshman, Katherine
Shelor, Mike Malsbury, and Amanda Stiles received
Certificates of Recognition for maintaining a 3.0 QCA
or higher despite the distraction of the cave club. On
the other end of the spectrum, Chris Garguilo, Joel
Bergstein, Beth Geiger, and Chris Rourke received the
“Real World Graduate Award” for opting to give the
real world a try for awhile. Eileen O'Malley received the
“Golden Keyboard” for continuation of The Trog. Ray
Sira received a Blue Ribbon for being good natured
over constant jokes about the size of his, uh, equipment.
John Deighan received a Spider Man issue for being the
club's "web crawler”, and Philip Balister received a
compass representing the guidance and direction that
he provides while maintaining the cave club listserve.
Craig Ferguson and Doug Perkins received Golden 8
Tracks for their musical contribution to club parties.
There was, of course, the standard awards. The Brain
Bucket went to Kirk Digby and Judy Wasilweski for
their "trip” in Mexico. Joe Thomson received the Good
Driver's Award for his part in the fiasco. Flameout went
to Beth Geiger. And after a year of bugging Dave, Ei-
leen O'Malley finally received her "stolen” crowbar
from last year's Banquet.

a head full of
red hair. Early reports gave her name as Elvis Ann
Beard, but the source (unca Dave Shantz) was quickly
discredited. Russ Peterson, quite taken with the little
tyke, regularly updates his FTP site with photos. (Is this
a hint, Sandy?)
WHERE'S THE WHITE PICKET FENCE?
After years of apartment-dwelling, Craig Ferguson fi-
nally bought a house in Blacksburg. He now resides on
a street just off Glade Road. The house features a huge
bathtub, a cool fake fireplace, and a phone jack in the
master bathroom. (Craig, please – I'd rather just leave a
message! The unfinished basement has already hosted
several bicycle races and the first ever Human Shuffle-
board. Stay tuned for more crazy plans which may or
may not include a roller derby.
ELECTION TIME, NEW MEMBERS, ETC.
Thank goodness the club treasurer is so good with num-
bers! After a failed attempt to elect members at a regular
Friday night meeting, the president scheduled an official
meeting to take place the Saturday of Picnic. Despite
bouts of snow and sleet, the voting members stayed
away from the fire long enough to vote for Allison Bar-
th as President, Eric Stanley as Vice President, Andrew
Oberhardt as Secretary, and Spot Rapier as Treasurer.
(It took about five years, but we finally ousted LePera
from the Treasurer's seat.) Both Eric and Andrew be-
came members earlier this semester.
