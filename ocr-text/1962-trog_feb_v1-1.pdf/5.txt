One of the purposes of the trip being to collect specimens for
Holsinger's "Biological Survey of Virginia Caves" we noted salamanders
at the base of the entrance drop, millipedes and beetles in the lower
stream passage, and several other little "critters" near the top of the
drop into the Andrews Room
* The trip was the first on which I had seen an electric lamp used
for caving, John Cooper demonstrated to us the proficiency of the
electric la mps, Run by a battery worn on the hip, a cord runs insi de
the clothing up to the lampi The battery is rechargeable and will
operate up to forty hours on a charging. It is neither larger nor
heavier than the two flasks which are required for a carbide lamp.
The lamp itself is about the same size, but lighter than a carbide
la mp, and gives far more light than a carbide flame, Standing at the
bottom of the Grand Canyon, he was able to clearly illuminate the
ceiling over 100 feet away.
Two other definite advantages are the lack of needing to refuel
and dispose of carbide. Dependability, ruggedness, id effects of
water on both the battery and the lamp are questionables, however,
Also, repairs are more complicated.
Starting into the cave with the boast "I'd rather crawl around in
the dark than use a carbide lamp," it was quite a si ght to see Cooper
traveling through the cave, electric Lamp in pocket, borrowed carbide
lamp attached to helmet with electrical tape and string, and foot in

PIT RESCUE TECHNIQUE
by George Fairer
Häribeaner )
TA
As a participant in the
field of pit caving, a caver
should always anticipate the
need to effect a pit rescue in-
volving the hoisting of an in- ol, - jured or exhausted person. Simp
hand-over-hand hoisting is
dangerous both to the victim
and to the rescuer. In using
Š this method no provisions are
made for the safety of either To person in the event that the
rescuer becomes tired and cannot hold on to the hoisting line,
There is a very simple
method, using only the equip-
ment essential to pit caving,
which can be used to effect the
rescue safely and with a minimum
of effort. The equinment invol-
ved should always be on the per-
sonof any pit cover anyway, so
no extraneous equipment has to
be carried by anyone. All that
is needed is two karibeaners,
two prussiks, and the climbing
line. The principle involved
is the age old one of the mech-
anical advantage of a block and Ý tackle. The karibeaners are
Used as pulleys and the prussiks I are used to hold the rope for
resting or rearranging the
tackle.
To use this method, a
e prussik is attached somewhere
at the top of the nit, The hoist- ing line is then lowered to the
victim who $ts in a bosons chair
tied in the end. The first
prussik holds the hoisting line
and keeps it from running free,
thus dropping the victim. A kari- beaner is attached above the
first prusik to be used as a
Bu pulley. A second prussik is
tied on the hoisting line below Ő is the first prussik and a kari-
beaner is tied to its free end. © $ The line thus goes up through
the first karibeaner, down and . U through the second and then bac
up to the rescuer. This essentially is a block and tackle with a
