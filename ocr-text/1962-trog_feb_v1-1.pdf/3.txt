NEWCASTLE MURDER HOLE CLOSED
BY GREGG MARLAND
The importance of caver-cave owner relationshops has been strongly
illustrated in the closing of Newcastle Murder Hole in Craig County,
Because of discourtesies on the part of cavers, the owner, Mr. J. S.
Sizer has announced that the cave will no longer be open to visitors.
In trying to discuss the matter with Mr. Sizer, he became quite irri-
tated and refused to talk with us
In talking briefly with he and his daughter-in-law the following
is what we could gither about the final incident, which occurred within
the last two months. A group of covers from West Virginia (one adult
and several yo?nger neople) anproached the family for permission to
enter the cave, but when advised to těll to Mr. Sizer himself, who was
out in the fields at the time, they decided not to bother to wall out
into the field to see him. They left the house and drove up to the
cave, driving across the field. After visiting the cave they arrived
at the surface during the early morning hours making considerable com-
motion and disturbing both the Sizer's and others nezrby. Having
..further mutilated the fence around the drop-in entrance, of which
other cavers have likewise been very inconsiderate, they drove back
Across the field and left without closing the gate. The following
morning Ivír, Sizer spent several hours getting his livestock back into
the pasture,
lír. sizer can in no way be blamed for being very irate with cayers
in gener. I and this lone incident will take some time and doing to
reconcile, It not appears doubtful whether or not the cave will ever
be reopened at all.
Unfortunately this is not an isolated incident for too many cavers
do not pay proper respect to the property of cave owners--fences in
particular. The loss of accesibility of this cave should encourage an
improvement in relatiorships with cave owners and define tely shows the
importance of communicatine with non-N.S.S. members.
The identity of the cavers involved in this incident could not be
ascertained, but it is believed that they were not M.S.S. members.
Mr. Sizer also brought up the topic of a cave owners liability in
case of accident and indicated that this too influenced his decision to
permanently close the cave to cayers,
