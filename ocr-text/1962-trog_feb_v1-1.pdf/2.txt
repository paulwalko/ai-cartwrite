THE TECH TROGLODYTE, Vol.I, No.1
EDITORIAL
page 2
We are nroud to announce that the Virginia Tech Dave club is once
again nublishing a newsletter, one that the hope will be a long lived
and successful publication. With the large, active membership now on
hand, and the growth that has been witnessed in the last two years we
feel that some of our activities and their results will be worth shar-
ing or preserving, and THE TECH TROGLODYTE will be the medium through
which this will be accomplished.
By way of introduction, perhans an explanation of the title of
this publication is in order. Webster defines troglodyte as "one who
creeps into holes, a hole, cavern; one of any savago race that dwells
in caves; a cave dweller; hence, any person or thing of primitive on
degraded ways of living; an anthropoid ape as the chimpanzee." Surely
all of these definitions are applicable to a certain degree and, even
though we may prefer the first , I am quite sure that those who see us
return to camous after a weekend or walk into the mess hall after an
afternoon trip would be more inclined to favor one of the latter two.
THE TECH TROGLODYTE is scheduled to be published whenever enough
material accumulates to make publication practical, with a guaranteed
minimum of once during each quarter of the school year (thrice annual-
ly). It is hoped that it will be possible to put out a copy twice
quarterly. The present subscription rate is purely experimental and
will be maintained only until it can be determined definately what the
cost and frequency of publication will be. If a change becomes neces-
sary those subscriptions already in effect will not be affected.
Reciprocal agreements with other grottes will be welcomed.
Material will be accepted from any source, provided that the
author is identified. Anonymous articles will not be printed, Material
should be sent to the editor,
Any material which is even remotely associated with caving or
that would be of interest to covers will be solicited, as will annli-
cable cartoons, Maps or other sketches should be presented on a scale
such that they will fit on a single sheet of paper, or appropriately
subdivided on separate sheets so that they can be reprodoced at the
same size, etc. as the material that is sent in.
The editor reserves the right to change the format of articles
which are submitted, tyned, double-spaced, on one side of the paper
only--but this is not absolutely necessary,
It is hoped that both spelunkers and sneleologists will see fit
to take advantage of this medium to share their findings, accomplish-
ments, and knowledge,

VIRGINIA REGION PROJECT AVATOUNCED
It has been announced by the chairman of the Virginia Region,
John R. Holsinger, that the Virginia Region Spring Project will be

West Virginia, a cave that until recently has not been noted for its
size. During the last year the cave has yielded virgin passage after
virgin passage and now has been estimated to contain at least six
