networks are less than a mile from Mammoth Cave National Park and less
than two miles from the nearest section of the 150-mile Flint Ridge
System-the margest in the world as we all know.
Roy Davis, past editor of the NSS: NEWS and owner of Cumberland
Caverns, Tennessee, has done a magnificent job of lighting the caves,
especially the dome-pits for which Joach Cave is noted. Coach Cave now
has a concession directly over the Moonshiner's Murder Hole entrance
with a staircase leading to a balcony which overlooks this 185 foot
vertical pit. Its main entrance is a quarter of a mile away and at the
bottom of the hill--much like our own Pig Hole, Moonshiners were active
in the cave in the not too far distant past. They would throw logs Ã¾r
fuel and other goods down the pit, then walk through the cave via its
lower entrance, and set up operations deep in the cave under the pit.
They certainly found privacy here. One must admire their ingenuity.
James Cave was considerably more difficult to commercialize than
Coach. When we first began exploration in James we all said it was
impossible--a venture too expensive to merit undertaking, but we didn't
reckon with Lyman's perserverance, plus the cheap manual labor in
Kentucky. The infamous hundred-yard belly-crawl has now been enkarged
to a walkway.
After we gained access to the "far sidelt of the Impossible Pit
(Forty Fathom Pit--22.0 feet--for a long time the deepest single pit
in Kentucky) by putting in a steel cable trolley line, exploration
gained momentum. We knew of the vastly complicated section known as
the Eden Extension, accessible through another lengthy belly-crawl just
off the Slab Room, and pioneered the impressive ad promising Gledila
Route, but we didn't understand how passages on the far side of the
Impossible Pit tied in with this portion. Beyond the Impossible Dit
were innumerable pits and deep canyons. One was named Ten-second
Canyon because a rock would bounce that long before reaching the bottom.
The cave in this area is unbelievably complex, Consider five or six
separate levels all within only 250 feet of limestone, and connected
bt independent dome-pits and chasms just as Floyd Collins Crystal
Cave, a few miles away, is formed. A map simply cannot display it
accurately or fully unless considered in small sections.
The inevitable finally m pnened; we made connections with the Eden
Extension at two different points--the Pizza Room and the Watermellon
Dome--and were at last able to reach the far side of the Impossible Pit
without crossing it. At last we had reaped the harvest of our efforts
and tasted the success explorers rarely gain without maximum effort.
A short distance from the Impossible Pit and on its "far side" I
discovered roots coming through the ceiling at one n... After consid-
erable surface and subterranean surveying, plus a total of 36 sticks
of dynamite, we had a new entrance--James third. Now this has been
enlarged and built into a second commercial entrance. The Impossible
Pit itself will soon have a sturdy wooden bridge spa nning its depths.
Surveying continued in our new areas and exploration opened up
more cave in the two remaining, still-promising areas--the Gledila.
Route and Key Canyon. Bill Cuddington helped us with a particula rly
difficult virgin canyon accessable through a very tight opening that
we nickna med Hope Hole, Jim puinla n, John Harshbarger, and Dave
Sherada made the long trip to Kentucky after spring exams, spendng
fi ye days caving with us in a major attempt to push back the unknown
in Key Canyon. Although we had a well stocked base camp set up in the
canyon, I felt a fast, efficient assault using the highly perfected
rope techniques we of VPI know would be better than an overnight trip
requiring us to drag sleering bags and other pertinent gear through
crawlways and up and down pits. We did accomplish a number of exciting
