Cedar Rid Crystal Cava in barion County, Tennessee is a 500:1 ex-
ample: tro rates were destroyed 59 fore cavers were forced to c9-
sent the entrance shut.‚Äù
The solution for gated 39 t caves is not so drustic: allow the
cavers to enter the cave, when the bats are zone. Many Virginia
ani nest Virginia bat caves are closed only during the winter or
suminer months whes the cave is inhabited by sither hi bernating or
nursery colonies, raspectively. Once gated, they would rema in closed
to everyone during this period of time, except for a single scienti-
fic trip to evaluate the population roosting there. However, then
the cave is not occupied by the bats, the gate could be either un-
locked and let open, like the ate in 3owden Cave, Randolph County,
"Test Virginia. A "turnstile" cate such as the one on dead pog cave
(Jef for son County, yest Virginia) could be removed entirely. Sport
cavers could the explore the cave and cave scientists could conduct
their studies. Pending the return of the bats, the cave couid je
locked up until the next "open season."
Caves such as i!ellhole,
which is closed year-round, could not be opened in this manner, and
tould have to remain closed year-round. For those caves another
solution must be found.
Thu's, gating of critical habitat caves should in theory, and if
properly done, slom or halt the decrease of M. sodalis and 2. t.
virginianus populations in the Virginfas, by Limiting their disturi-
ance by humans. To date the only widespread attempt at controlling
ca ver access to critical a bitat bat caves, through moratoriuas,
