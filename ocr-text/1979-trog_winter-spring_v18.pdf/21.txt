ON CAVE RESCUE
Our practice rescue in New River Cave this Feb-
ruary worked very well for the club. The ability of the
club to work together and to solve problems was well dem-
onstrated.
In brief summation, we were in the cave about
six hours. It was about two hours from the time we left
the Smyth Hall parking lot until the search teams located
the victim near the water fall. We carried the stretcher
from there to the Lunch Room in about four hours, where
we quit for the day. People were getting tired by then
and were not anxious to continue to the entrance and
down the hill. Another hour would have been required for
this, but the purpose of the practice, to familiarize peo-
ple with basic stretcher handling techniques, had been ful-
filled.
The practice rescue was limited to basic search
organization and to stretcher handling. This aspect of
cave rescue is the most basic and the simplist problems are
actually more extensive and more difficult to deal with.
This article will outline some of the major concerns.
contacting people in the event of a resuce can
be very time-consuming. The practice rescue had been ar-
ranged the night before and people had planned for it. In
the event of a rescue, people are likely to be scattered
throughout Blacksburg with no thoughts of going caving;
or some may already be in a cave at the far end of the coun-
ty. The distribution of people and the demand for quali-
fied cavers can make call down communications and initial
organization difficult at best.
Even though a cave rescue may be regarded as an
inside affair by cavers and cavers take pride in taking
care of their own, outside authorities must be dealt with,
The resources and knowledge of the local rescue seuads is
important. Their experience in dealing with injured peo-
ple is far greater than the club's experience. They will
have a greater range of specialized equipment than the
club and a more highly developed system of communication,
which means in cases aside from club members, they will be
notified of rescues before the club. To be the most effec-
tive in rescue situations, we must be able to cooperate with
the local authorities.
The publicity given to the rescue operation can
be beneficial to the club and rescue squad but at the same
