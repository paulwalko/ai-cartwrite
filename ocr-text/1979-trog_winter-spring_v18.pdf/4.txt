PRESIDENTS COLUMN
I first heard of the VPI Cave Club in Thailand,
back in 1973. The president of the Thai-Am caving grotto
was an ex-VPI student who had been a member of the Blacks-
burg and Roanoke extensions of the UVa grotto in the early
'60s. Coming back to the D.C. area in 1974, I hoped to go
to school at Tech and to become involved in the VPI grotto.
Now, five years later, I stand in the honored
position of president of the first student grotto in the
National Speleological Society. This was beyond my wild-
est fantasies back then.
It's been almost two years since I first walked
into Smyth Auditorium. During this time, the club has
undergone quite a face lift. As a result of a lot of
hard work and good recruiting by Ed Devine and Chuck Shorten,
the club's membership has doubled since this time last
year and our image has improved drastically.
As this school year winds down to an end, we'll
be losing some of our best cavers. In view of this and
our increase in new membership, our top priority is to
keep people caving and thereby build experience. Richard
and I also intend to increase the number of vertical work-
shops and practice rescues.
Hopefully we can accomplish a new membership
goal of a dozen cavers. There are a lot of potential
members at Tech and people who do a fair amount of caving
on their own. There could be much mutual benefit if we
can win some of these people over. This will take a good
deal of publicity and personal effort on everyone's part.
The work is cut out for us.
By the time next year's "Trog" hits the press,
I should have something more relevant to say. Until then,
I'd like to wish everyone a good summer and congratulate
Ed and Chuck on a job well done. May the hair on your
feet grow long and curly.
