ADVENTURE IN NEWBERRY'S
Fifteen people were in Newberry's that day.
Fortunately, there were four separate groups -- one be-
hind us led by R.E. Whittemore.
Our group included Hugh Beard, Chuck Shorten,
John and myself. We had rigged Triple Wells, and all
were down except Hugh, who was looking down the rope.
He said something to himself out loud, like, "Boy, that
sure would be a long way to fall." A voice replied, "It
sure would." Fortunately, when Hugh jumped, it wasn't
down the hole. Whitt had sneaked up behind him.
We finally got together at the bottom and de-
cided to do some exploring. Chuck took off in some direc-
tion; where we finally ended up, I don't know. We were
walking between two walls in a muddy stream when the tun-
nel went through a small hole and opened up to a stooping
height. A few hundred feet farther on, the passage took
a sharp right angle and narrowed to about six inches high
by two feet wide.
Obviously, it was too small ever to have been
crawled through. We shone in our lights. Thirty feet in,
it seemed to open up into a huge void. Our shouts pro-
duced a deep echo, as though it were a big room. We
started getting excited about virgin passage and new con-
nections, so Chuck crawled in a few feet and started dig-
ging.
He had done over half of it when he became too
tired to continue. I was next in line, so I crawled through
the mud and started digging. The entire passage was mud,
so it was fairly easy, but the position made it very tir-
ing. Every two feet, Chuck would ask me if I were through
yet. I definitely know the feeling of "tight" now: when
you have to dig to fit through.
One interesting thing about the passage was that
it amplified sound. I noticed it while Chuck had been dig-
ging and especially while I was in there. My heartbeat
was super loud to me, and to the others, it sounded like
a loud drum. It really freaked us out.
Anyway, I finally got to the end of the mud pass-
age. ( after only once putting my light out in the mud) and
finally was able to look up. What a disappointment! What
we had thought was a huge room was actually a small pool
of water. A few inches below where I was, it filled the
20-foot-diameter room. The ceiling, four feet above the
