surface, was a perfect dome over the round pool. The
water was clear, about two feet deep in the middle. To
my left, about eight feet away, was a mud wall. I be-
lieve the water continued around the wall, out of sight.
I could have sworn that while I was there, I heard the
others' voices, as though they were in a room a few inches
through the wall on my left. It is very probably that
the water passage is parallel to the mud passage.
The crawlway extended to the water's edge with-
out expanding, so I had to get in the water to turn around.
I had tried to back out once and knew I couldn't. I told
the others about the room. Chuck wanted to see it, so he
started through. The water at my: edge was only a foot
deep, so I maneuvered my feet into it and swung around,
putting all my weight down. I promptly sank two feet into
silt and mud. I was up to my waist in water. It was a
real strange sensation standing there. I still was not
on solid ground; there was nothing for my feet to catch
on.
I told Chuck what was happening, and that he
didn't want to have to turn around in it, so he started
backing out. I tried to get back into the passage, a
pretty good feat itself. Everything my hands could reach
was loose mud. There was nothing to kick against. I
thought for awhile that I was going to have to have Chuck
wedge himself into the passage and give me an arm to pull
myself out. Finally, however, I got out, and we proceeded
to a place in which we could stand.
I felt awfully strange with all that steam rising
from my body.
I think it would be a good idea if someone took
a rope in there and, with its protection, waded around
that left wall to see where the water goes. It may, in-
deed, lead to some new connection. Newberry's is a fas-
cinating cave, just like them all. I am glad I discovered
the cave club.
