STRANGE HAPPENINGS AT
PIG HOLE
One weekend during winter quarter, Richard Cobb
(then a brand-new member) and I (then a trainee) went to
Pig Hole for a scenic jaunt through the cave. Rich had
been there once before and had liked the drop, but had
never been in the cave itself.
The 100-foot rappel in is great because it is
mostly free. . Alongside the rope, we had red avalanche
cord for hauling equipment out at the end of the day. We
saw the Empire Ledge and the Queen's Bath, both staggering!
Since we both had things to do back at Tech, we soon started
out. We got back to the entrance and Rich cammed out and
then hauled the equipment up. I went up, and we collapsed
at the top, tired and happy, especially since I had re-
trieved the cold beer left under a tree stump.
While I started untying the rope pads, Rich started
pulling up the avalanche cord. He pulled up no more than
10 feet when he said, in a strange tone, "Feel the weight
on this cord."
I scrambled over and took it from him. Ordinarily
there would have been very little weight. But now, there
were a good five or 10 pounds on it! When I had cammed up,
the cord had been touching bottom with nothing on it.
. I started pulling the cord up. The weight re-
ma ined. I had it about 60 feet off the floor when I
looked at Rich and said, "Something is definitely wrong."
One second later, while I was still looking at
Rich, the cord ripped out of my hands. Ten feet fed through
before I caught it, rather involuntarily, I must say. My
eyes must have bugged out of my head, because Rich, who
had seen it happen out of the corner of his eye, said,
"What have you got on the end of that?".
I shook my head and started pulling on the cord
again. Rich said, "If it growls when it comes over the
edge, drop it." I was beginning to wonder with what kind
of beast I had been down there during the 15 minutes Rich
took to cam out.
I finally got the end of the cord to the lip and
pulled it over the ledge. I couldn't help but laugh.
The avalanche cord had tangled around the climb-
ing rope in two places. When I had pulled it halfway up,
one place had come loose. The weight of the rope had ripped
the cord out of my hands. What a relief!
The cave itself is fascinating and I am definitely
going back soon. I will, however, beware of Pig Hole gren-
lins.
