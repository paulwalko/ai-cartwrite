and holidays guarantee that the manpower available will
never be constant.
In dealing with more difficult situations, ve
will have to be able to judge when to call for outside
help, specifically from other grottoes in the region and
from the Cave Rescue Communications Network. Calling out-
side for help that isn't needed can be just as detrimental
as not having enough help. Other cavers may be on the
road for hours only to find the farmer's field crowded
with vehicles and the victim on the way to a hospital.
The decision to call should be made early on. In a long
rescue outside help may arrive just in time to make up
a relief crew, and the consequences of not having enough
help could be near disastrous.
Initial organization and communications are
the vaguest problems, but where the success of a diffi-
cult rescue may be. Communication is information and
organization is coordination. Information about the ex-
tent of the situation and the proposed means of solving it
are needed so the equipment and personnel can be at the
right place at the right time. Good communications can
mean that special first aid equipment that may be needed
can be called for and acquired, or that a relief crew
doesn't get lost. Good organization means that a crowd
of rescuers is not at the bottom of the drop when it is
needed at the top to haul.
This article is a brief summary of rescue prob-
lems, most of which were not considered in the New River
practice this past winter. The problems involved in cave
rescue remain pretty much the same from rescue to rescue.
The situations will vary greatly, however, Considering
solutions would require a great deal of experience and
research, resulting in a book (such as the Handbook of
Cave Rescue Operations or Single Rope Techniques. The
club and the library have copies).
I'm not proposing that the club become a super
rescue operation. But it should be realized that cave
rescue is a part of caving, just as mapping, sport caving
or pit bouncing is. If someone wants to direct their
caving efforts toward rescue techniques, there is more than
enough place for it in the caving community. Competence
in caving is the first step. Any caver on a cave rescue
better be prepared to take care of him or herself. The
caver whose main interest lies elsewhere should be aware
at least of the problems involved and should think about
how his or her own particular skills might be applied to
a rescue. Developing and practicing these skills can
be advantageous.
