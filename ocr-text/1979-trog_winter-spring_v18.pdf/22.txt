time, it can be detrimental to the caving community. To
have the club recognized as well organized and capable
of handling rescue situations is good, but locating caves
in the news media can perpetuate rescue situations.
In addition to rescue squads and publicity, the
landowner will undoubtedly want to be informed and re-
assured about the situation. The owner's property may need
to be protected from convoys of cavers coming to the res-
cue.
Hungry, tired and cold rescuers need to be taken
care of. On long rescues, they need food and a warm, dry
place to rest. Relief crews will need to be organized so
they can move in without interrupting the operation.
Bringing in relief crews, provisions and equip-
ment presents problems in communications and in logistics.
Getting accurate information from inside the cave to the
outside, where necessary equipment and relief crews are --
by passing it down 30 people -- is tenuous at best.
Different technical problems such as a drop may
be impossible to solve if the equipment isn't there, or if
all the rescuers are at the bottom of a drop when some are
needed at the top. If everyone is on the wrong side of an
obstacle, then the stretcher has to be stopped until enough
people pass the obstruction. In tight passages, the victim
himself becomes an obstacle.
Other obstacles besides drops will be encountered.
Areas that are inaccessible for stretchers, or scree slopes,
breakdown piles, mud and water, will require special atten-
tion. Extra time and additional techniques will be needed
to adequately protect the victim and the rescuers in these
situations.
The utmost concern is to avoid additional trauma
and injury to the victim. To this end, techniques and logis-
tics should be thought out carefully, and the time necessary
for this is justified. Five minutes extra worth of consi-
deration to a hauling rig may save 15-20 minutes of wrestling
the litter out of a keyhole situation. 'Proper first aid
for the victim, as far as possible, is essential. A well
organized technical effort may be wasted if first aid is
not handled carefully.
VPI has particular problems of manpower. The
turnover of students in the club means that the state of
training and leadership is in constant flux. The nature
of the club is to have a wide variety of interest in caving,
from mapping to conservation to vertical to cave biology.
The change in people insures a constant shift in emphasis
or particular interest. The quarter breaks, summer sessions
