they don't become bored. One suggestion he had was to go
ridge walking with new people to find and explore new
caves.
One no name felt there should be more trips for
meeting the prusiking, climbing, belaying requirements.
Another no name felt the requirement for the clove hitch
should be changed to the water knot, since this has more
use in caving.
Finally, two people thought it was important to
get some sort of legal agreement with Buddy Penley about
the use of his caves.
We were pleased with the response we received.
It confirmed what we had felt about the club's enthusiasm.
I can definitely state now that there will be more verti-
cal sessions next year, especially in the fall. Also,
there will be more than one practice resdae next year,
probably increasing in difficulty as the year goes on.
Win Wright is the new publicity chairman, and
he is working currently on some ideas for posters. Pat
Louden (who has foolishly volunteered her services). is
going to see if she can't come up with something to put
in the women's dorms. In addition, there is an Exposition
of campus organizations during fall check-in, and the
club has plans to set up a booth there. .
We're going to be losing a lot of our older
members next year, which means that, new members, the
future is up to you! If you had difficulty as a prospect-
ive member earlier this year finding a cave trip to go
on, remember that this fall. If there is going to be
any caving done, you are going to have to do it!
