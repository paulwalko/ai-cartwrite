V.P.
Soon after Bill and I took office, we sat down
with a few cold beers to talk over what we were going to
do (or try to do) in the next year. We could see that
enthusiasm in the club was high, and we wanted to make use
of that enthusiasm and to keep it going.
We decided to find out what the people in the
club wanted before we made any decisions. At two meetings,
I passed out some 5x7 cards and asked people to write down
their thoughts and suggestions. The following is a summary
of some of the comments we received.
Chuck Shorten, Pat Louden, Lawrence Britt, Dave
Shantz and two n√∂ names all agreed we should have more
vertical sessions. They and Win Wright thought we needed
more emphasis on rescue, Win, especially, felt that a lot
of people, especially newer members, were not prepared
to handle a real rescue.
Bill Shipman was in favor of a more structured
program for prospective members, including some type
arrangement for prospective members to cave with members
in rotation, getting more contact with different people.
Doug: Perkins thought it important that someone
make a point of speaking to new visitors personally, to
answer questions and to make them feel more comfortable.
Walt Pirie would like to see formal training
sessions on such topics as knots, pulley systems and gen-
eral caving practices.
Pat Louden, Chuck Shorten and Lawrence Britt
favored reinstating a conservation trip requirement. Law-
rence would also like to see a mapping trip be made part
of the requirements, as well as requiring every active
member to pass the knots test each year.
Jerry Redder felt more campus awareness of the
club and its activities is needed. Bill Oliver, Dave
Shantz and a no name agreed more publicity is needed.
Dave feels that the club image needs to be improved so
that we can get more women in the club. He also feels
that the parties need to be jazzed up, and that a wine,
liquor, etc., fund should be started in the treasury.
A no name agreed that we are "not drinking enough beer.
Drink beer! Raise hell!"
Bill Koerschner felt that guided tour type
trips for new members should be minimized and new members
should be involved in real caving as soon as possible so
