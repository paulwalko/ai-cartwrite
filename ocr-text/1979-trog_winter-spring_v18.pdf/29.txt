CAVE 1
SILTSPRING
Now that summer is nearly upon us, those incredible icy week-
ends of last winter are nearly forgotten,. During those slick week-
ends when most people were afraid to walk around, let alone go dri-
ving, VPI cavers were out in force, stupidly going caving. For the
fourth icy Saturday in a row several of us decided to do a little
more mapping. I felt like I needed a rest from the rigors of Paul
Penley Cave surveying so after twisting Bill Koerschner's arm and
obtaining two additional adventurous souls in the form of Win Wright
and Bill Olver, we headed out to the most obscure and ridiculous
unmapped cave we could think of - SILTSPRING CAVE.
On the way out to Staffordsville,; in Giles Co.. Virginia, where
the cave is located the temperature was starting to warm up and it
looked like most of the ice would soon be melting.. Unfortunately,
a near freezing rain had again started. Approaching the gravel road
which turned sharply off Route 100 and lead to the cave, I gunned the
engine, flew onto the slickest ice I had ever seen, hit the brakes,
and miraculously came to a précarious stop on the edge of a steep
hill overlooking Wabash Creek. After cleaning out my pants I park-
ed the car along Route 100 and we headed off through the freezing
rain in'search of Koersehner's wonderful cave.
Half a mile later, soaked and frozen, we were there. There was
rTo whiskey. wild women or song as Bill had promised. Rather, there
was a cave and several interesting karst springs. Wabash Spring,
from which all of Wabash Creek flowed was about 200 yards to the
north, The Siltspring Cave resurgence is about 100 yards to the
north but apparently is unrelated to Wabash Spring. The area ap-
peared exciting since no major caves are known dispite all this re-
surging cave water,
Siltspring Cave consists of several small connected rooms lead-
ing down to a small stream. The stream could only be followed for
a few feet up to a low, silty siphon. There was no noticable air-
flow in the cave but Koerschner had remembered considerable air
flow when he had been there several years earlier, and he had not
remembered a siphoned stream. The water was obviously way up from
the rain and melting ice and snow so it is likely that during dry,
weather there may be something substantial above this point.
Going downstream, we followed the stream under a low ledge
where Bill Olver learned how cold water could get. This immediate-
ly opened up into a steeply slanting room which went nowhere. The
stream, however, went about fifty feet further to a very low stream
crawl. As the water was already very deep in this crawl and as it
was rising, and as we weren't to far from the resurgence outside,
we decided the cave quit at this point and we exited. Total length
of surveyed passage turned out to be 383'.
It was still raining outside but Koerschner insisted that we go
check out several small holes about half a mile up the valley from
the cave, Dispité our soaked, frozen condition, we all followed
Bill, not wanting to appear un-macho.
Near where he had remembered the holes we found a fresh sink-
hole with several holes in it taking a tremendous quantity of run-
off from two small valleys. As we were poking sticks into the holes
and noticing how deep they seemed to be, my survey notebook jumped
out of my jacket and flew down one of swallow-holes disappearing
below the swirlino, muddy waters. Miraculously, several moments
later the notebook bobbed the surface and we retrieved it. With
all safe, the soggy crew returned to Blacksburg.
