UNIDENTIFIED SPELUNKER TRAPPED IN GILES CAVE
GOODWINS FERRY -- Rescue workers from Giles County
and Virginia Tech (Cave Club] were attempting to free
[carry out] an unidentified explorer who fell and was
knocked unconscious in a cave along New River late Satur-
day afternoon.
Authorities said the mishap occurred in the New
River Cave, which is off Virginia 625 in Giles County near
the Montgomery County line.
Rescuers reached the injured caver shortly after
10 p.m., but they reported it would take about two hours
to bring the victim out. There was no word on the spe-
lunker's condition.
The cave, which is several thousand feet in
length, is a popular spot for exploring by local residents
and visitors to the area, according to Glen Davis, a
member of the Virginia Tech Cave Club. The club was
participating in the rescue.
A spokesman for the Giles County Sheriff's De-
partment said someone called authorities about 6:45 p.m.
to report the caver had been injured.
Rescuers called for a generator to be brought
to the cave to light up the area [the road], the spokesman
said.
Davis said apparently the caver is not a member
of the Tech Cave Club.
The VPI graduate student said no club members
had filled out sign-up sheets to go through the cave on
Saturday.
Davis said the New River Cave is not a difficult
cavern to get through, but "if you don't know what you're
doing, any cave can be dangerous."
The cave is in the side of Gap Mountain, about
200 feet up a steep incline.
The Giles County Rescue Squad's "vertical" res-
cue team, which specializes in rescues in caves [outdoors,
from cliffs] and off mountain ledges, was participating
in the rescue along with the cave club.
