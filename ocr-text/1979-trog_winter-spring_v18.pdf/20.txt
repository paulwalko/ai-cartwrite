The exit route took them through passages two
feet wide by three feet long and only about three feet
high. A pulley system was rigged to get the stretcher
through the narrower passageways (up and down bad climbs).
Ed Devine of the cavers' organization said it
was a "very smoothly run rescue." Negotiating the
5,000-foot long cavern was helped by the fact that the
cave club had practiced a rescue inside New River Cave
only a few months ago.
Smith was carried out of the cave and down a
steep hillside to a waiting ambulance about I a.m. (near-
er midnight), almost 12 hours after he went inside. He
was rushed to Montgomery County Hospital and then taken
to Roanoke.
Davis said the Radford College business major
apparently never lost consciousness despite his injury.
He was in a stupor during most of the rescue, and his
father said Sunday he was still groggy from the incident.
The elder Smith, who praised the rescue efforts,
said his son suffered a possible hairline fracture of
the skull and would be laid up several days.
Smith added his son had not done much cave
exploring, and he hoped Saturday's adventure would be
his last experience.
The father suggested that caves on private pro-
perty be either plugged or declared off limits to those
without caving experience.
Devine said Smith was the first person to be
seriously injured at New River Cave in recent years. The
labyrinthine cavern is located in the side of Gap (Spruce
Run] Mountain near Goodwins Ferry in Giles County and is
a popular spot for novice as well as experienced spelunkers.
