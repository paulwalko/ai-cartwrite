Problem o: Protection
Populations of all bat species in the United States have been
declining of thin the last several years, especially caye-dvelling
populations. Caves formerly containing millions of bats nor harbor
only a fem thousand. Some colonies are now extinct. Three species
of bat
have been placed on the e.ldan gered species list, and others
are being considered. Many factors have contributed to this alarm-
ing dro popf in bat populations: increased disturbance of bat caves
by cave explorers and scientists, flooding of winter roost sites
during early spring, and in juries due to banding.
ottho:1.gh 3ats everywhere are in need of protection, in Virginia
and ?est Virginia cavers and scientists are concerned mainly vith
the Indiana social bat (w yotis sodalis) and the Virginia big-eared
bat (plecotus tomsendii virginianus). w. sodalis has been on the
endan gered species.list since 1965, and R. t. virginianus has re-
cently added. soÄŸulations of both of these species of 5t have been
steadily decreasing in recent years, 90 alarmingly that bat research-
ers and the iational Speleological Society (5S) have become concerned,
