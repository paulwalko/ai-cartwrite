SKYDUSKY HOLLOW
The past six months have seen the completion of
two major mapping projects and the beginning of another
by members of the VPI Cave Club. Steady effort in Spring
Hollow Cave has pushed the cave to beyond the predicted
four miles. The strike-parallel base level trunk was
mapped to siphons at either end, but a surprise find
renewed hopes for the elusive connections to neighboring
Newberry-Bane's and Bane Spring Caves. This lead began as
a low belly crawl carrying a small tributary stream but
soon opened up into dry canyon passage. This lead was
mapped 2,000 feet straight southwest to within striking
distance of upstream Banes. The passage in fact passed
under the eastern portion of Banes Spring, which lies
150 feet above it. This high potential lead was recently
mapped to a fork where it split into two wet and very
windy belly crawls which unfortunately (fortunately?)
proved to be entirely impassable.
Thus Spring Hollow officially has zero leads
left and a length of 4.15 miles, though one additional
trip will probably be taken to insure nothing has es-
caped notice.
The success of the Spring Hollow survey has in-
spired renewed effort in some of the other Skydusky Hollow
caves. The dry fall season saw completion of Harman's
Avalanche Pit with only 1,200 feet of passage, but a
depth of over 200 feet (and that without a rigged drop).
After completion of this survey, Ed Devine began the mon-
umental task of surveying neighboring Paul Penley Cave,
the only totally unmapped cave in the hollow. This high-
ly complex 3-D ma ze strains even the best cartographer's
abilities as the 2.5 miles surveyed so far fit under only
six acres. On a recent mapping trip, all 92 stations fit
on a single surveying notebook page at 40 feet to the inchi
The survey is now at the edge of the known por-
tions of the cave and virgin passages are beginning to
turn up. Recently a small trickle stream was pushed to
a sump of a depth of 324 feet, making this cave one of
the deepest in the Skydusky Hollow system.
This same trickle was pushed upstream through a
series of low, sloppy stream crawls (dubbed Wallow Hollow)
to a new section of cave with airflow enough to rattle
a lamp flame! This area is only 300: feet away from down-
stream Harman's and a handshake connection seems possible.
The cave contains two large streams which are expected to
join near base level (about -350') and hopefully form a
passage of truly admirable proportions. At present, leads
are still proliferating and a length of 3 miles plus seems
a certainty.
