CAVE of the RISING SUN
There is a cave in Skydusky
They call Newberry-Banes
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
who tried to map that cave.
So when you're out a-drinkin'
A-laughin' and havin' fun
A-pity the poor boys a-mappin'
way down in Newberry-Banes.
so it's one foot in the entrance
the other in the grave
I'm going back in Newberry-Banes
to wear that ball and chain.
Yes I'm goin' back to Skydusky
to the cave called Newberry-Banes
I'm going back to spend my life
A-mappin' that Goddamn cave.
