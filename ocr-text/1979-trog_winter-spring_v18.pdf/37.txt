represents a very small percentage of the total cavas found in each
state and illustrates the selectiveness of the bats in choosing
roost caves.
Cavers and scientists disturging this ilmited number of roost
sites constitutes the greatest threat to these endangered species,
30th bats are quite sensitive to man's intrusion, and mea disturb
ed may move to another part of tne cave or leave the cave entirely."
Caves suitable as habitat for these two species are "relatively
rare," +% and if a colony leaves its cave in winter it will probably
froze before it inds another suitable roost.
Therefore, limiting buman access to these caves, particularly
during hibernation periods (1 October to 1 May) 0, is of significant
importance in stopping the plurimeting population levels of M. sodalis
and 2. t. virginianus.
This paper will attempt to deal with some
of the complications. of gatin, bat caves in the Virginias.
Alany organizations are seeking a solution to the problems of
protecting cave-dwelling bats. Yithin the Vatical speleological
Society (SS), the fat Su ocomnittee actively works on various as-
pects of sat conservation. The various regional VSS divisions are
also forming 14t-associated committees, such as the Virginia Area
Region's jat subcomnittee. The Richmond Area Speleological society
of the VaR compiles a list of current "limited access cavest--
