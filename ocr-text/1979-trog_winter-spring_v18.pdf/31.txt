CAVE 2 HARMONS AVALANCHE PIT
The most striking feature about Harmon's Avalanche Pit is
the fact that there is no pit at all. just several short, climb
able drops.
Harmon's Avalanche Pit is the smallest of the significant
caves of the Skydusky Hollow Cave System in Bland Co., Virginia.
It is found between Coon Cave at the extreme western end of the
system and Paul Penley Cave.
During January, 1978, Doug Perkins, Jim Eller, and Ed Devine
decided to kill a Saturday by mapping a small cave that could be
finished up in one day and then forgotten. Ed had remembered find-
ing the entrance to Avalanche Pit while ridgewalking during the
previous VPI Grotto picnic which had been held near the entrance
to Newberry Cave to the east. The Avalanche Pit was only supposed
to be "several hundred feet long" according to Caves of Virginia.
Being a Skydusky Hollow cave, they should have known better. The
cave took four trips to finish, went to 208" in depth and surveyed
to about 1200'.
The cave starts out deceptively as a steeply descending trunk-
like passage thirty feet high and eight feet wide. This is enter-
ed through a steeply spiraling passage which "avalanches" mud and
rocks as one descends - hence the name. Unfortunately, after about
fifty feet the nature of the cave completely charges becoming a
low crawling passage. At the beginning of this part of the cave, a
side passage is encountered which leads back toward the entrance
and mud fills after about 70'.. The main passage changes from a
low crawl to a narrow, tight canyon leading to the top of a crevice
drop of about 30'. This drop can be free-climbed but is so narrow
that a cable ladder is almost essential for getting back up. The
drop opens up on a canyon passage with a trickle stream. On the
left side of the passage leading to the top of this drop, a tight
lead was dug open which leads to climbable drop which also opens
up on the trickle-stream canyon.. This drop is the preferable means
of getting into the depths of the cave as it is significantly eas-
ier to negotiate.
The cave is very straight-forward from this point. It contin-
ues as a narrow, frequently tight trickle-stream canyon for about
four or five hundred feet that finally reaches a six-inch wide
pinch in bedrock that could not be pushed. Several short, climbe
able pitches are encountered before this end is reached.
The end of Avalanche Pit comes within two or three hundred of
the known portions of Paul Penley Cave where numerous going leads
are currently being explored and where a trickle stream similar to
to Avalanche Pit stream has been encountered. It appears that it
is only a matter of time before a hand-shake connection will be
made between the two caves.
This survey project was a classic example of how not to map a
cave quickly. Figuring the cave was only a few hundred feet in
length, the first trip told the owner that they would be out "well
before dinnertime" and therefore ran out of time. The second trip,
figuring they had to be about through with the survey, did the ex-
act same thing. Incredibly, the third trip, not having learned yet,
repeated the mistake. The fourth trip knew better and finished up
the cave but was unable to push the super-tight slot at the cave's
end.
