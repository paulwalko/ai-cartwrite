NEW RIVER RESCUE, BY
THE GROTTO
The article on cave rescue problems was written
just before the recent rescue in New River Cave. Most
of the problems mentioned were handled very well.
The Redders handled the initial organization
very well. When we got to the cave Jackie was able to
to tell us the situation so that we could fit right
in to the effort so far.
Back in Blacksburg we spent about an hour
on the phone contacting people. When we had a fair
sized group together we left for the cave. Pat Louden
stayed at the phone to contact people we hadn't gotten
in touch with and to provide a relay point for information.
Ironically, only one group had gone caving that
Saturday so the entire club was available with the
exception of a few who were out of town.
When we got there Don Anderson, Pete Sauvigne,
Jerry Redder and several of the Giles County Rescue
Squad were already in the cave. First aide was being
administered and Pete and Don were on their way out to
tell us where the victem was.
Once in the cave the scene was a reinactment
of the practice rescue we had in February, but with
twice as many people.
The stretcher moved rapidly out of the cave. Scott
Smith was out of the cave no more than 2 1/2 hours after
we put him in the stretcher. Then only problem was a
communication concerning a blanket, which was asked
for, abtained, but never used.
The Giles County Rescue Squad was our greatest
asset. Perhaps we should say that it was their operation
and we helped them. Whatever view point we take, we are
very fortionate to have the Giles County Squad to work
with.
