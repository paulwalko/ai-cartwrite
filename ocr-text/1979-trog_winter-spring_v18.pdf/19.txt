From the Roanoke Times & World-News Monday, May 21, 1979:
DAD THANKFUL SON IS ALIVE AFTER FALL IN GILES CAVE
Joseph C. Smith was at his son's bedside in
Roanoke's Community Hospital Sunday thankful that the 20-
year-old Radford College sophomore was alive.
"Any person going into a cave untrained without
any equipment is a fool," said the Winchester restauranteur.
It took rescue workers from Giles County and the
Virginia Tech Cave Club about four hours to carry Scott
Morgan Smith out of New River : Cave late Saturday.
Smith had gone into the cave off Virginia 625
Saturday for an exploring trip with two companions. The
trio neglected to take proper equipment and had scant
experience in caving, according to a spokesman for the
Giles County Rescue Squad.
When Smith fell about 20 feet off a walkway
[mudbank] and suffered a gash in his head [imbedding an
arrow-point like piece of chert between his eyes that
took surgery to remove), what started as a leisurely trip
almost became a tragedy.
Smith's father said his son, who was in satis-
factory condition at the hospital, had been in the cave
about three hours when the mishap occurred.
When Smith hit the cave floor, an inch-long rock
became imbedded in his head. "He said he reached up and
tried to pull the rock out of his head and couldn't do
it," the father said.
Doctors told the injured student he looked as
though he had been hit with a tomahawk. "The doctor said
he had a hard head," Smith said.
The younger Smith fell about 5 p.m. By the time
rescue personnel got to the cave, it was after 7.
Steve Davis of the Giles County Rescue Squad
said when rescuers reached Smith he had a deep gash on
his head and his body temperature was extremely low. Davis
said that Smith had fallen into a creek inside the cave
and his clothes were soaked.
While rescue squadsmen attempted to stabilize
Smith's condition, about 20 [25] Virginia Tech Cave Club
members prepared to take him out by stretcher (Stokes).
