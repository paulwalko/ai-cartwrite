I cannot use the phone until Blacksburg P. D. has a chance
to call back.
Pat Louden calls. Frame and Suzanne are going.
Blacksburg P.Do. phones. No area squad has
what's needed. Officer Robertson suggests calling Roanoke
County.
Roanoke County emergency says it will call someone.
A woman officer is very nice. She says if it were here
body in a cave, she would want someone to get it out. She
promises to call me back.
5:05 a.m. Earlow calls back through Blacksburg
P. D., who are patched into him. The cave is 2 1/2 hours
away. West Virginia State Police are standing by the
Virginia line to show rescuers from Tech where to go.
Roanoke County emergency wants to know which
rescue squad in its area to call. I don't know.
5:20 a.m. I wish Roanoke County would call
back. Perkins is still on hold, told to wait to see if
he has a stretcher near there to pick up. We need an
equipment inventory of local squads.
Roanoke County calls! They say Fort Lewis rescue
might have what we need. The woman's name is Dispatcher
Kirby.
5:34 a.m. I call Perkins, tell him to hold on.
I phone Glen Davis, tell him to wait for Perkins.
5:50 a.m. Cecil Crockett telephones me. He has
two stretchers made in that style, and he is down at the
Fort Lewis rescue building in West Salem, waiting for them
to be picked up. I say a silent prayer for helpful people
on this holiday dawn.
My list of rescuers now includes Carolyn Lewis.
They'll leave Blacksburg at 6:15 a.m.
6 a.m. I call Blacksburg P.D. to relay to Barlow
that the stretchers are one the way. They advise Bland 19
that stretchers ETA 8 or 9 a.m. and that seven Blacksburg
cavers are leaving at 6:15 a.m.
There is one dash to our Montgomery Street house
for rescue equipment, and they're gone. That evening we
rehash among those who stay behind.
