MARYLAND system
FREE STATE VERTICAL CAVING-HTIE MARY WIND SYSTEM"
Maryland is not known or its vertical caving. Most bardcore
Maryland cavers, when quizzed on rope len th for one of t ne ei gnt or
ten drops needing one, will sagely reply "six hundred feet." Alter
the listener has regained his com posure, ne adds "Throw it in the pit,
coilod. Then jump in on it."
Joking aside, Maryland vertical cavin z does present challenges.
on a Christmas trip to Round Top Summit cave (Washington County) with
three Frederick rotto members, we were raced with a mere 20 foot ent-
rance pit--but 15 of those twenty feet required wall-walking and the
last three were in a 1.5 x 4 foot slot. My Mitchell system was useless;
on an earlier trip it required 15 minutes for me to manipulate the low-
er Jumar through the entrance slot,
To solve this lower ascender uroblem I switched to a poot Gibbs
(figures 1-3). I planned to use a chest harness clipped to the rope
and pass my long Jumar-foot sling behind it (as in the Mitchell
System), letting my legs do the work and putting the second ascender
where I could reach it easily. But complications arose when a young
lady sharing my rig had difficulty with the chest sling.
I modified the rig by substituting my short rest sling (Mitchell
System) attached to Amy's Texas seat and a Jumar for the long Jumar-
to-foot sling arrangement. With the Gibbs cam on her left foot, she
had the Maryland equivalent of the Texas System--Bruce Miller dubbed
it "the Maryland System."
Impressed with Anny'ease in climbing out using the Maryland sys-
tem, Bruce and I also used it. Negotiating the entrance slot was
simplified as one took small (6-87) bites and kept the Jumar-seat sling
tight, using a sit-stand technique. The drop that had previously tak-
en me twenty winutes now took me two.
Modifying the system for permanent use, the la tubular webbing
Jumar rest sling is replaced by 5/16" HMI Pit Rope (for abrasion re-
sigtance and low stretch), threaded through the holes in the Jumar
handle and tied together in a double-tucked sheet bend, fisherians
knot or the equivalent. The Maryland System is particularly useful
for narrow vertical drops where a Gibbs ropewalker system is prefer-
red but the caver doesn't want to sew a lot of webbing or has only
Jumars and the gibbs from his rappel safety. As a drop opens out,
other systems become more efficient. But hard-core maryland cavers"
will continue to use the system--at least until their evolutionary
development gives them wings or suction cup toes.
