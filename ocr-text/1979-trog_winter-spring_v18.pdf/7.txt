Editor's Column
Judging from this Trog , the V.P.I. Grotto
has been increasingly active. At least we have a Trogg
that nobody is going to read completely during the meeting.
Again I want to thank Laura Alderson for
doing the typing and Pat Louden for the illustrations.
The next Trogg will be even better with more humor,
more project reports, more technical articles, more
cartoons, more graphics, more trip reports, and more
exciting stories about the V.P.I. Grotto. IoThy? Because
Bill Sydor is the next editor.
