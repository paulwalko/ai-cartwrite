FRIAR'S HOLE INCIDENT
About 3 a.m. July 4, 1978, the phone range. I
stumbled to the receiver and heard the deep, unmistakable
voice of Beb Barlow say, "Is Bob there?" Where the devil
was Bob, I wondered. Then I remembered. He was studying
goat barns, the Alps and other structures in Switzerland
for the summer.
I suppressed the urge to reply, "He's in Switzer-
land. Want his phone number?"
Barlow, in his typical deadpan, explained the
situation: body in Friar's Hole, in Greenbrier County off
Route 219. Two 30-foot drops inside, water in both.
Greenbrier people already there. Morgantown is sending
some. Cave Rescue Communications Network called. Need
six people from Tech. Need evacuation stretcher with
wooden slats, Barlow was getting on the road. Call him
back through police department, Pland Car 19.
We discussed which he needed most, wet suits or
the stretcher. Barlow said the stretcher.
he following are the notes I took that early
morning while coordinating phone contacts.
4:10 a.m. I call Doughty, who is the nearest
to the cave who's liable to be home this holiday. Pam
sleepily replies they've caved all day, they're too tired.
I call back Barlow. Fle says try to get four
pecple.
4:40 a.m. Andy Wnuk can't go, his parents
are visiting. I consider calling Pete Sauvigne out of
Pearisburg, but discard that. He has family plans for
July 4th, probably. He'll be good backup if needed later.
I get Ed Devine, Nancy Moore, and call Chuck
Shorten. Pat Louden answers. "Hello, Pat?" I say. "It's
cave rescue time !".
I call Doug Perkins in Roanoke. He'll hold on
for while to see what situation calls for.
4:45 a.m. I call Blacksburg Police to contact
area rescue squads in case they have the right stretcher.
Officer Robertson promises to have a squadman call me back.
Blacksburg P.D. is glad to help. They are bored this time
of holiday morning, know they can't go out of their juris-
diction, but are willing to help coordinate.
4:50 a.m.
get cave location.
I need to get in touch with Barlow to
I should have asked him better directions,
