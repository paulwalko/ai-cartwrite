is concerned mainly with purchasing ani ja tincaves rocomized as
critical habitat for the Virginias' en jan gered vat species. The.
wki 37's goal of gating and controlling access to bat caves is 20ble,
but hardly feasible without the widespread support of cavers and

several organizations do have the funis necessary to
urchase
cave entrances, if and whea the property becomes available for sale,

of "7ildlife. If these or anizations can be convinced of the effect-
iveness of gating, then the money obstacle pould be overcome. 40-
