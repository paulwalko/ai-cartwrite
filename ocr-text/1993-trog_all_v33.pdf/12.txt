The weather at OTR was kinda nice, kinda rainy. So what else is new? Everyone had
fun, everyone was hung over. The Elvis Grotto was a little too quiet this year, and some of us
missed the Naked Disco. Maurya and Paul K. both celebrated birthdays over the weekend
(guess which one is older?).
If you hung around the VPI tarp for too long, you had to listen to the old farts
complaining about how OTR was currently being handled – but they were still glad someone
else was running it!
VPI did well in the contests, but it looks like the adults were left in the dust by Andy
Loud and all three Zos, who collectively cleaned the place out.
Kirk took to the stage Saturday night and played some of his favorite tunes on the
guitar. The only enthusiastic fans were from VPI (the ones who should know better), until he
started playing "Charlotte the Harlot", which got everyone's attention.
Brian Cruikshank made a guest appearance at OTR and spent the weekend walking
around hugging people. I guess it gets lonely in the Rockies with no one but the marmots to
keep a man warm at night.
Spotty Dog and Lawrence headed up a caravan of five vehicles for some four wheelin'
on Sunday. The winches were only used twice. Just how deep is that pool of mud,
Lawrence?
In September the property out at Buddy's was auctioned off. The Zos were on hand to
pick up a few favored items from the house (just ask Carol about the deer head). Molly owns
the mountain, and Doug Perkins and Lynn Richardson purchased the plot of land that holds
the entrance to Buddy Penley's Cave. So far they deny any plans to build a house and start a
family. One of the bigger concerns has been resolved: Yes, picnic will continue to take place
where it always has. Molly says she wouldn't want it any other way.
Practice Rescue took place in November. Poor Spotty Dog was "injured" in New
River. Lucky for him, there was a large trainee turnout to save the day. Okay, so the little
container of Jack tucked into his suit helped as well. It took six hours and lots of learning to
get him out and down the mountain. Despite some confusion
("Who's in charge here, anyway?"), the rescue went well. Everyone survived spending a day
underground with each other, though it was touch and go for awhile there.
The club welcomed a whopping two new members since the last issue. Alison
Williams joined the ranks first, and was followed a month later by Susan Vermeulen (it's about
damned time!). They both did well on their tests and were voted in with only a few people
cursing and spitting on the floor.
The Halloween party took place at the Church of Rock & Roll, Alan and Shannon's
new digs. Alan and his band played for us with only a minimal amount of repetition ("Didn't
they just play this one?"). Shannon grabbed a microphone and treated the early morning
stragglers to a song. We suspect it was aimed at getting people to leave so she could finally
go to bed.
Amy organized the decorating (nice job!) and the clean-up crews, which was a good
excuse for some people to crash there. Even before the last die-hard partiers were finished,
people were found sleeping on the sofa, on the floor, and even on other people (yes, Amy and
Bob, we have pictures!).
This year's party hosted quite a variety of faces. Some of those that attended: Lui
Cifer, The Phantom of the Opera, Officer Friendly, and of course The Cereal Killer. You could
even sit on Santa Claus' lap (but only if you're female – Ray's not that jolly).
