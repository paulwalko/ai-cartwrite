Starnes Caverns Trip Register
by Lawrence Britt
* NOTEThis is NOT a sign-out log. Each trip is still res-
ponsible for their own sign-outs elsewhere. .
The Trip Register is now in place for Starnes Caverns. The
register is in a mailbox on the left side of the Price's driveway
about 100 yards from the house. The mailbox and three registers
have been donated by the VPI Grotto to serve two purposes. The
first is to give the Prices something to read and enjoy in return
for putting up with the countless trips people make to their cave.
The second, and most important, is in response to something Mr.
Price said to me once. He was getting a little tired of people
knocking on his door early on weekends and of the 'un'inhibited'
changing of clothes. So, now the mailbox area is the place to
park and change. It is just out of sight of the house. Four
exerpts from the register guidelines follow:

* Unless Mr. Price has put a note to the contrary inside this
book, you have his permission to enter the cave. There-
fore, please DON'T go up to the house and disturb them.
When they see your car parked here, they know someone is
underground.
* Even in the worst of weather, Mr. Price does NOT want
anyone to drive up to the entrance or anywhere else on his
property. Common courtesy goes a long way!
* Please leave the gates in the postition you found them;
open if they were open, closed if they were closed.
* Park on this side of the road leaving the gate unblocked.
With the register in place, let us hope that we can maintain
the great landowner relations that the Prices have always given
usi
By the way, Starnes is now 3.4 miles long and still growing
thanks to the efforts of Dave Colatosti, Steve Wells, and myself.
When the survey is completed, a new map will be published.
