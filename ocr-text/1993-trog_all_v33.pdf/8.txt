Clover Hollow on Cable Ladders
It was an interesting idea, something Kirk had been
discussing for days. He had asked me if I wanted to go on a
Clover Hollow trip using all Cable Ladders. The trip sounded
somewhat unusual so I thought I should go. It was a Thursday
night trip, and Kirk had managed to round up Bob Cosby, Carol
Zokaites and myself to take part in the excursion.
We managed to rig the three drops with cable ladders without
too much difficulty. The entrance required two ladders, the
canyon took three while the flowstone only used one. We also
rigged all drops with Goldline. Up until now I had never had
the pleasure of rappelling on Goldline, and Bob and I made the
same observation about it during the canyon drop - which is
the fact that not only do you spin but you bounce as well.
Needless to say it was quite an experience! At the bottom of
the canyon we decided to do only the regular tourist trip since
the rigging ate up a lot of time. As we approached the canyon
I realized I had never climbed more than twenty feet of ladder
and my stomach sank. As Kirk looked up at seventy-five feet
of ladder he noted that it looked "majestic". Carol was the
first to the top so she belayed all of us. It only took about
two minutes each for the rest of us to climb the ladder, and
when I thought about that I decided I really liked cable ladders.
Being able to get everybody up the drops so fast was fantastic
and it seemed like we were out of the cave in no time at all.
Carol informed me that using cable ladders used to be standard
practice, and based on my trip I think they should be used more
often. If you've never done a trip with cable ladders you might
find you've been missing out.

Quicklaces and Cable Ladders
Anybody who has climbed up a crumby drop on a cable ladder
in quicklace boots need not hear the annoyance it causes. This
is something cool I saw at old Timers Reunion during the ladder
competition to solve this classic problem. You can use a small
washer or D-rings placed within the quicklace, and hammered
or bent down. Presto! No more quicklaces!
