TRIP REPORT: HELL
Sunday, the Seventh of February finally made it to Hell. With
me were my faithless companions Steve, Sandy and Amy. We were going
to survey a large and clean virgin passage, but it required
I traversing a bunch of nasties to get to it. With all the excitement
I felt it was my obligation to be trip whiner of the four of us,
Amy was the only person who had never been there.
We got there, we donned gear, We came, We saw, etc...the
entrance passage certainly wasn't a barrel of laughs, and that was
only the beginning. When we came to what is lovingly named 'Piece of
Shit Pit' I began to seriously debate the wisdom of what I was here
for. In order to cross the pit it is necessary to hang from a column
which is forty feet in the air. When one is covered in mud and tired
it becomes trickier than it sounds.
After reaching the end of the old survey, a steep mud slope
beckoned us to survey it. I feel that all trainees should be
required to read instruments while lying in several inches of mud.
Thanks to Sandy we managed it in only three shots. The passage
descended through a hole in the floor and I tempted fate by
following; unfortunately my helmet stayed wedged in the slot and my
head with it.
The passage itself was very impressive; where I had been in
closet sized passage before, I was now in a room as big as my old
dorm room(ooohhhhhh). This ended shortly in a break down pile, and my
excitement faded as I found myself in a breathing pinch. On the way
out I had another look at a dome that interested me, once again I was
Ã¢ unable to explore it due to a pinch at its mouth.
After our thirteen hour ordeal a feast at Hardees was well
deserved and enjoyed. Until the next time - Life is Hard, Cave
