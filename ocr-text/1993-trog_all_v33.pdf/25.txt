monumental demand for acetylenes, especially cleaner acetylenes,
also brought the death of carbide as it could not efficiently
keep up with demand.
Carbide Production
3C = CaOmelt --> CaC2melt + CO ; AH=+465 KJ
Step 1: Carbon Production (C)
The carbon used for carbide production can come from a
variety of sources. The popular and plentiful is coke because it
is a bountiful by-product of the coal industry. Also Nieuwland
states that it is "the most often used today because of it's high
electrical resistivity." (7). Some of the early sources of carbon
have been charcoal, bituminous coal, lignite, bitumen, pitch,
tar, peat, and wood. (Nieuwland,8).
The resulting carbon product to be used in carbide
production has some limitations. "The carbon(coke) component used
in large closed furnaces has a grain size of less than 25mm. The
ash content should be less than 15% and water less then 2%. If a
high phosphorous content is in the ash the calcium phosphine
which is produced from it in the furnace will react with water to
give phosphine, a toxic substance which gives carbide it's
typical odor. Carbide standards permit only 0.006% PH; by
content.! (Payne, 41).
The carbon material is transported to the carbide production
facility and stored for future use. (See diagram CAR-1 for a
schematic of a coke furnace).
