A Note on Knots
In recent years we have seen a rise in the popularity of
small, easy-to-use, two point-of-contact vertical rigs. The
Mitchell and Frog systems are just two examples. This article
is not about their merits or their safety. Everyone has their
own opinions on that. This is written merely to draw a parallel.
In finding ways to move through a cave quicker, some cavers
have been using two knots (prussik, helical, or other) to climb
up small drops; a small drop typically being one of forty feet
or so. Some people think that using two knots saves time in
rigging and derigging. Whether the time saved is worth the
safety risk is another sore point of contention among cavers.
Regardless, the two knot system is in use - even I prefer it
in some cases.
Ok, so where is the parallel? Well, these short drops
that many of the mechanical two point systems work so well for
are, typically, nuisance drops against a wall. In a properly
rigged two point mechanical system both ascenders are tethered
to the caver's seat. This prevents the disastrous heel hang
if the top point fails. However, as Doug Bruce has pointed
out, if there is a failure of the top knot a major heel hang
is induced. If this system is used on the aforementioned type
of drop the impact of caver against wall could be as damaging
as a fall.
If one were to continue using a two knot set-up for short
drops it would be wise to incorporate the tethering idea that
most mechanical two point systems use. Here is one solution
to the problem.. Put an appropriate mid-line knot in your foot
prussik. It should probably be located fairly close to the
ascending knot on your prussik cord. Then use some hardware
(quick links or such) and a length of webbing or prussik cord
to attach the mid-line knot to your seat. To minimize the fall,
the length of the tether should be as short as possible without
impeding your climbing ability.
This addition to your rig is minimal in complexity and
weight, and might provide additional safety. This idea could
also be very easily adapted to the classic three knot system.
