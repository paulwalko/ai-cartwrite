ksed s'rotide eht morf
I would like to take this opportunity to both apologize
for the lateness of this rag that you are currently reading
and to thank those of you who have helped it to become the rag
that it is. Not a bad rag, mind you, but something that's useful
for all sorts of things. Like putting under the dog's bowl.
Or as doormats. Lots of folks use as 'em as doormats. I'd
also like to apologize for all the different typefaces, print
styles, and weirdness that must abound in this publication.
As I sit here and type this I, yes even I, am not sure what
the final end product will be. I miss my Ko, my constant Rock
of Japan to stabilize me on the long, cold, lonely nights during
Trog season. Be assured then, my wanderer in the north known
as Troy, that you could only be succeeded. Know then, kind
(or unkind) readers that without Ko the Trog lost it's grasp
on any sort of computer lab with fine Virginia Tech laser
printing capabilities - and I do not have a computer. Armed
with that knowledge go in peace(s) with something of an answer
to the question of how formats this thing is written on.
