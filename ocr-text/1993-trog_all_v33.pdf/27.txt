cooling. Most furnaces are three phase, where the electric power
is supplied by three electrodes protruding into the furnace
vessel.(Payne,36). The electrodes are surrounded by contact
plates, usually made of copper through which the electrical power
supply flows. (Payne, 37).

A transformer regulates the correct voltage to the furnace.
"Heat is generated by the passage of the current between the
electrodes... and directly through the highly resistant charge of
the raw materials." (Nieuwland, 8).
