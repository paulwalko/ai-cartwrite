UNEXPECTED CAVING IN CROSSROADS
On a nice summer evening, I had absolutely no intentions
. of being underground. I just wanted to eat dinner with a few
friends at Leah's house and enjoy a laidback Saturday night.
But I guess the cave gods had something else in mind because
not long after we, Leah, Mark Eisenbies, Alan, Shannon, and
myself, finished eating, we heard about the rescue. Scott
appeared at the door around 8:00 and soon Mark and I were off
to collect our caving gear. Unfortunately, I was only visiting
Blacksburg for the weekend and all my caving gear was still
back in New Castle where I was living for the summer. With
the help of Mark and Ko, I was able to put together everything
I needed. It was one of the first examples that night of cavers
helping other cavers.
Not long after we got the news, Mark, Scott, Patty, Rich
Geisler, Ko, Joan, and myself were ready to head out of town
on the way to Crossroads cave. We had a caravan of three cars
and about a two and a half hour drive to the cave. Around 11:30
that night we reached the cave and I could see that this was
not going to be like any previous caving experience or practice
rescue. I remember being amazed at the number of people and
lights. I was very excited about the thought of being able
to help out a fellow caver, and there was definitely a rush
of adrenaline. After the five of us, Patty, Rich, Scott, Mark
and I were suited up and ready to go, we were told that we would
have to wa√Æt and that they may need us later. I remember trying
to sleep for a while but the excitement and the noise were too
much to allow me to get any sleep.
Finally, around 4:00 in the morning, I got to go on one
of the first relief crews with four other people. I can't say
too much about the injured caver or about how things were run
inside the cave because I really don't know that much. I was
there to help and do whatever I could to make things go smoothly.
The caver had dislocated his shoulder and was able to walk out
for most of the way. Mostly, I tried to provide support and
handholds and footholds while he slowly made his way out of
the cave. At one point he was put into a stokes but we only
carried the litter for a short ways before the paramedics took
him out of the stokes. They were able to pop his shoulder back
into place so he could continue walking out of the cave. Six
hours later, the injured caver was out of the cave and cavers
began hauling the tons of gear out of the cave.
I suppose what I will remember the most about this rescue
is how everyone worked together and helped each other. Cavers
came from all over to help out another caver that they had never
met before and I think that is the best example of how cavers
care and look out for each other. Although I didn't have the
chance to go on any of the summer's other rescues, I will always
have fond memories of the trip to Crossroads and how I was able
to help just a little on such a big rescue.
