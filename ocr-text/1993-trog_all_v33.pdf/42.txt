I do not understand the gross inconsistency of Knutson's
opinion. How can he condemn a practice like bottom belaying
when it obviously has its merits. Anything can happen outside a
caver's influence that could cause an uncontrolled rappel (i.e.
induced unconsciousness), and if you learn anything from the
accident reports it should be that accidents happen. Belays can
save and have saved lives. I understand the risk of rockfall,
but many things can be done to address this issue. Most common
is to belay from under a protected overhang. Another possibil-
ity is to rig a belay redirection in the rockfall zone using
some sling and a carabiner while applying tension from a safer
vantage point. Two things that should be noted are that belays
do become ineffectual on drops longer than 400 feet, and unpro-
tected blind pits should be bounced.
I have only one example of where the facts of an accident
were misrepresented and left out; still, how do I know they
weren't in other cases? The case of Fern Cave, AL (Mar. 11, pg
343) shows what advantage Knutson has with hindsight. I am not
defending the actions of these cavers, but Knutson had many of
his facts wrong which helped explain their actions. The primary
cause of this accident was failure to be properly informed. The
rest of the mistakes were made under stress with the possibility
of an injured caver. Knutson failed to mention that Dave Cola-
tosti was an EMT, and that he decided to descend with emergency
supplies. Also he misrepresents the group saying they were
there with the intention of doing a waterfall drop in cotton and
trash bags. I get the impression they would have preferred to
have dropped at the dry rig point. Knutson should have been
better informed for his analysis. I also object to the inappro-
priate comment " As you read this do you get the impression they
were all going to end up at the bottom of the pit?" It was
snide and would have been better left out of the analysis.
To conclude I would like to propose alternatives in the pro-
duction of American Caving Accidents that would help the report
be more meaningful. Analyses should be constructed from first
hand accounts with interviews. They should lack assumptions,
