Acetylene Production
Cac2 + 2H,0 --> C2H2 + Ca(OH)2 ;AH298=-128 kJ Mole
An 82% commercial grade of Cac, (equivalent to 300 liters
C2H2 per kg) will give approximately 429 kcal of heat.
Since most of us (except for...ghast!!! electric cavers)
know about the process of making acetylene from carbide I will be
brief by covering two different acetylene production processes
from carbide; the wet process and the dry process.
Wet Process:
In the wet process "granular carbide is fed continụously
into excess water; and the slurry is agitated by gas evolution
and a mechanical generator. Generators of this type operate at
about 60-80°C and pressures at 15-30psi. The spent slurry is
continuously discharged as fresh carbide is added and acetylene
removed." (Tedeschi,7). The ratios of water to carbide may vary as
Payne states, "8:1 by weight"(33) while Tedeschi recommends "6:1
by weight."(7).
Most reaction generators are characterized by stirred water-
containing reactor chamber, carbide hopper, carbide feed (screw
hopper) device, acetylene water scrubber, and gas storage tank.
They are also equipped with flash arrestors to prevent vapor
explosions if the cooling of the reaction does not occur
properly.
Dry Process:
This represents the process cavers use in their acetylene
lamps. A large contained mass of calcium carbide is reacted with
water applied at a fixed rate. The gas is vented off and burned
at the lamp tip.
Commercially, however, this process varied. Equal parts by
weight of water and carbide are mixed and stirred. The gas is
still pulled off, but then it is stored for bottling or future
use. "The Prestolite Company, which controls United States
Patents" on the following process is one of only a few companies
still commercially producing and marketing carbide-based
