President's Column
Well folks, as I'm sure you already know if you're reading this issue, the club is
approaching the end of its 50th year of existence. Yep, while America was in the height of
World War II, the VPI Cave Club officially "went underground". Since that time, we've
come a long way, moving from bosun's chairs to ropewalkers, wool to nylon, and relationship
to relationship. In that time, VPI cavers have covered many strange and diverse territories;
from Giles County, to Lechugilla, to Mexico, to Oman, and to TRA and the NSS BOG. VPI
cavers have done a lot, and the fact that some cavers who graduated before many of the
current students were bom (no need to mention names) are still active members is a testament
to the long-standing camaraderie of our grotto.
So, what's the point? I don't know, but what else do you say when everything seems
to be going OK? This year, Blacksburg was chosen to host the '95 NSS Convention; we got
a place to practice vertical sessions again (thanks Buddy!) that is much closer to apr√©s vertical
session beer; VPI cavers were at four rescues (whew!!); two of our members became
landowners; a re-survey was started and several surveys were continued; a promising group of
new cavers showed up this fall; and last but not least, several people became members. (T11
bet you can't violate more rules of grammar in a single sentence!)
To all of you who have helped out in some way, shape, or form with the club this
year, I'd just like to say, "Thanks!". You have made my job as president very easy, and as
grad school tumed out to be 17,000,000 times harder than I thought it would be, I definitely
appreciate this.
However, I have two last things to say. The first deals with membership. I got the
impression that some trainees think you have to be an 'elite' caver to become a member, and
as I've noticed a relative decline in the number of new members over the past couple of years,
I certainly hope this is not one of the causes. Getting your membership, if you want it, is not
that hard. No, the club is not going to hand out memberships to just anyone who steps
underground, but you don't have to be ready to go surveying in Huatla to be a member. All
membership signifies is that you know what your doing in most situations underground, (and
that I can hassle you to do a lot more things for the club). Membership is merely a point in
a continual learning process, not an end. So, I hope to see more new members in '94.
The second thing deals with vertical sessions. Since we got the deck at the Ton-80,
the vertical sessions have become a place to merely learn how to rappel and climb on knots.
While these two things are essential, most of you know that they are merely the tip of the
iceberg when it comes to vertical work. I remember the bridge as a place where people used
to hang out and experiment with things like changeovers, crossing knots, rebelays, trying new
vertical rigs, and heel hangs. I spent many an hour myself hanging from the bridge, trying to
get un-stuck from some of my experiments. But the experiences were invaluable in
preventing me from making the same mistake in a real drop. Though the bridge was more
convenient than the Ton-80, we can make better use of the deck outside the Ton-80 than
we're currently doing. So, I hope to see more of you out Friday afternoons when the weather
warms up. Remember, our vertical sessions should not merely be places for members and
experienced trainees to just teach new people, they should be places for everyone to hang out,
relax, and possibly learn something.
Cave safely, and don't forget the beer at the end of the tunnel!
