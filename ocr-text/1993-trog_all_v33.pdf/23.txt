also.)
The subject of cave photography trips themselves is
also relevant. The best cave photography is done on trips
where that is the primary purpose of the trip. On a regular
cave trip, someone who stops to take pictures frequently
will slow the whole group down. Some people have less
patience for this than others, and so anything more
elaborate than just getting out a camera and doing a few
quick, uncomplicated shots (i.e. anything that requires time
to set up and help from other members of the trip) must be
agreed upon by those involved. This is not a problem on a
photography trip because everyone knows up front what is
going on. It can take an incredible amount of time to set
up some shots, and anyone who does it should be very
grateful to those who come along to help (definitely to
include giving them copies of the photos). It is also my
firm belief that a more elaborate cave photography trip
should be made only into a cave which you have been in
before and are familiar with, and preferably one that is
fairly easy to get into and out of (remember all the
equipment you will have to carry!).
Finally, there is one essential element of successful
cave photography which is also essential in any photography,
and that is composition and organization of the photo being
shot. That is something that calls upon the artistic
talents of the photographer. It needs a little time to be
planned, thought through, and visualized. Suggestions from
other participants on the trip can be helpful, as will as
having people along who know how to pose and look their best
in front of a camera. The photographer is ultimately
responsible for everything that gets into the photograph,
and practice and experience will increase one's skills
considerably over time.
