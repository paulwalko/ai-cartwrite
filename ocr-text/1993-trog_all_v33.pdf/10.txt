Heard it through the GRAPEVINE
Well, exam time is coming and it's time to buckle down, postpone caving trips, give up
Friday Speleo-seminars, and do some real studying - but only for you students! Ha ha. The
rest of us don't have to give up squat!
It's also time to reflect on what has transpired since the last Trog came out in ... wait.
When was the last issue? I can't remember that far back
So we'll just have to guess and go from there.
If you haven't figured it out by now, there are new officers in the club. If you don't
know who they are, forget it.
Banquet was a blast. The club celebrated the 50th anniversary of the VPI Grotto - the
very first student grotto and third oldest grotto. Everyone showed up in their Sunday best for
the festivities. R.E. Whittemore (membership #12!) spoke and gave a slide show of some of
the founding members of the club. He told stories about the partying and good times they
had. The more things change .... Betty Loyd, the club's first female president, was also
there to take a bow. Let's hear it for the ladies!
Dave C. fumbled through the awards, forgetting only a few of them in the trunk of his
car. Landowners were recognized, as was Ko, who received the A.I. Cartwright award.
Only slightly less prestigious was the Flameout award to Paul Hess. Now his parents
have something to brag about. Jim and Judy won some easy-on clothing to use in the event
of another one of those poorly timed leg injuries.
Kirk and Paul K. each won a grammy-cracker award for their guitar playing. Since
Paul was absent, his roomie Eileen, who was staying at Cecile's (foreshadowing), offered to
take his home. When she awoke the next morning, she found nothing but the wooden base
under the sofa. Apparently, gold spraypaint is Ronald Ann's favorite flavor.
The post-banquet party was filled with lots of dancing, drinking, sauna-ing, and other
craziness. Nat and Jeff almost burned a hole in the dance bam as they gyrated around the
floor. They were so close it was hard to tell where one stopped and the other started. Craig
kept the music playing and the bodies moving till the wee hours of the mom.
The fire attracted a lot of attention, but it was easy to tell who were new trainees and
who had been around awhile. It's all in what you wear - or don't wear. The stream was
freezing, but that didn't stop sauna junkies from taking the plunge.
The threat of layoffs at the arsenal had convinced a few folks to brave a retum to
school. Glen, Jim, and Craig were among those who found themselves students again.
Okay, which one will be voted Vice President in the next election?
Picnic was held in its usual place, though it wasn't quite the same without Buddy.
What was the same is that it rained, no poured, the majority of the weekend. Mother Nature
was kind enough to bring out the sunshine on Sunday, as everyone was packing up to leave.
Only three people were brave (or is it dumb?) enough to bike out. Butts and legs were
sore for Paul, Ko, and Dave C. To ease the trip, their road crew dutifully showed up with
water and snacks - unfortunately the bikers were already at the site.
