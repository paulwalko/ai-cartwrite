There will be a follow-up party at the Church of Rock & Roll on New Year's Eve. The
band has increased by two cavers, so come out and enjoy the tunes (but please, leave the
tomatoes and rotten eggs at home).
Will and Zina just discovered that they are pregnant (oops!). Their little bundle of joy is
due in July. Be sure not to mention to Will his recent water gain; he's really sensitive.

Sue Seltzer recently swore off caving. When word got out, discussions concerning
why were second only to arguments over who got her gear. After the fighting was over and
everyone had laid their claims, she changed her mind. Of all the nerve!
At about the same time, we learned that Doug and Sue are moving to Tennessee.
Doug plans to finish school and Sue plans to hang out until she has to either get a job or
starve. The good news (?) is that the club will see the dynamic duo more often, and now
there's a place to crash if you want to check out more than just the TAG caves of Tennessee.
Mate swapping is running rampant, as usual. We need a 'Who's Who in Caver
Relationships". Unfortunately, there's no point in mentioning who is dating whom - by the
time this comes to print, it will all have changed.
My sources tell me that the old farts haven't done anything noteworthy this past year,
so just make up your own gossip.
I guess that pretty much wraps up the news. We hope that everyone has a safe,
happy holiday and hope to see you all at the New Year's Bash.
