the bulb - use blue bulbs for color film, or put the
appropriate blue filter (#80C) on the camera lens, or a
blue-colored cover over the bulb.
I will point out, in regards to flash bulbs, that when
they were invented (late 20s - early 30s), the films
available were much less sensitive to light than films
available now. So, when you use the more powerful flash
bulbs with the much more sensitive film you can get now, you
can really get some spectacular results. However, as I have
mentioned, there is a limited, finite supply of them on the
planet (unless perhaps some cavers or someone else who needs
them badly enough buys up the leftover production equipment
from G.E. and Sylvania and goes back into business making
them). Therefore, one would probably not want to use them
up in situations which can be handled adequately with
electronic flashes.
Another piece of equipment that will inevitably be used
by the advanced cave photographer is the tripod. Although
it will take more time to set it up and carry it in and out
of the cave, it can make the picture-taking process much
easier while it is happening. This is especially true if
you are attempting a multiple-flash shots with assistants
firing their remote flashes manually; it is essential in any
situation where you will need to hold the shutter open and
have more than one flash fired without slave triggers, or
cover the lens while assistants move around to fire the
flashes at different parts of a cave on the same exposure. A
tripod also allows the photographer to use a cable release
and get far enough away from the camera that his breath will
not get in front of the lens and spoil the picture, in those
situations where it is possible to see your breath in the
cave.
A word about cameras is in order also. I mentioned
previously that it is not necessary to buy expensive cameras
to use in caves. The expensive automatic features on modern
cameras may be of some help, but by learning to use cameras
manually, anyone can do just as well with an old camera that
can be bought for under $50, as long as it has the manual
capabilities mentioned at the beginning of this article. I
have concluded recently that my best all-around cave camera
(for conventional print photographs) is an Agfa "Speedex",
which is probably at least 40 years old, and which I got at
a camera show for about $20.00. It folds up and can be
carried in your pocket (although I would advise using
something more rugged such as an army ammunition can). It
uses 120 roll film, which gives a negative that is 2 1/4
inches square more than 4 times the negative area of the
standard 35mm negative, and can give excellent sharpness in
8x10 enlargements, when using some of the 400-speed film
available in 120-size rolls. (This film must be bought at
camera stores. it is not usually available in such places as
K-Mart, etc. The price is usually around $4-5 for a 12-shot
roll. While this is considerably more expensive per shot
than 35mm film, the results can be considerably better
