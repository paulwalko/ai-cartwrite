acetylene. "Water is brought into reaction with calcium carbide
near the bottom of a cylindrical reaction chamber, provided with
an agitator rotated about a vertical axis. The acetylene and
powdered calcium hydroxide rise to the top of the cylinder, and
in one modification the powdered hydroxide, which overflows the
top of the cylinder fills an annular seal similar to a liquid
seal."(Nieuwland, 12).
Any prospects for a carbide lamp?? The dry process also
releases approximately 475 cal per gram of pure carbide. Assuming
that there are 50 grams of carbide in a typical lamp that means
approximately 23,750 cal are released in the form of heat, of
course cavers. never have any luck because we don't burn pure
carbide. The carbide we use is 85-90% pure but that still leaves
us with 19,000-20,000 cal of tummy warming heat. Nice if we could
conserve it all for those long waits at a vertical drop.
Conclusion
Now you should have a general but competent knowledge about
the history and production of those little grayish-black rocks
you put in your lamp every weekend and the hydrolysis of
acetylene that takes place. There are many reasons for the
decline in carbide such as cleaner acetylenes, high cost of
handling the large quantities of raw materials for carbide, new
energy sources, and aging technology. Technology has advanced the
generations that depended on carbide-based acetylenes cavers are
a majority of the few who still depend on carbide. It may be
possible, not that I know, that carbide may be a thing of the
past. The last can of carbide ever produced may be the half-empty
one at Sign-out right now. Tomorrow we will all be electric run
off rechargeables and waiting for the day when Premier debuts
it's" Model 2000 Nuko-Drive" Nuclear powered lamp. The cavers will
always be here with or without carbide. What will our next source
of light be?
