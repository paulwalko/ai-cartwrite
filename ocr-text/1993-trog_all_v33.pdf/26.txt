Step 2: Calcium Oxide Production (Cao)
Calcium oxide is prepared by calcining limestone, or
hydrated lime. The hydrated lime (spent carbide in caver jargon)
can also come from acetylene generators. Generally, carbide
production facilities have prepared calcium oxide (quick lime) by
decomposing or "burning" a 98% calcium carbonate (CaCO3) to Cao
and CO2. To prepare a satisfactory grade of carbide, the purity
of the Cacoz and Cao must be 99%. Magnesium oxide impurity in the
Cao is very undesirable since it increases both carbon and
electrical power usage in the process.
"The lime component" of calcium oxide production process "is
usually quicklime with a grain size of up to 50mm. The Mgo
content should be <1.5% and the total cao content should be
higher than 90%."(Payne, 40).
A typical lime is:
Cao > 90%
MgO > 1.5%
CO2 < 2.5%
P205 < 0.02%
In the 1940's-1960's the hydrated lime [Ca (OH)) resulting
from large scale carbide-to-water acetylene generators was dumped
in large lime ponds or impounds. In the 1950's many plants were
recycling and buying this by-product to manufacture carbide.
"Up to 60% of the calcium hydroxide which forms when acetylene is
prepared from carbide can be returned into the carbide furnace."
(Payne, 40). Today there is no recycling mainly due to the fact
that only two companies in the world today still using carbide to
manufacture commercial grade acetylene. Some other uses of the
hydrated lime are in waste water treatment plants, soil
neutralizers, and sand lime bricks. (Tedeschi,9).

Step 3: The Carbide Furnace (An Overview)
The carbide furnace has been used since the beginning of the
carbide industry. " The main features of the low shaft furnace
are the furnace vessel, the electrodes for the supply of
electrical energy, and the feeds for the introduction of the raw
materials. (See diagram CAR-2).
The furnace vessel is made of welded iron and reinforced
against distortions. The vessel is lined with carbon or
refractory bricks, and has up to three tap-holes which are
arranged above the bottom of the lining and through which liquid
carbide flows into cast-iron crucibles. The zones around the tap-
holes have stronger linings and are usually provided with water
