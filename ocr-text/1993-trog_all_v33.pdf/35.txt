make good decisions. Second, don't make a bad situation worse by pushing limits (i.e. stuck in a room
vs. stuck in a pinch). You can stay in control of a situation keeping a steady pace, maintaining wide
margins for error, and not leaving things to chance (chance is for desperate situations). Finally, keep
egos in check. This goes along with the concept of teamwork. In a stressful situation the most
experienced can make mistakes, and beginners can offer valuable inputs. Don't be so sure of yourself
that you flatly disregard someone's opinion.
Diversity of technique is something that did not influence this trip, but is equally important in
preventing accidents. A number of cavers seem very restricted in the techniques they choose to learn
and use. Either they'll know just enough to get by, or they’re convinced that their particular methods
are always the best. Both of these attitudes jeopardize safety. There are two important reasons for
learning multiple techniques. First, no method is valid for every situation, or you may be limited by
suitability or amount of gear. Second, you will be able to objectively evaluate methods or rigs that are
foreign to your experience. Sometimes newly developed methods are better. Many times discrepancies
in style are only matters of semantics or better vs. best, but not safety. Learn to tell the difference.
Safe caving means being adaptive, and your adaptiveness is greatly enhanced by knowing different
techniques. It doesn't mean you can't have a preferred method, or that everyone must be a supercaver.
It is simply prudent to know as much as you can. Failure to continually broaden your skills only
limits your ability to deal with unfamiliar situations.
