The chosen weekend coincided with Easter weekend, so the Beer Hunt took place at
the picnic site. Participation was not up to usual standards, to the chagrin of the kids. So if
you waited just long enough and then asked nicely, one of the Zoe kids would walk you to a
hidden beer and point it out.
Cavers worked hard (did I just write that?) all afternoon on Saturday, clearing a lot of
brush from the hillside. It was added to the fire, along with a groundhog caught by Pyro and
Barb's dog.
Hoss turned out a great pig/venison roast (no one felt like plucking the groundhog),
everyone ate heartily, there was singing 'round the campfire, and even "The Great
Marshmallow Battle of '93". Everyone had fun (except for Philip, who complained the whole
time).
Old signout on Eakin Street was bustling this summer when Ronald Ann had eight
puppies. How did all those doggies fit inside? Mom was grumpy and the kids were noisy, but
it sure was fun watching those little spotted things running around the lawn (I can say this
because I wasn't living there!). Cecile managed to sell off all the puppies and Ronald Ann
finally got to rest. She's now back to being a puppy herself.
Speaking of signout, it moved to Apartment Heights, which is becoming a caver
community once again. Signout is now hosted by Dave and Dave. Yes, the Dave club is still
going strong, and now the Al(l)isons and Jens are taking over. If you see a couple of old
farts, just call them Ed & Lynn.
Kim threw a birthday party/pig roast in July to celebrate Dave being older than the hills.
There was lots of great food and a keg. Dave W. and some others spent the day pretending
they were expert volleyball players, but the rest of us weren't fooled. Professional volleyball
has fewer beer breaks. Blacksburg's finest paid a special visit that night in surprisingly low
numbers (the formula goes something like this: one fender bender = nine squad cars with
lights flashing). Doug greeted them with his most courteous "Zeig Heil", but the cops, looking
for an argument, broke up the party (after all, these guys have to have some fun).
Russ and Sandy hosted the annual party at their home on the waters of the
Â· Chesapeake. It was a good weekend to canoe or just sit on the back porch and chat.
The weather was great, and the skeeters and no-see-ums kept their distance. Those
foolish enough to trust Buckwheat's sense of time ("It'll only be about five hours on the water'')
were treated to a full day of sailing on his parents' boat. Despite the captain's best efforts, no
one fell into the water. The boat sailed swiftly on toward the dock. Nine hours later, it was
time to drive the lobster-red passengers back to Russ and Sandy's place. If only Buckwheat
and Lynn hadn't left the car headlights on -- all weekend.
This was a busy summer for cave injuries. VPI cavers were involved in four rescues
this summer; in Crossroads, Organ Cave, Porters, and Scott Hollow. Doug even got himself a
"hero shot" on the evening news. How much do you think he paid for that?
Well, Maurya finally suckered Kevin into buying her a diamond. All the bachelors of
the world are disappointed now that the flirting will come to an end ... or will it? She wasn't
the only one with a ring, however. Patty was flashing her own from Brian at OTR. Okay,
ladies, whose is bigger? (1 mean the ring!).
