I have been a regular follower of the NSS publication "Amer-

it has much to offer in the education of cavers on better ways
of handling crisis, and techniques that may prove inappropriate
for these situations. However, I feel I need to take issue with
several problems that revolve around the editor Steve Knutson.
These problems affect the report's objectivity, credibility, and
usefulness to the general caving community.
I hope Knutson is in some way qualified to analyze the tech-
nical and psychological nature of accidents as he never presents
his credentials. He seems to betray a lot of personal biases
and opinions for the guru he is supposed to be. A person (what
should be a group) acting in his position should be an objective
observer and educator. Rarely does Knutson offer truly con-
structive criticisms that offer practical methods of prevention.
Instead, he condemns using pious analyses with all the benefits
of hindsight, and operating in an environment without stress or
time constraints. I find it odd he can write so confidently
while using conjecture, or second and third hand sources. Even
then I've seen him leave out important facts that change the
whole nature of an accident. Still, it would be unfair of me to
bring up all these criticisms without citing specific examples
from " American Caving Accidents, 1991."
I would first like to cite Knutson's article "Be Warned; the

apparent lack of knowledge regarding the behavior and character-
