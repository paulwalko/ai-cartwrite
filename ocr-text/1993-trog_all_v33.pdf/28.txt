"Above the furnace there are several hoppers from which the
furnace vessel is continuously fed with the pre-mixed raw
material via pipes. During the operation the carbide melt present
in the furnace must remain covered with raw material."(Payne, 38).
During the reaction approximately 400m of gas is formed per
ton of carbide. To recover this gas the furnace is provided with
the appropriate equipment:
1. Open furnace - The gas ascends through the raw material
and burns off at the surface.
2. Covered furnace - Up to 80% of gas is retained. Co and
CO2 are collected separately and purified under a different
method for each gas;
a. Dry process - Gas is pulled through ceramic filters.
b. Wet process – Disintegrators or Venturi Washers are
used.
3. closed furnace - All gas is collected and used for
further chemical processes.
Step 4: The Carbide Furnace (Operation)
"Before the furnace is put into operation it is charged with
part of the coke to be used, the lower ends of the three hollow
electrode cylinders are welded closed, and the cylinders are
filled with electrode mass and brought into contact- with the coke
present in the furnace.
The furnace is operated initially at a very low voltage and
low intensity of current and is slowly run up until its nominal
capacity is reached, which, depending on the nature of the
materials, will take 4-8 days in the case of a 55MN furnace.
When the furnace is in operation, the melt contained in the
vessel has to be constantly covered with raw materials," which
have been dried, broken, and screened, "and the electrodes dip
about 50-150cm into this material."(Payne, 39). As the electrode
ends burn away they are constantly (periodically) reset into the
mass. The mass must be constantly covered to conserve reaction
mass and continue the process. The rate of calcium carbide
production is proportional to the area of contact between quick
lime and coke." (Tedeschi,6).
The voltage applied to the electrodes is in the range of
100-300V while the current has an intensity of up to 150,000A.
The electric arc creates an energy that initiates the reaction
process around 1500-2000°C. (Tedeschi,6). This point also
represents "the melting point of the eutectic between calcium
oxide and calcium carbide and takes place between the molten
material and the suspended solid particles of carbon.
When the reaction has progressed to the point that calcium
carbide forms over 70% of the total fused material the melting
point rises towards that of pure calcium carbide; 2300°c.
(See Diagram CAR-3). However, as the melting point rises towards
