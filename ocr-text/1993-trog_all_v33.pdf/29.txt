2300째C the decomposition of carbide to calcium and carbon begins
and the energy consumed in maintaining the higher temperature
increases costs. As a result the product is usually 70% to more
than 90% calcium carbide." (Nieuwland ,9).
"Because of the high temperatures and the strongly reducing
conditions prevailing in the carbide furnace, these impurities
cause a number of energy consuming secondary reaction to take
place. Whilst H2O and CO2 are expelled at temperatures of less
than 1000째c, the other impurities maintained above get into the
carbide melt, whilst Al2O3 and Sio, are in part dissolved to form
aluminate and silicate and in part reduced. The resulting silicon
reacts with the reduced Fe,o, to form an Fe/Si alloy; which is an
undesirable by-product in the manufacture of carbide. Most of the
Mgo is reduced and, in the cooler zones of the furnace, part of
the magnesium vapour (sic) is oxidized by co, so that Mgo is
again formed."(Payne, 35).
To obtain the liquid carbide the tap-holes are opened
electrically at regular intervals and the carbide flows into cast
iron crucibles. To close the tap-holes cold, granular carbide is
cast into the stream of liquid carbide which then quickly
solidifies," (Payne, 40) into granules or ingots.
