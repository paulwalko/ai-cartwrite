Caver Motel: by Starnes
On of the great aims of almost any caver is to find and push virgin cave. My goal was to finally do
this before I graduated. I have never been afforded this opportunity in my five years in
the club mainly because of problems with school, and missed chances. I've been on digs before, but
none of those ever panned out. I also see points on topo maps that make my mouth water, but never
had the time to dutifully follow up. That is up until this semester when Starnes presented me the
chance with a little extra, because one of the other milestones in a caver's career is getting stuck. This
story is more than a good caving anecdote. I hope that persons who have not yet had their own little
crisis underground will find a lesson in the advantages of keeping a clear head (calm or not), working
together, and knowing your abilities.
This spring Steve Wells invited Dave Warren and me on a dig and some surveying in Starnes, plus
a chance for some virgin cave. The dig had potential if we could sledge one rock out of the way. The
survey was just to tidy up a little stream section he had found as a result of a ladder climb less than a
year before. We were going to be back by midnight (we still did), but not until we finished our second,
unscheduled sledging where I got "delayed due to incompatible proportionment."
We decided to spend a little time at this promising site before we exited the cave. Steve and Leroy
had long had their eyes on three pinches which led into an obviously larger room. When you shouted
through the crack you could hear the room echo, and the trickle of water. The first pinch was high,
came in from the left, and quite impossible. The second was a straight-forward climb up to a pinch
into the bottom where the water exited the room. It was occupied by two bulges of rock which Leroy
had tried to get past several times before. The third was the most promising from a present size
standpoint, but would involve some unusual twists of the body. This is where the sledging effort began.
Steve and Chummer began to pound the rock while I poked around elsewhere. About a half hour later
Steve was calling to me asking if I'd like to try a little virgin cave. When I got to the dig Steve had
made it through, but Chummer was too big. I was the smallest on the trip; so there was little doubt I
wouldn't fit through. I crawled up the tight and muddy 45 degree slope to the pinch. To enter it I
had to lie on my right-hip, and work my back over a small bulge resulting in a piked position. From
this point Steve explained that the trick was to get my hips level with my shoulders and push past
another protrusion that ran along the sternum. My first attempt failed because I couldn't kick my hips
high enough up into the pinch. I had expressed some concern that if I wouldn't be able to back out if I
made it far enough in the wrong orientation. I decided to try one more time with a little coaxing from
Steve. In my second try I kicked my way with some ease to the sternum pinch. I relaxed a little,
pushed, and felt the rock ride along and past my sternum. "Hmm..." I thought in the back of my
head, but I was in virgin cave.
The well we had broken into was about eight feet in diameter, and had a pool at one end with
