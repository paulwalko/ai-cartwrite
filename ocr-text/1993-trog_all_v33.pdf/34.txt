gypsum formations. A ten foot climb was the source of water entering this room. Steve and I climbed
up to an peanut-shaped well with chert walls. I tested holds closer to the 20 foot waterfall which
proved to be rotten. Steve chimneyed the narrow part and saw that there was passage beyond. Since
we had no desire to scoop and were tired from the first dig we decided to leave it. Besides Chummer
couldn't fit. I have never been blessed with the kind of size that lets people like Ko or Leroy go
through almost anything. Last time I tried to do the one foot, both arms through the hanger bit I
drew blood shortly before the hanger busted open. My one advantage in pinches is the fact that my
hips will go through anything my chest will, and my chest anything my hips will. I'm also good at
tricking my body through some spots.
We went back to the pinch. Steve was confident he would fit and knew I was concerned so I tried
first. I had to climb above the crack, and lower myself onto the high/" wide‚Äù part. There was no
support for the legs. I slid feet first to the sternum pinch which I could not get past. Where my
sternum had acted as a runner before, it was now a ratchet. I also had kicked to keep my hips high
before, and now had no means to support them. At this point I became very displeased, and crawled
back to Steve. I tried four more times including headfirst, but because the floor dropped away at 45
degrees I could not support myself. My last try I became briefly stuck, but managed to kick myself
loose and back to Steve.
Needless to say I was quite freaked on adrenaline after the last try (my hand was shaking a good
two inches back and forth when I held it out). Steve still thought I could make it, but I refused to
enter that pinch again. In this room I was happy. I had food, clothes, water, and at least 10 charges
for my lamp. I did not want to make a slightly uncool situation gravely worse by getting stuck where
these items would no longer be available, and digging would cease to be an option.
We agreed the best option would be to exit through the second pinch where the water left the room.
Leroy had tried this one many times because it was a straight-forward big on both sides pinch. I was
adamant about not risking getting stuck in a way that they could no longer help, and outside
assistance would be required. All that meant was we'd have to make it big enough so I wouldn't need
to force myself through. After almost two hours of hammering, and many attempts I was finally able
to slide through the hole. Steve came shortly after with a few yanks from Chummer. After we ate,
and I got my nerves back together; we left with a hole in place plenty big for the survey trip the next
week.
Analysis:
This trip is a good example of maintaining control to prevent a potential accident from manifesting
itself. There were three key points which kept a call out from being necessary. First and foremost was
communication. Everyone expressed their opinions and concerns so we could identify hazards and
