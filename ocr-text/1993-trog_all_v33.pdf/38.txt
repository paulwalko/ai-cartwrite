The VPI Cave Club: A Perspective
What is the cave club? Who am I? Who have we become? These questions come to mind when I
think about myself in relation to the club.
It is a group of people from many different personality types, drawn by a common lovė of cavers
and caving. This, I think, is a pretty good assessment and does mirror, to some extent, one statement
in our new constitution. But there was more for me. This group seemed and is very self-aware. People
here are at ease being themselves. It was that aspect, I believe, which really bated me. Perhaps because
I was a much different person back in the fall quarter of 1987.
Still suffering from the influences of my parents, I was beginning to grow and change as an
individual. The open-mindedness, the strong friendships, the support, and of course the caving drew my
interest. I guess I felt that this was the group to help me find out who I was.
Early on, though, my quiet nature kept me from probably the best aspect of the club, its parties. At
the same time this group was the prior mentioned things to me, it also seemed to scare me some. It
seemed wild and scary and I wasn't quite sure if I was ready for it. I didn't think I would fit in. But I
eventually jumped in, and began to experience the club.
It was something new. From a distance it was tempting to lump people into stereotypes. He's a
gearhead, she's a flirt. Look at those two, they must be sex fiends (and perhaps they were). But up
close, you were forced to see who these people were and breakdown those stereotypes. They were just
different. They were who they wanted to be, not trying to prove anything or impress anyone. Perhaps
this is why the club has not always thought highly of Greek organizations. Frats and sororities are
typically very surfacy groups of people who get together to get some idea of self identity. However,
more often than not, these same people often leave the organization no better aware of themselves than
when they first joined.
A sauna party was one of my first few parties. Talk about initiation by fire. At the time it seemed
so wild and crazy. So much of what went on seemed to buck with my own narrow-minded morals and
beliefs. But then, after hanging around with this group for a while, I began to rethink things. This was
a group of people who were what they wanted to be. They seemed to do whatever they felt like, and
didn't worry about what anyone else thought. And cavers, being who they were, didn't care what
anyone else did. They just wanted to have a good time.
So now who have I become? I am much more aware of who I am and what I want in life. I now
value open-mindedness very highly. An old friend from back home commented on how much I have
changed in the last several years. He said, "A change for the better”. He referred to the way I looked at
life and reacted to situations. I attribute a good deal of that to the club.
I am proud to be a VPI Cave Club member and part of its somewhat strange social structure. I am
also proud of my training as a caver by the club. I believe that our training program has started many
