istics of at least two devices: the carabiner break bar, and the
figure-8. The carabiner break bar setups have been long out-
dated for two important reasons involving the gate. First, the
unnatural load applied to the carabiner gate by weighting it
laterally. Second, the danger of a gate being forced open due
to accidental contact with a lip is too great which was the main
reason for its going out years ago. Knutson has made a severe
mistake by endorsing (by mere mention) an outdated device as an
alternative to the figure-8.
Knutson argues that the eight should be banned because many
rescue groups have banned its use, and that it causes permanent
kinks in the rope. I can understand why rescue groups would
move away from the figure-8. The rack is simply more adept at
handling the loads and moments placed on it in rescue situa-
tions. The twist the figure-8 puts in the rope does cause the
load it suspends to spin. This is something you don't want to
do with a stokes, but the demands placed on the figure-8 during
a rappel are entirely less demanding. Some simple safety pre-
cautions can still be used: don't use one if you weigh more than
150 pounds, and don't use one on drops much over 100 feet. In
regards to the damage to the rope caused by the figure-8, I
think the rope manufacturer would be the best judge of the
severity or importance.
Knutson's biases are displayed in his objections to the use
of bottom belays. He completely disregards the multitude of
examples where it did or could have saved someone from injury or
death. According to the "American Caving Accidents, 1991"
report an accident occurred where a woman suffered a broken foot
and ankle, dislocated toes, three fractured vertebrae, and
bruised ribs and sternum after a 100 foot uncontrolled unbelayed
rappel (May 12, pg 355). In the same issue a man was spared
serious injury by a belay after a 110 foot uncontrolled rappel
(Dec. 28, pg 354). Knutson goes on to criticize the use of bot-
tom belays saying, "I think a caver who requests a bottom belay
should not go down, but should exit the cave and get his/her
techniques in order."
