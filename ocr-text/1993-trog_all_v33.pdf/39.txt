cavers on the road to becoming some of the best cavers around. But I also realize that this thinking can
lead to one looking down on anyone who has not gone through our training program and that is the
wrong way to look at things. All said and done I am glad to have spent many hours underground with
VPI Cavers.
When you spend tons of hours underground with people whom your life can depend on, strong,
trusting, and life-long friendships can develop. This, I think, is where the peculiarities of the social
structure of the club originate. Even though things aren't always great between two people, in the end
when the stakes are high, your fellow caver will come through.
Someone once compared the club to a big family with a lot of incest going on. This humorous
analogy is accurate to an extent because there is the occasional mate swapping thing going on. Another
caver added the word 'dysfunctional to family. This I think really finishes the description of our club.
Rifts do form and tensions get high, but deep down, I think we are all aware of the things that bind us
together.
So now, like several people, I sort of view the club as a surrogate family. So yea, sometimes I try
and meddle too much when I see rifts forming, or things going amiss. And although it is hard to watch
things go bad in such a tight knit group, I am learning more to let things go their own course. In a
dysfunctional family things don't always work out for the best, unless people try really hard. But even
then trying hard is no guarantee. However, some things irk me beyond control. When the club as a
whole is attacked, I have a hard time backing down and letting things run their course. After all, who
likes to see their friends jerker around?
So this jumbled mess of words is what the VPI Cave Club and all those associated with it means to
me. So you might think that I need to get a life. Well actually I am quite content with it as it is. I like
Blacksburg, and I care about my friends. I think I will be around for many years to come. And yet I
know I am still growing and changing. And I can't think of a better group of people to do that with
than the Cave Club.
