The Manufacture of Calcium Carbide
To The
Manufacture of Acetylene
(In Case Your Ever On "Jeopordy")
By Adam C. Hungerford
"Calcium Carbide has become the most important
discovery with regard to the industrial chemistry of
this century." (Payne, 32). NOT TO MENTON CAVERS
A Brief Overview Of Historical Development
"In the early 1860's Hare and Deville first formed calcium
carbide by heating lime with carbon."(Nieuwland, 7). Any use of
carbide was virtually unknown at this time. In 1862, Wohler found
a way to prepare carbide from carbon and a zinc-calcium alloy,
and also recognized the nature of the carbide compound and was
the first to identify acetylene as the gaseous product of its
hydrolysis. Nieuwland also went on to state that "in 1893 Willson
was granted a United States patent for the production of calcium
carbide from lime and coke in an electric furnace using the
equation CaO + 3C--> Cac2 + CO. (7). Commercialization of carbide
production began soon after. The production of calcium carbide,
requiring very high temperatures, increased demand for
electricity and as a result the number of hydroelectric plants
grew as well as the industrial centers around them. The early
Twentieth Century saw an increased demand in carbide for its use
as an illuminant and in early oxy-acetylene welding.
In the 1920's-1950's Carbide production was at it's high
point. "It was the most economic and safe method of handling and
shipping acetylene, " (Tedeschi,3) and still is today.
Technological advances in carbide production were bringing more
demand to the coal producers for their by-products. Equipment
using acetylene for illumination reached climatic levels. This
era also marked the beginning of bottled acetylene for lighting,
heating, and cooking. Never again after this time period would
calcium carbide be used for so much. "1962-1965 saw the world's
highest production of carbide, "(Payne, 42) but that was not to
last.
The Decline of Calcium Carbide
Many factors led to the decline of calcium carbide's short-
lived fame. The U.S. economy in the 1960's was dependent on the
rapidly evolving technology industries. Coal was a fuel of the
early Nineteenth century. As methods of producing carbide
improved, unfortunately, the costs of production increased. One
of the most influential causes in this increase was the
increasing cost of electricity. The huge electrical demand of the
carbide furnaces was expensive and wasted too much energy for the
furnaces to remain cost effective.
As the demand for acetylene increased new methods developed
for acetylene production such as petro-chemical processes.
Methane also developed as an alternative to acetylene. The
