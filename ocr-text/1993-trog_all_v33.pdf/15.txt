down to point out a ledge that defines where
the straddle pit ends. Due to their highly
attuned concentration, this detour confused of
few of the rappellers. Tentatively, they
speculated whether or not they were supposed
to get off rope at this ledge. If so, how? It was
five feet away. Fortunately advice was sought.
Four trainees in a row asked where they were
supposed to go while on rope. Joe Zo and I in
our infinite wisdom replied, "Down!"
Several of us already down decided to
cave locally to prevent hypothermia while the
others came down. The Devil's Staircase was in
our midst. Everyone was pumped. Angie and I
with Stephanie and Eileen on our heals
stealthy made our way up, with occasional
coaching from Joe Zo for direction. We learned
about loose break down piles and slippery
slopes. On occasion, we met up with the other
five people on our trip. Who knew Kevin and
Jonathan were quietly caving behind us? Carol
enjoyed seeing the cascade of light down the
Staircase created by nine headlamps.
At last, the climb that most of us knew
was coming. The dreaded Coat hanger and the
b-tard of a climb after it loomed. Having only
been dragged up the Coat hanger by belay line,
my caving-self-esteem has never been charged
by this piece of Staircase. The natural
foothold is just not high enough for me to
utilize the spot for my knee. I tried other
ways while waiting for the others. Lay backs,
toe jambs, full pull-ups, nada. The pile of
rocks was my last resort to do this on my own,
and I did it. Everyone made the climb on their
own. Because some of us didn't do the climb
the same way, doesn't make the other ways less
respectful. Some of us need belays, some of us
need full rigs, and some of us need nothing at
all to make a climb. Cave accordingly.
The next climb everyone usually can do
on their own but half usually injure
themselves. A few of us were a tad over
zealous pulling ourselves over the sharp lip.
Bruised ribs and near castrations ensued. We
regrouped and had a snack. As sign-in time
neared, we quickly pursued the entrance. The
trip reversed, and riggers were in the rear.
Carol was our own pied piper leading us to the
entrance by the sound of her voice.
Finally, the trip was completed. The
night sky was beautiful. Orion raised out of
the southeast horizon. We sat in the field on a
warm, autumn night consuming brie, breakfast
bars, and beer. A sort of graduation was held
in the midst of all the verbal pats-on-the-
back. Lessons were learned, fears were
conquered; and time was well spent. It was
difficult to start the long drive home.
