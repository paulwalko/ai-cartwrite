ADVANCED CAVE PHOTOGRAPHY
By Edwin Clements
Those of us who love caving have a wide variety of
reasons for doing so. Probably one of the most common is
the incredibly beautiful scenery in some of them. It is
inevitable that we attempt to take photos in them, for our
own enjoyment as well as to share the underground beauty
with our friends. The purpose of this article is to share
some information that will help those who want to create
cave photos that are a little more dramatic, artistic, and
memorable than average.
Most people who start off taking pictures in caves
carry the small, simple, inexpensive instamatic or
automatic-type pocket cameras. I used them myself many
times on my early cave trips, and certainly enjoyed the
results. However, their capabilities are limited, and
anyone who is interested in doing more elaborate photography
will need to have a camera with the standard manual
adjustments (shutter speed including "B" settings, F-stop,
focusing, and a flash connector), and also be knowledgable
about flash guide numbers, film speeds, composition, and
depth of field. This information is taught in basic
photography courses available from a variety of sources, and
an explanation of it is not being attempted here. However,
the good news is that it is not necessary to spend
extravagant amounts of money to acquire this equipment.
There are plenty of good, moderately priced, used cameras
that can do just fine, and not create the risk of losing or
damaging expensive items in the rugged environment which we
have to deal with inside of caves. (There is an old saying
that anything you carry into a cave should be considered
expendable. I have had some experiences of my own which
verify that.)
The starting point of any photograph is lighting. In
caves, the name of the game is flashes, and correct use of
them can add greatly to the results you can get. Trick
number one is have the flash off of the camera if possible.
This prevents it from reflecting directly back into the
camera lens (impossible to avoid when using cameras with the
flash built in right next to the lens), and thereby creates
a much prettier effect. The best general-use position is
about a 45-degree angle between the line from the flash to
the subject, and the line from the camera to the subject.
Other flash positions can be tried and experimented with.
External flashes can be attached by flash extension cords,
fired by "slave" flash triggers, or can be fired manually by
a helper after setting up the shot, having everyone turn off
their helmet lights, and then holding the camera shutter
open with the "bulb" setting. The general rules for flash
guide numbers applies when aiming the flash at an angle;.
