Vice President's column
Well, it has been a successful year so far, hopefully the
remainder of my term will go at least as well as the first part.
During my term we have added four new members, and I expect to see at
least four more new members before Spring Break. Although bridge
privileges have been taken from us, we have had rappelling sessions
at Ton-80 every Friday afternoon from 3:00 to 5:00. I've been to
each session and attendance is minimal; I need both members and
trainees if any teaching/learning is to take place. It would be nice
if we could use the quarry at Jim's more often - something to think
about next semester at any rate.
A good number of trainee trips have been taken this semester,
however more are needed and I can't always do it. As we all know, I
am fond of those week day trips but perhaps some other members could
fill in for me. The practice rescue was a success - Scott survived
(matter of opinion ed. note). My only complaint is that the
after-meeting-speleo-seminars are lame - are all you guys at the
Friday AA meeting or what?
