To climb rock-pile or not to climb rock-pile,
-- that is the question:-
Whether 'tis nobler in the cave to suffer
The hypothermia of outrageous expectation,
Or to take footholds against a sea of testosterone,
And by opposing end them?
To climb,--to fall, 5
No way; and by falling we cause rescue
The body-ache and a thousand natural cuts
That flesh is heir to,-'tis a laceration
Devoutly to be missed.
To climb,--to fall,-
To fall! perchance to die:--ay, there's the tub; . 10
When we have conquered this frippery,
Must give us pause: there's the respect
That is meaningless in technique
For whom shall bear the taunts and the stigma of
The oppressors’ vanity, the troglodyte's comunand, 15
The jabs of laziness, tacit agreements,
The insolence of experience, and the spurns
That impatient attitudes of the “worthy” takes,
When they themselves have questionable form
With a bare bodkin? who would the cave gods ordain, 20
To grunt and sweat on weary descent,
But that dread of contradiction while traversing,-
The multifariousness of an ascent, from which differing
Approaches may suffice,--puzzles the will,
And confuses what is appropriate for said climber,
With what is effective for others we know not of.
Thus honor makes patients of us all;
25
And thus the desire for resolution
Is crippled by the politics of skill
And relinquishes the core of the matter,
With this regard, safety is forgotten,
And lost in the name of honor.
