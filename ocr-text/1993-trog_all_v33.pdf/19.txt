out to be much more difficult in the uphill direction. Joe, the
last one through, after several failed attempts had to be pulled
out. Back at the bottom of the climb it was decided that the
only thing left to do was leave the way we came in.
Only forty feet back from the where we had climbed into the
ceiling I noticed a passage we had not seen on the way in. It
looked tight, but anything would have to be better than crawling
all the way back. Boy, was I wrong! Amy looked at the opening
and dove right in, since I had found the passage I jumped right
in after her. After about ten feet things got bad, the floor
turned to muddy water and the walls closed in. About sixty feet
down the passage we were on our sides laying in the mud and
unable to move our heads. Above us we could see that the ceiling
went up another five feet, but protruding rock ledges prevented
us from sitting or standing up. Up to this point we could still
see lights at the start of the crawl, but now the passage turned
left and started into an s crawl. As I turned left my head hit
the wall for the hundredth time and my lamp fell out for the
second time. With the striker now wet my lamp would not relight.
Amy some how turned herself around and reached back with her lamp
in hand. Her lamp was going out again and as her little blue
flame lit my light, hers went out. Beyond the s crawl the
passage opened up to our relief, only to shrink down worse than
before. Shouts from behind inquired whether the passage went or
not. With one light out and I not wanting to crawl any more I
yelled back, "No! We're coming back!" Once out Amy and I were
wet to the bone and covered in mud.
Having no where else to go, we sadly gave up trying to find
the loop. Cold and wet we continued out the way we came in,
until Leroy spotted another passage we had missed before. As I
pulled up the rear all I could hear was Leroy saying, "It's huge
the cable ladder has to be around here somewhere. As long as
there was no crawling to do I didn't care where it went and I
soon joined them in the room. Then from the other side of the
room Leroy says he's found the ladder, but the wrong end, we were
at the top of the cable ladder again! With Amy and I soaked we
marched back through Whisper Hollow for the third time. Stopping
for a break on the park bench we tried to decide where we had
taken the wrong turn. As we exited the cave we found yet another
surprise, about one inch of snow on the ground and it was still
falling! Back at the van we all changed a little quicker than
usual, and sat down to a nice cold old Milwaukee beer courtesy of
Joe.
