Like Any Other Day in Newberries
One extremely warm day in mid-
November, ten cavers mistakenly decided to go
underground. It was sunny and seventy
degrees Fahrenheit. What were we thinking? I
could go into the psychological aspects of
spelunkers, but I will leave that to the experts.
Not to mention, the copying bill for such an
endeavor would be astronomical.
Anyway, while enjoying time spent
with the landowners, it was noticed that the
trainees were getting restless. “Why am I
awake?" "I should be studying for Genetics."
"You know we could go hiking. The A.T. is just
over there.” “So, you want to move in
together?” “Sun is cool.....eh, eh.” “Where'd
the Zo's put their beer. One shouldn't drink
and cave, right?" Right, but no trainee
reasoning could stop these adventurers from
doing the right thing. Cave like we have never
caved before.
After checking out a new sinkhole, we
drove to the cave. Mike3 managed to take a
chunk out of his gas tank on various hidden
rocks in the field. “Jeezus Criis!” Now that
Mike3 was typically distressed with other
things, the rest of us were jovial and prepared
for the trip down. To our amazement, more
experienced cavers were ready before most of
the less experienced cavers. This is a first in
my memory. Maybe the plague of ladybugs
caused such efficiency.
The rigging crew proceeded to the
entrance. As my confidence in rigging began
to slip away, it was decided after much
discussion that Carol was capable of belaying
without being tied-in. Time was wasting, and
people were hot Having only rappelled the
entrance or never being in this cave, many of
us hoped the butterflies in our stomachs would
somehow help us to float down that dark hole.
Sewing machine leg didn't help a few of us
either, but we all did it practically unscathed.
By having plenty of experienced people
on the trip, the rigging crew could proceed
safely to rig the Nuisance Drop and Bill's
Rappel. This was my first cable ladder rig. I
studied the previous night and made inquiries
as to ideal situations. Through discussion
with Joe Zo about this contraption, it was clear
that I could rig safely, but timeliness and
efficiency was lacking a bit. What's new with
inexperienced riggers. As it was prophesied,
Carol questioned my bomb-proof ropework. It
apparently wasn't convenient for her. “Joseph!
I haven't seen this type of rig for 15 years!”
(This is probably a misquote, but she showed
her age successfully.) The rigging crew
decided that she should be more flexible and
stop wining. It was also decided that I should
be the first one down, since I rigged. It's the
same mentality that made the ancient Roman
architect stand under a constructed arch when
the keystone was put in place. «Will it hold?”
The others were finally catching up,
and we still needed to rig Bill's. Joe Zo and I
sat below marveling at the light from carbide
lamps streaming down the straddle pit. We
also showed, much to Corwin's dismay, how
deep the pit is as he was traversing the
straddle. "Rock!.....
..................... thud.” “Great.
Thanks, guys."
People were moving down the ladder at
a quick pace. I was feeling confident about the
rope possibilities. I had a clue this time.
While tying on the rope pad, I did the rock test
for Stephanie and Eileen at Bill's. “Rock!...
...........(a sound like wind blowing across a taut
piece of plastic)..............SMACK!” “Oh, my
gawd!" "We're rappelling that?” This was
many people's over 100 ftrappel. Hearts
raced. Pulses quickened. After I amazed Joe
Zo by not creating spaghetti with the 200+
rope, we started our descent I must say that
Bill's is the sweetest rappel, at least for those
who utilized the handy ledge. Eileen and a few
others decided to deal with the lip the hard
way. Luckily, they all won, but it wasn't an
easy fight. As for the rappel itself, Corwin
discovered what happens when “belay” is
yelled during a descent. The pit wall became
ten feet way, and he jerked to a halt. 'Taint
nothing like the shock of education. Joe Zo
also had many of the trainees stop half way
