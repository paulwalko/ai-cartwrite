up in a tight spot in a very unconfortable position. Great Photo
stuff! I started digging into my pack, trying to get my canera
while asking Pete to "hold that pose." My request was not warmly
received, and by the time I had my camera out he had freed himself.
I decided to settle for a picture of him starting to come back
through the crawl in the other direction. (Photographers are of-
ten only barely tolerated on caving trips, so I decided not to
push my luck too far too early, for fear ny canera would be per-
Ranently placed where the sun never shines!)
After a long stretch of unpleasant passages and crawls we
arrived at the "Gypsum Roon". We lost almost an hour here, find-
ing the passage (hidden in a breakdown pile) that continued on.
Eventually we did find it though, and proceeded through another
series of crawls â€¢ Bore of a nuisance than particularly long or
difficult - and arrived in the "Supper Roon".
After a short rest in the Supper Room, ("Roons" towards the
back of New River are the size of passages I've seen in other
caves) we climbed maybe 100 feet down through a breakdown pile
to the beginning of "Slab's Crawl". Following the crawl we cane
to a comparative rarity back there, walking passage. Of course
all good things end, and this nice passage took us to the "Meat
Eater". The Meat Bater is fairly tight, but its main drawback
is that it's studded with nodules and sharp rocks that "punch"
away at your body and clothes. We simulated various noises of
digestion as we progressed along its "digestive tract". Sean
and I were both heartened when we finally heard Pete, who was in
front of us, yell that he'd just popped "out the ass".
A few feet out of the crawl we came to the "Devil and Miss
Jones", a red clay sculpture of unknown (to us) origins, We stop-
ped while I took several pictures of this famous landmark. From
there we followed stream passage for awhile, then began an upward
series of climbs through a lot of breakdown. The last of the
climbs was not particularly difficult, but involved just enough
exposure that we used a belay. A rescue from that far back in
the cave would be virtually impossible.
From there we followed fairly level passage for awhile, past
the bottom of a pit, then began going up again, we finally
reached one side of the ceiling of the pit, known as the "Cross-
over Pit". There was no doubt that a belay would be used here.
The crossover consisted of a combination step, straddle, lunge
and bellyflop above 60 feet of darkness to the other side. Im-
mediately on the other side was a rather uncomfortable climb
down, with few handholds and the pit on one side if you happened
to bounce in the wrong direction.
From the Meat Eater on we had been getting in damper and
muddier passage. Now we were in walking passage, but the floor
was 4 or more inches deep in sticky, gooey mud. Finally, one
short "wedge-and-grunt-no-handholds-climb" got us to the formation
Room, a beautiful and unspoiled area of white calcite formations
and crystals. We stopped here while I took many pictures from
various angles and trying for various effects.
