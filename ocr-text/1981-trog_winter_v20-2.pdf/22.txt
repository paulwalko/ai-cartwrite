Editor's Column
Well, another quarter has come to a close, and with the end comes another
action-packed issue of the Tech Troglodyte. I hope everyone enjoys this issue
and finds everything to their liking. The cover drawing (courtesy of Nancy
Moore) will hopefully satisfy the women cavers who felt slighted by the last
cover drawing.
TIME
Now it is time for me to get atop my soapbox and preach fire and brimstone,
death and destruction, nonsense and bullshit. The third meeting of Spring Quar-
ter is the for club elections. This, coupled with the fact that many members
will be receiving their degrees in June and (maybe) leaving the area, will re-
sult in a big turnover in the people heading many positions in the club. It is
up to those of you who will be here next year to run the club. It doesn't run
itself.
If you don't have much time to offer, there are still some jobs you can do.
Â· Hell, the more people involved in a job, the less time per person is required
to accomplish it. Some people claim they don't like the way things are run.
If you don't get involved and try to change things, then shame on you. If you
can perform a job for the club, do it. If you're not sure you can do it, try.
If you're absolutely certain there is nothing you are capable of doing for the
club, become Trog editor.
In closing, I would like to take the time to thank all those who contri.
buted articles and illustrations. Without them there wouldn't be a Trog. I
would also like to thank Sharon Brinkman, Roberta Desrochers, and Paul Kirchman
for helping me type up this bugger. So until next issue, cave safely.
