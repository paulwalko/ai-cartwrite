but weak, patient showing signs of moderate hypothermia. The examination re-
vealed that considerable vaginal damage had occurred, with the possibility
of pelvic damage also. The evisceration that had been reported to us, instead,
was a prolapsed vulva, which had been severely contused and had engorged with
blood from internal hemmorage and had turned completely to the outside. To
the lay person, this would have indeed looked like an evisceration with organs
protruding. There obviously had to be a laceration because of the blood loss,
but this cannot be located because of the vaginal swelling. The patient is in
moderate hypothermia, but is better off than we had expected. The patient has
been stripped of all her wet clothes after her fall and placed into a sleeping
bag the party had carried into the cave with them. Time now--aproximately
12:30 a.m. The patient has now been injured approximately 4 hours.
Before IV therapy and rewarming measures can begin, the problem of con-
structing a bridgeway to the patient and stopping the flow of air through the
"blow hole" had to be accomplished. This was done by taking two pack frames
from the caving party and placing them over to the ledge on which the patient
rested. The air flow was curtailed by placing a poncho over the entrance to
the "blow hole". Treatment could now begin.
Since the patient is relatively stable, an IV of Lactated ringers, is
started--KVO with a 20 gauge angiocath, by ST Link. The vaginal area is co-
vered with sterile dressings, soaked in saline and bandaged three corner diaper
style, into place. The patient is kept in the sleeping bag and chemical heat
packs are added to the bag to help rewarm the body. As her body receives the
additional heat, the IV is increased slowly to 100-150 ML per hour, to prevent
vascular overload and an acidosis problem. (These two problems are prevalent
in hypothermia and occur because of peripheral pooling of the blood in the vas-
cular spaces.) As the peripheral vaso-dilation occurred, the added heat was
also carried to the body core to help stimulate the rewarming from within.
This process had worked well some five months earlier and again appears to be
working well, but required constant monitoring. The IV bag is place in a BP
cuff which is then inflated to pressure-infuse the solution. The bag is then
placed inside the sleeping bag with the patient to speed the rewarming process
by heating the solution itself. The patient is now beginning to wake up and
has stopped shivering. She is becoming progressively more alert and oriented.
She is also becoming acutely aware of the pain she now feels. Nothing else can
be done except reassure the patient and wait on the arrival of the stokes and
the rest of the rescue party. Time now--1:00 a.m.
Even though it has taken only two hours to locate the patient, it will
take much longer to get her out of the cave. Where we can crawl on our hands
and knees, the stokes will have to be pulled along. Where we can go under a
boulder and through a passage, the stretcher might have to be rigged and hauled
up 20-30 feet, then moved laterally 2-3 feet, and then lowered again. All of
this is very time consuming and very strenuous. Time now--1:45 a.m.
The glow of the approaching headlamp through the darkness, signaled the
arrival of the stretcher with the remaining contingent of personnel. All along
the exit route, people are left to rig for the extrication of the stretcher,
As soon as the stretcher passes them they will tear down their rig and join
the main group.
The patient, still in the sleeping bag, is placed into the stokes and
