Grotto Grapevine
At VPI Grotto, knot-tying has always been popular. As of late, however, an
exceptionally devious type has been gaining popularity for the purpose of ir-
revocable bondage. I know you're all drooling to find out what this marvelous
knot is. Moose Dawson and Karen Maus have tied the knot, as have Walt Pirie
and Cecile Keller. And Bill Stevens' time is approaching to tie this same knot
with Pam Buzas. By the way, the club is not considering making this a required
knot.
Through the kindness of Ed and Nancy Richardson, a goodtime was had by all
on New Years, or so Ikm told. This person put its body on automatic party,
while its soul conversed intently with Bacchus in the corner on the subject of
favorite flameouts. Dave Shantz, yours still rates as one of the tops. Thank
you, Buckwheat and Nancy, for sacrificing your home once again.
The annual Banquet was a success and we have Boo Croft to thank for that.
It felt good to party in the VFW Hall once again. If any of the newer members
had any doubts of partying hard in this establishment which is used and run by
"leaders" of the city of Radford, those doubts were quelled by the sweet aroma
of puke which greeted each person as they approached the bar.
In the beginning, there was 506 South Main Street. This little known ver-
sion of Genesis was recently unearthed in the club files, giving a good indica-
tion of just how long this hallowed hall has been in cave club control. Unfor.-
tunately, the day of reckoning is at hand and Main Street House will soon be no
more. Yes, the angel of the Lord cometh, brandishing a flaming sword, and ye
must repent. Well, repent ye or not, Main Street House is still being sold,
forcing Glen Davis & Company to move out by mid-April. The sign-out sheet will
be at Hugh and Joe's apartment, when the move comes, and a new home for the res-
cue equipment is still pending.
