A shout from our right and above, focuses our attention on the oncoming
headlamps. The other search party has now linked up with us and are hurriedly
told of the possible location of the patient. As we cross the "Polished Rock",
we can see the glow of the headlamps in the passageway above. The victim has
now been located, about two miles into the cave, but a new problem confronts
the rescue team and adds to the dilemma for the patient. She is lying on a
ledge on the far side of a "blow hole#passage, separated from the team by a
three foot wide chasm that dropped about twenty feet into the underground
stream. A "blow hole" is a passage that allows a cave to breathe in and out
as the outside barometric pressure rises and falls. Air is constantly forced
in and out of the opening of the passage. Our patient's hypothermic problem
is now compounded. Two questions have to have answers quickly--first, how to
reach the patient without falling into the chasm and second, how to minimize
the flow of air past the patient. One thing is for sure--we needed more help
quickly. A runner is sent back to the cave entrance with this message and our
location, to be passed along to the command post.
While all this is going on in the cave, preparations for the patient's
extrication from this cave are being handled smoothly from the command post.
The VPI Grotto, masters at riggings for ascents and drops, will do the actual
physical extrication phase, with the Giles crew handling the patient. The
Giles crew has now been in the cave over two hours. As the members of the VPI
Grotto start to climb to the entrance, a roster is taken and passed along to
Giles Second Lieutenant, Jackie Redder, command post coordinator. The runner,
who had previously been sent from the cave with the request for more help, now
arrives and the call goes out. The Blue Ridge Grotto from Roanoke, Virginia,
and the Holston Valley Grotto of Kingsport Tennessee, are notified and put on
standby. Larry Reynolds, one of Giles' Cardiac Technicians, also enters the
cave with the VPI Grotto.
The in-cave roster of Giles people included Captain Steve Davis, R-AMT
Paramedic, Sargeant J.C. Link, EMT-Shock Trauma, Jerry Redder, EMT and Caver,
Mark Davis, Caver, and Pete Sanvigne, Caver, with VPI Grotto. When it becomes
apparent from the manner that the extrication will be a long one, more medically
trained people are called for. Christiansburg Rescue Squad Cardiac Technician,
Tim Johnson and EMT-Shock Trauma, Dave binkous, responded. It would take them
some time to begin the ascent and enter the cave. Christiansburg Rescue Squad
will also send their Advanced Life Support unit to do the actual transport of
the patient.
One of the items taken into the cave with the VPI Grotto is an ABS stokes
stretcher. This stretcher is specially lined with foam rubber to help insulate
the patient, once she is placed inside. Helping to coordinate and control the
flow of people and supplies into the cave, is First Lieutenanti. Ave Dolinger,
EMT, and Randy Shamblin, EMT. The Giles Crew brings items to the cave entrance
where Dolinger and Shamblin will assign them to be taken inside. They also
keep Montgomery County Hospital Emergency Room staff updated on the progress
of the rescue by low band radio.
Back in the cave, the examination of the patient is proceeding by Para-
medic, Steve Davis, while Shock Trauma Technician, J.C. Link, prepares for IV
insertion. The victim is a white female, approximately 18 years old, weight
115 pounds, who had fallen over a protruding rock, spread-eagle style. The
amount of blood loss is substantial, BP is 120 over 90, pulse 120, regular
