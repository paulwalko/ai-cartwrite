From The Podium
Soon, elections will be coming up and it will be time to relinquish this
despicable job of chairman over to some other harlequin. I hope that my succes-
sor learn as much about himself and life as I did.
Yes, it has been a busy quarter. Besides school work coming out of my ears,
plans for the region meeting are beginning to materialize. The location is the
campground at New River, upstream from McCoy Falls and Fool's Face. There are
many activities planned such as caving (trips to New River, Pighole, and Starnes,
to mention a few), rock climbing at Fool's Face, and a geology field-trip planned
by John Lohner and Ed Fortney. Sharon Brinkman is planning to cook Saturday's
dinner and we are looking for programs for Saturday night. A schedule of events
will be available that weekend. I would like to thank everyone for their en-
thusiastic offers to help.
The man-made back-entrance to Pighole, constructed in the mid-50s, began
showing signs of weakness, hence it now has a meton log stuffed in it to prevent
casualties. Joe Zokaites is investigating possible solutions for its reconstruc-
tion.
The fence-building project at New Castle has been rescheduled for Saturday,
March 28th, and Eric Harper is already planning to buy a keg for the campout.
. The property surrounding the upper-entrance to Smokehole has a new, unfriend-
ly leasee; we should limit visits there until the situation has been investi-
gated,
Richard Cobb has turned his rope tests over to Rich Neiser, and Rich has
all kinds of ideas for testing.
We had a successful ridge walk on Spruce Run Mountain on January 16th (brrr,
we froze our proverbial buns off.). Rich Neiser has followed up on filing the
report in the club files. Further exploration is being carried on by Jim Wash-
ington, Ed Fortney, and Dave Coakley.
Ed Devine's scaling pole was successful and a virtual monumental achieve-
ment (no pun intended) to the caving community. Unfortuna tely, after investo
ing over 300 man-hours in two trips, none of the leads in Paul Penley's went
anywhere. Anybody need a ham radio antenna tower?
The dye-tracing project continues and has recently verified that Newberry's
is the hydrologic center of the Skydusky Hollow System.
Well, this brings the closing of my last president's column (Do I hear
cheering?). So keep your head low, your nose muddy, and your gonies high and
dry. I salute you, VPI cavers.
Cheers,
