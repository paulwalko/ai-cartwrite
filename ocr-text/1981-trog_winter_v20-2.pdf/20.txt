The Mapper's Apprentice
It's been five years now and I'm about to graduate, so I suppose my story
can be told. Let this be a warning to young, unsuspecting trainees that they
might avoid the terrible fate that has befallen me.
It was fall quarter, 1976, and I was a happy-go-lucky freshman without a
care in the world. All I had on my mind were classes, college women, and beer,
though possibly not in that order. Coming to VPI from Maryland, I knew virtually
no one on campus, hence, I relied on the computer to randomly pick me a roommate.
Fool that I was, I felt no fear when I read the name Bill Koerschner over mine
on the dorm room door.
Kirchman, Koerschner, coincidence maybe, fate, or perhaps something hor-
rible I'd done in a previous life; the latter I tend to think. I'm not going
to say I was an impressionalble youth, but the second weekend of that first quar-
ter he had me caving. Caving, ine caving! Before coming to Tech I had never
heard of the sport. Little did I know that for the next four years I would
live, breath, eat, and talk caves.
I must admit, he was clever. He never forced me to go caving. He just
asked, "You want to go caving kid? It's pretty tough, but you could probably
handle it." I had no idea I was being groomed for a needed position. Koerschner
loved to map but had no brunton reader, hence the ploy, "Think you could read
brunton kid?" I fell hook, line, and sinker. I learned to read brunton and
went on so many trips with Bill that we were called the Kirsh brothers.
Living in the same room made organizing trips quite easy; it also took all
the trouble out of cleaning up... we never did. Yes, Koerschner taught me a lot
that first year. "Yeah kid, I used to take showers every day just like you,
then I discovered this," said Koerschner as he turned from the sink holding up
a can of anti-perspirent. "You can stretch showers out until you start to itch
and never smell too bad." Needless to say nobody on our hall really understood
us.
Yes, Koerschner has won another soul for the voracious appetites of the cave
gods. I must try to warn others though, before they too fall into his trap.
The man is evil I tell you. He was here long before I came as a freshman and
now I'm graduating, yet he remains. Has anyone noticed that he doesn't age?
He's not human; he must be stopped. I'd drive a silver stake through his heart,
but have you seen the price of silver lately? He must be stopped! He must be
stopped! He must be stopped...
