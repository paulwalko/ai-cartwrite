From High Rock's base, some miles below,
Near where two creeks together flow,
Some years ago a cabin stood,
Begirt around with virgin wood,
Whose inmates were of humble birth,
Not wealth, but virtues real worth--
Aheritage still handed down
To all who wear a worthy crown;
And to them, in the course of time,
A son was given in their prime .
Skyduskee was of massive frame-
The Red Man gave to him his name
Because he was of stately form,
Both tall and straight- a soldier born,
With darkened brows and flashing eye,
From dangers front would never fly;
Whose motto was: To never yeild
Till every foeman quit the field.
Rather than show the feather white,
Would bear the name Harman 'til his plight.
