strapped in securely. Now, besides the cave as a whole, only three major ob-
stacles lay in our path; the creek, the drop to the China Slide", through
"Kevin's Crawl" which is a 65 foot long tunnel, approximately 3 feet wide and
244 inches high, that turns to the right approximately halfway through, and the
near vertical descent as we exit the cave. All this, along with approximately
two miles of slippery rocks, ledges, water, stalagmites, and stalactites, will
provide us with some of the hardest physical labor that any of us will do for
a long time to come. In addition, this will prove to be a real test of our
rescue unit.
The creek passes without incident, but at the entry to "Kevin's Crawl",
the IV had to be worked on to keep it running. This being accomplished, the
stretcher again moves through the crawlway and down to the "China şlide'.
This is an ascent approximately 100 yards long which is on a 60-65° incline
and is, as it indicates, a smooth slide. With the expertise of the VPI Grotto
riggers, this incline is surpassed with minimal difficulty. The patient is
now doing well (talking, oriented, little pain except on movement) but the
initial stabilization team is getting colder and more sluggish as time passes.
Time now: 3:00 a.m.
At the entrance to the "Lunch Room" of the cave, a problem develops.
The patient cannot stand the constant jiggling that is going on as the stret-
cher is manually hauled over the rocks. The only solution is for everyone to
form a column and to lie down on his or her back and to pass the stretcher
overhead until we are clear of this section. As the stretcher passes from
one person, he gets up and makes his way to the head of the column and takes
his place in line again. This leap frogging technique works well and is com-
plicated by only one factor--the water that is running over this section that
one has to lie down in. Time now approximately: 4:00 a.m. Time to exit is
1 hour.
C-T Reynolds, Paramedic Davis and ST Link are taking rurns travelling i
beside the stretcher, constantly evaluating the patient but now. are so cold
that their judgments have become sluggish. The initial team has now been in
the cave over six hours. Ahead, in the passageway, the lights of CT Johnson
and ST Linkous, of the Christiansburg crew, become brighter. They are indeed
a sight for sore eyes for the Giles crew. The care of this patient will now
be turned over to these two capable people until they exit the cave. Then,
someone from the Giles crow will have to make the near vertical descent with
the stretcher.
At 5:10 a.m. the patient, along with her entourage of every tired, wet,
and cold rescue person, leave the cave. Now the descent to the waiting ALS unit
will begin. Paramedic Davis preceeds the stretcher down the slope and contacts
Montgomery County Hospital UHF telemetry radio, to advise them of the patient's
injuries directly, and of the prehospital treatment that has been initiaated.
Orders are given to start a second IV, Lactated ringers, wide open and to trans-
port. When the patient arrived at the unit, this was done quickly and the
patient is removed from her damp sleeping bag to the warm blanketed cot in the
unit. The transport to MCH will take just over 1 hour. The patient is turned
over to ER personnel at MCH at 7:15 a.m. "She is stable and in surprisingly
good condition," commented Dr. Easter, El physician.
While the transport to MCH is taking place, the long job of equipment clean
