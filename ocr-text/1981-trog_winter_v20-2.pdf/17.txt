up is beginning. In all, 3 rescue squad units, utilizing some 38 people, will
be involved in this rescue. During the extrication phase of the rescue, there
will be approximately 42-45 people in the cave at any one time.
This rescue utilized all phases of rescue operation; initial search and
location, stabilization, extrication, pre-hospital treatments, UHF telemetry,
ropes with riggings and tear downs, and litter handling. All this is done
under the cooperative efforts of the Giles crew and the VPI Grotto. Both
groups, now held a new and respected admiration for each other. Total time of
operation: 8 hours.
All of the cooperation, teamwork, mutual aid, skilled riggings, pre-hospi-
tal care, and everything that goes into a prolonged operation of this size,
can be suitmed up in the following statement that was issued to the other two
grottos from Roanoke and Kingsport that we placed on standby: "OPERATION
COMPLETED... LORRIE SHERVACK MADE IT"
Brickyard Ridge Cave
Brickyard Ridge Cave is a modest-sized maze located outside Princton, West
Virginia. It is developed in the Avis limestone (Upper Miss.), which is less
than 40 feet thick in the area. The complex eastern end of the cave is located
under the swampy floor of a blind valley whose stream seeps into the cave along
many joints. The cave carries the water through the hill, which forms the end
of the blind valley, to & spring down the hillside from the entrance. The long
entrance passage is an abandoned route the stream took through the hill at an
earlier stage of cave formation. At the present time, the cave stream seeming-
ly drains to the northeast, but the location of the spring indicates that the
stream eventually turns and flows back to the west parallel to the entrance
passage. This is another instance in which the direction a stream flows in a
cave cannot be used to predict its ultimate destination. Much of the cave de-
velopment appears to have taken place in the phreatic zone as most passages
display rounded cross-sections and undulose ceilings characteristic of sub-
watertable formation. Many of these passages were later modified by vadose
stream action, resulting in a tube-on-canyon morphology. Massive collapse and
sandstone rubble influx is the rule around the east end sinkpoint areas. The
large rooms which occur in this part of the cave formed by this process.
Survey of the cave was completed in three trips; made memorable by the
usual assortment of bashed shins, pulled gut muscles and scraped vertebrae as-
sociated with the survey of tight, bitchy cave. Final cost of the venture was
a new gas tank for the pimp-mobile, which got bit by the landowner's driveway.
