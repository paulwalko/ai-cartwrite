This article was chosen from among sixteen entries for Rescue Call of the
Year--1980 by the Virginia Association of Volunteer Rescue Squads at their 1980
Convention. This article was written to impress rescue squad smen, not cavers.
Giles County Rescue Squad acknowledges the fact that the rescue and the award
could not have been achieved without the help of VPI grotto.
Rescue Call of the Year â€“ 1980
January 18, 1980--10:00 p.m.
Less than five months prior, we had made this precarious ascent, and here
we are again; avoiding the same rocks and ledges, clinging to the same bushes
and vines and because of the equipment we carry, we are huffing and puffing
like a locomotive on the seventy degree ascent, only 600 feet vertically, but
a quarter mile as the trail winds its way up the mountain face. As we reach
the end of the trail, the entrance to the cave becomes visible in the cold
January night air. Now only one thing separates us from the patient--a cave
with over 14 miles of maze passage and crawl ways.
The New River Cave at McCoy, in Giles County, was holding its second vic-
tim in five months. From within the cave came a grizzly report given to us
by two members of the victim's party that had come out for help--one victim,
hypothermic, bleeding, evisceration with organs protruding. Time was really
becoming of the essence. Certain information has to be extracted quickly.
Where exactly was she? Was this area accessible with a stokes litter? How
did she appear to be doing? As we prepare to enter the cave, one thing became
all too readily apparent. The two members of the victim's party that had come
out did not know how to get back to where she was, nor could they tell us where
she was. Entering the cave to locate a victim at a known location is difficult
at best, but to find one in this cave at an unknown location, is almost an
impossibility. We elect to divide our initial response team into two groups,
both to meet at the "China Slide" in two hours, if no patient is found.
Since radio communications from within the cave would be impossible, a
runner will have to be sent out with information to be given to our relay per-
son at the cave entrance. The VPI Grotto had been contacted as soon as the
call had been received, and help from their end is enroute. Long Shop-McCoy
Rescue Squad will handle the in-cave rescue and establish and maintain the com-
mand post.
As our parties separate and begin checking the side passages of the main
corridor, one thing is bearing on everyone--we were taking a lot of time be-
cause of the unknown location of the victim. As the main corridor progressively
narrows to meet an underground stream, approximately two miles into the cave,
the two members of the victim's party are becoming very distraught. If only
they could find the big rock they had crossed just before she fell! It was
so smooth and shiny! The faces of our rescue team all lit up at once. The
"Polished Rock", as it is known, was only a few hundred yards ahead, but was
accessible from this point only by wading through the chilly waters of the unt
derground stream. The shock of this cold water as we waded knee deep through
the stream, was to say the least, stunning. It seemed as though we would
never reach the crawlway to the "Polished Rock".
