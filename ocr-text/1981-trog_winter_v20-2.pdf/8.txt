RETURN TO NEW RIVER
Two years ago, on my third Trainee trip, I went with Bob
Alderson, Bill Koershner and Rolf McQueary to the very back of
New River cave, while I had wanted to go on the trip (dumb!),
and while I also never regretted having gone, I also could see
no reason why I should ever want to do that again (snart:).
Well, two years can dull a lot of memories (especially those
of pain), and nobody, to my knowledge, has ever gotten any good
pictures of the back of the cave. Not having been on a Photo
Trip for some time, I saw this as a new challenge. I sought out
Pete Sauvigne and Lawrence Britt for assistance on this trip,
since they'd both been to the back within the last year, and were
more familiar with the route. I asked Pete first. He replied;
"I've already been to the back twice, and that's already one more
tine than any sane person would ever want to go." (Smart:) After
some arm twisting and coercion, a few beers, and being reminded
that caving and sanity have no relation whatsoever, he finally
agreed to go. Then we approached Lawrence. Lawrence jumped at
the "chance". ( Dunb, Dumb!)
At the meeting we picked up a fourth person, Sean Pederson,
a Prospective member looking for a good, long "bust ass" caving
trip (Sucker!). Plans were made to neet at the cave at 8 AM the
next morning.
About 6:30 or 7 AM, Lawrence called to cancel out of the
trip (Maybe not so dumb after all) since he'd been up all night,
getting Sharon to the hospital after her accident. So it was
down to just Pete, Sean and myself. As we arrived at the cave
Sean was bright eyed and eager to be going on a "good" caving
trip. Pete and I chuckled to ourselves.
We were in the entrance at 8:45, having already used up all
the excuses we could think of to delay it. The trip back to the
Falls was about as familiar and uneventful as finding your way
to the bathroom in the niddle of the night - you can almost do
it with your eyes closed. The only thing worthy of note on this
part of the trip is that Pete proved at the "Blowhole" that New
River cave does in fact "breathe". We: paused to note the stoppage
of air flow in one direction as it prepared to reverse directions.
The reverse flow was not as strong, but very definitely present.
We rested briefly in the "Boulder Roon" above the Falls, and
then started back into the narrow, tight passages and crawlways
leading into and out of "Tuxedo Junction" - a particularly tight
and unpleasant section of the cave. At one point Pete became hung
