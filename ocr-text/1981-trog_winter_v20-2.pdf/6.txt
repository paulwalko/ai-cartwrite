A Day In The Life Of A Caver
It started out quite ordinary. Pete Sauvigne and myself were to
meet Steve Lancaster, John Lohner and Dave Shantz at the rear entrance
of Pig Hole for the "corking" of the collapsing man-made entrance. Pete
and I were looking for a suitable plug when we saw Steve's car go speeding
past the rear entrance towards the main entrance shaft. "I hope they didn't
think we were trying to seal that one" we chuckled, figuring that they
would soon meet up with us. About 30 minutes later we became concerned
and Pete started after them before they finally realized where they were
supposed to be. Dave never showed up, but Keith Smith had tagged along.
Shortly thereafter we located a suitable plug; a locust log which
weighed about 500 pounds and took all five of us to handle. Not wanting
to totally destroy the rear entrance we used a 1:1 pulley system to lower
the "cork" into position. We placed a sign with an explanation of the
reason for closing the rear entrance and the club's address at both entran-
ces and included a warning in the land owner's log book. With this task
completed we headed to Clover Hollow for our planned caving trip of the
day.
While enroute I remembered a report that Steve had given at a meeting
about some holes in Clover Hollow that he found while on a friend's farm.
We thought that since the day was nice and the time seemed right we'd at
least stop and check them out.
The first hole consisted of a fissure about 30 - 35 feet long and
five feet wide. Across the top of it was a large tree with roots that
spanned the gap, indicating that it had been there long before any open-
ing ever existed. Steve and I quickly seized the opportunity to explore
and were rewarded with a mere 20 feet of passage. When Pete dug through
his gear to find his hardhat to take a look for himself, he found to his
chagrin that it wasn't there, "So much for Clover Hollow"we said, and off
we went to check out the second hole that Steve knew about.
This cave turned out to be much more significant, as evidenced by
the map on the facing page. It had been named "Michael's" after the cur-
rent tenant on the property, but later checking in Douglas's Caves of
Virginia showed it listed as Mike Breen's Cave! Just by coincidence I
had my survey gear along and I said "if we can't finish this in one hour
we'll quit." Keith read brunton, with John's careful guidance, helmetless
Pete set stations (he wasn't worried with a 20' average ceiling height),
Steve scouted things out and I took notes. One hour and three minutes af-
ter entering we left the cave with a full set of survey notes.
Not content with our day's activities so far we decided on a sport
trip to Castle Rock. After a short visit to the site of the longest ty-
rolean traverse on a single nylon rope ever, we rappeled and prusiked
the afternoon away.
This would have been a great stopping place for this fun day, but
Pete and I knew it was too good to be true when the phone rang just as we
were sitting down to our second beer and a fine spaghetti dinner. True
to form, it was RESCUE TIME! But that's all in a day in the life of a caver.
