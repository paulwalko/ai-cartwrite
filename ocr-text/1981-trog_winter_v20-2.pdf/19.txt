A Trip To Roppel
Since its discovery in 1976, and breakthrough in 1978, the exploration and
survey of Roppel Cave has been one of the biggest scoops in the country. The
project, headed by the Central Kentucky Karst Coalition (CKKC), has been adding
on the miles, threatening the status of some of the biggies. Located near Mam-
moth Cave National Park, the cave has racked up 23 miles of passage and is
stretching out its arms to several systems in the area.
Through the persistence of Ed Devine and myself, we managed to arrange a
trip to Roppel through Jim Borden of D.C. Grotto. So on Saturday, November. "
22nd, Bill Koerschner, Bill Stephens, Ed Devine, myself and Pete Crescilies,
our fearless leader, headed into the cave and to the outer limits of the Lower
Black River, about four miles from the entrance. It took us about 72 hours to
reach our survey point, the trip involving everything from the tight canyons
of the s-survey to the megatrunk of the Black River (the P-survey). Pete said
that our trip was probably the furthest from the entrance to date.
Borden could not have set us up with a better escort. Pete was a quiet,
clean-cut medical student that could plain haul ass in a cave. He explained
the cave to us and related some of their hypotheses on the system as we quick-
ly moved through the cave. At A27 in the "muck-water canyon", Koerschner, Ed,
and I started our survey. Pete and Stephens went ahead to survey down a big
side lead. We mapped upstream out of the muck-water and through the clear-
water canyon, tied into their lead, and boogied up to a dome complex. We hit
a virgin lead that was just eating up the 50-foot shots, 8 feet high by 15 feet
wide, off of the lower east side of the dome. This was a Virginia caver's
dream: non-stop, booming, virgin passage. Even though we were overshooting
our rendezvous time with the other crew, the word was, "Go for it!" Pete fi.
nally came down to where we were, so we quit mapping and ran down the passage.
Ed said that he always heard about caves in Kentucky where you check out a lead,
run down the passage for miles, and never see the end. And we, were doing it.
We finally came back to the dome where Bill and Pete were waiting.
Impressed, but tired and hungry, we started the long trek out. It didn't
take us that long to leave because we moved quickly and efficiently. We made
it out in about the same time we made it in, giving us 22 hours underground.
Our team had mapped 2011 feet, and the other team of Pete and Bill mapped 1620
feet. This brought Roppel up to the 2nd largest cave in the state and 18th
largest in the country, with about 24 miles of passage.
There were two welcome items on the surface. One was an old friend, Bud,
and the other was the CKKC fieldhouse, complete with wood stoves and real beds.
The drive back to Blacksburg proved to be a challenge in itself, with prevail-
ing stormy conditions. To top it all off, we managed to get a speeding ticket
in West Virginia. We all undoubtedly had the best trip of our lives, but we
realized that these guys are doing a lot different type of caving than we do.
It's likely that Roppel Cave might be setting some underground endurance records.
