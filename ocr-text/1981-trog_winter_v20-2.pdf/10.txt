From the Formation Room we went down a sheer, moderately
difficult climb. to more muddy passage. Pete encouraged us as
we climbed down by telling us that a fall and broken leg that
far back "could be fatal".
Eventually we came to stream passage. For awhile we chim-
neyed and walked on ledges and breakdown 10 or 15 feet above
stream level. There was also a straight section, barely shoulder
width with vertical walls, that we chimneyed along just above the
water. We went high one more time, then finally came to a straight
section of stream, 200 or so feet long, about 3 feet wide and ver-
tical walled. There were enough projections on the walls that we
could chimney and straddle to keep our feet dry.
At the end of the stream was the "end" of the cave - a huge
pile of breakdown going all the way up to the ceiling. The water
flows out of the breakdown pile, so there is definitely more
cave beyond, but no one has ever found a way through the break-
down. We had made it to the "end" in about 7 hours, still reas-
onably enthusiastic about the trip - though we knew that would
probably change drastically before we saw the entrance again.
We stopped for about an hour to eat and rest. I scouted various
Photo possibilities, and finally decided on a multiple flash ex-
posure of the long straight stream passage, which we did as we
were ready to leave.
The long hours began to tell on the way out. There was not
as much idle chatter, Sean no longer talked about what a "great
trip" this was, and my camera did not see nearly the loving care
going out it had seen on the way in. Every time it saw particu-
larly rough abuse I'd apologize and remind it of an earlier prom-
ise that some day it would have a soft life like other cameras,
taking pictures of birds, flowers, and Bowser, In the meantime,
if it could just make it a little longer...
We were also reminded that, early that morning we had cold
heartedly doomed several six packs of beer to the cold and dark
confines of a cooler full of ice. We came to deeply regret the
callousness of that act, and resolved to exit the cave as soon
as possible to "rescue" them. We were sped on our way by their
faint cries for help in the distance,
Our pace became faster and faster, but our rest stops also
came more frequently and by greater necessity. We talked of how
we could hardly wait to see the Falls, since we'd be "almost out
of the cave" by then. Yet once we passed the Falls we were
so tired that even the short distance from there to the entrance
seemed like miles. But when we emerged from the entrance (exit?)
with bruised and battered bodies and our clothes hanging in shreds,
14 hours after we had entered, we were almost running!
