THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1973
We continued down the drop, then following a stream passage
we came to a 30-40 foot waterfall.

invited him to come see it's wonders and to explore the water-
fall drop, on January 6, 1973, Dennis Webb and I slid down the
shaft to Robbins Rift and worked our way back to the waterfall.
After an hour of dropping boulders and rocks over the edge, we
