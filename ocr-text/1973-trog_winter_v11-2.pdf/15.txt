THE TECH TROGLODYTE

will never be convinced of the need for him to learn a lot of ver-
tical techniques, nor should he be,He has learned the basic re-
quirements for membership and, for him, that is all. He has no
need to know something that he will never use in his type of cav-
ing. When he sees a pit, he leaves it to a "vertical caver", who
should know how to do it. The problem is that the vertical caver
often doesn't know how. This problem is indicated by the fact
that most of our rescues involve people who, for one reason or
another, have been unable to ascend a drop. Injury is seldom in-
volved. It would seem obvious that the place where effort is:
needed is in the training of people who cave vertically, rather
than expending all the effort on practice rescues and such which,
I believe, serve very limited purposes. The person who really
understands his equipment and can use it to the utmost advantage
will most likely not even need a rescue and, if any problem does
develop, may be able to solve it all by his Ionesome- or at least
within the confines of his trip. Now, what if help is needed from
back home and those people have never practiced for the real thing?
: Well, for one thing, there should be cavers available who
. understand their equipment and how to use it (I am assuming that:
they have done this instead of the regular rescue routine). They
are good cavers and understand caving. They should be able to
get these people out without any problems. The only training not
directly connected with caving that we need teach people is the
prevention of hypothermia (exposure) while the stuck party is
waiting to be extracted. If we run into an injury where common
knowledge firstaid: will not suffice, we will have called someone
else into the case anyway. But injuries of this type rarely hap-
pen; the last that we had in this grotto was in 1964 and that hap-
pened because the caver prevented her chest prá»¥ssik safety type
belay from catching her by holding on to it while falling on
rappel. (THE TECH TROGLODYTE, Vol. III, no. 2, page 31). This,
again, was a failure to understand equipment... Now, I might need -
a rescue next weekend, but I think there are some people here who
can do the job, : What I would like to see is more: work done in
preventing these situations rather than in solving them..
