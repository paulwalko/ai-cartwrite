feet into a cave, but I have seen traces far inside Báne's Spring
Cave in Bland County, Virginia. Due to haman settlement, the
packrat is less commonly found than in the past.
Characteristics
The packrat is a large ratlike animal with big ears and eyes
and weighs about 6-18 ounces. It has a buffy gray back, buffy or
reddish brown sides, a white belly, white feet, and gray ears,
The fur is long and soft and is grayer than the hair of the Norway
rat. The winter fur is darker and grayer than the summer coat,
Color is the same in both sexes, but with age it becomes duller
and browner,
Unlike the house rat, the packrat has well-haired ears and
tail. The tail of the Allegheny packrat is bicolored being black-
ish dorsally and white ventrally. The tail is used for balance
and is normally extended and horizontal. When excited, the animal
carries the tail high. The tail acts as a brace in fighting and
feeding. "" It is also lashed from side to side as a warning signal.
When asleep, the pa ckrat curls up and wraps its tail around its
body.
On the ventral surface of the packrat is a narrow strip with
little hair. The area is worn and discolored (especially in males)
during the breeding season. A dermál gland secretes a strong
smelling substance which the animal rubs over the ground, probably
to communicate his location. (Poole, 1940, p. 263).
Behavior
Nests are found on the ground, in trees, in ditches, and
especially in caves. The nests are well made of shredded wood,
sticks, leaves, and any objects that the animal can carry. One
nest, that I found on a ledge in New River Cave, contained a wire
screen, several flashcubes, leaves, sticks, bits of rope and
clothing, a firecracker; wire, a tin can, a cigarette pack, gnawed
acorns, broken glass, loosé dirt, and a theater ticket. Packrats
leave the coarser materials on the outside and line the nest with
soft items, A nest has several "doorways" which are often barri-
caded with sticks, leaves, and other objects, . · Cave rats are clean
animals and make refuse piles away from their nests. They store
food and desirable objects in piles close to their nests. The
nests are often divided into a nursery, a living room, and a stor-
age area, Nests seem to be passed down generation to generation
with additions constantly being made until large nests are formed
in isolated places. In populous areas there is an increase in
new, smaller nests. Unlessi completely destroyed, damaged nests
will be rebuilt. Also, nesting materials will be added or taken
away according to weather and temperature conditions,
• The cave rat is a trogloxene, a !.* Cave visitor,' an animal
that habitually enters caves but must return periodically to the
surface for certain of its living requirements, usually food"
