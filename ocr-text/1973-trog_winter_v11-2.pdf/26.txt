cave dweller, the packrat is well adapted to the dark. The ears
are large, and the eyes are bright and prominant (although sight
is secondary). The long whiskers vibrate continuously, and the
nose twitches. The animal finds food by smell and touch, It is
guided by its own scent and urine trails, The cave rat follows
established routes which it learns by cautious and gradual explor-
ation. On a known route, it apparantly disregards its senses,
Packrats are skilled climbers and have little trouble with rock
faces or trees, Only rarely do packrats leave home territory, and
during cold weather they are less active,
. The packrat got its name because it will pack home any object
that it can carry. According to Charles Mohr, "Few objects that
can be carried or dragged into its 'museum' are overlooked" (iMohr
and Poulson, 1966, p.114). The animal is also known as the trade.
rat because it will often exchange one object for another such as
a new gold watch for a stick. The animal shows a definite prefer-
ance for shiny items, Objects are carried in the mouth and fore-
paws, In New hiver Cave I left several items including bacon,
bread, flashcubes,' aluminum foil, and some napkins. Only the bacon,
bread, and napkins were taken. Apparently the New River rats
already have a wealth of objects left by humans.
Packrats are not hardy eaters as compared with other rodents,
Five percent of their body weight in food is sufficient daily.
(Cahalane, 1947, p.497). They also require little or no water,
apparently getting enough from green vegetation, Packrats are
herbivores. Excess food, including fungi, is stored. Packrats
also gnaw bones to sharpen their teeth. Captive rats fail to have
as sharp incisors as wild rats.(Poole, 1940, p.257).
Packrats are solitary except when breeding. They often
visit neighboring nests in search of food, but they have little
contact with their fellows. As early as January the male's ventral
dermal gland becomes active, and he looks for a female. When he
finds one, she is hostile and there is much boxing with the fore-
paws. After mating, the fighting is lessened for two to three
weeks until the female again becomes so hostile that the male .
leaves. Despite hostilities, packrats generally mate with only
one female, Gestation is from 23-38 days. The female has four
mammae' and averages two to three young per litter. The female has
two to three litters per year with the young being born from mid-
March to early September. The newborn are blind and deaf, but
they can crawl to find the mother's nipples almost at once. The
young weigh about one third to one half an ounce at birth. In a
few days the middle incisors develop as milk teeth, The young
cling to the nipples until weaning at about 30 days and can only
be removed by a maternal pinch on the jaw or neck. On the fifth
day the coat is silky and pale gray. The animal weighs about one
ounce, On the 15th to 21st days the eyes open, the tail begins to
grow hair, and the young packrat is able to eat solid food. On the
24th day the animal is able to care for himself. After weaning,
the male usually disperses the young and himself. At three months
the animal weighs five ounces and has a buffy coat. At one year
a packrat is sexually mature. The life span has not been deter-
mined, but packrats have lived three to four years in captivity.
