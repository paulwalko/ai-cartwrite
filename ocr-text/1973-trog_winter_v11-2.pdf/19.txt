HOW TO HAVE A 6.5 HOUH TAWNEY'S TRIP..... KATHY CRONAU
On February 10, 1973 I went on one of the more unusual trips
that I have been on to date. The party consisted of Bill Park, ,
Nancy Moore, Rick Whitt, Mike Woolf, Randy Wood, and myself. We
were on a work trip to, of all caves, Tawney's. Although it is
well known as one of the simpler beginner's caves, I'd somehow
missed out on seeing it, so I was glad to have the opportunity to
finally go in the cave "everyone" has been to. The reason for the
trip was to work on a discovery made by Guy Turenne and Mike i
Conefrey the previous week. It seemed that only a few inches un-
der the floor a complete saltpetre works had lain hidden for a
hundred years. Considering that this was a well-traveled part of
the cave, it seemed remarkable that the brittle wooden vats could
have survived.
We left around 9:00 on a very cold Saturday morning, and after
getting permission were able to drive over the field right up to
the sinkhole entrance. It took us no time at all to get to the
room where the saltpetre vats were located. The room is so close
to the entrance that it does not lie within the thermocline of
the cave. Since the cave is so well known, no one happened to
mention that little fact. It was cold!
After looking over the area, everyone pulled out their trusty
Owen's Dining Hall spoons, picked a likely spot, and began to dig.
rieanwhile, Bill and Rick surveyed the area, marking the piles of
dirt and the previously discovered vat, I picked a good spot to
the side of a large pile and started in. Almost immediately I
caine upon small chips of wood, I worked my way carefully around
them as they were very spongy and crumbled quite easily. I kept
finding the tops of boards and would start to dig, thinking I'd
made a discovery, when it would end after an inch or two. After
doing this many times, I realized what my discovery probably was,
the operation's trash dump! By this time I'd gotten pretty chilly,
so I decided to get up and see what everyone else was doing. Randy
had come across a series of boards around the corner from me that
actually resembled a vat, so I decided to help him,
The vat turned out to be made of about six inch wide boards
in a V-shaped pattern with a back at one end that made it resemble
an old-fashioned cradle. One side was intact, and although the
other had cracked under the weight of the dirt, the broken pieces
hadn't gone anywhere so it was possible to reconstruct it by shor-
ing it up. Within the vat we found the remnants of straw and
sticks that were used during the operations to help remove the
saltpetre from the dirt. Digging deeper we finally reached the
bottom of the V where there was an abundance of very fine straw,
The vat was about a foot deep, so it took a long time to pain-
stakingly excavate it with spoon and brush around the fragile
boards, After reaching the bottom, we continued to dig length-
wise, Thevat narrowed, and we finally reached a perfectly formed
trough. It was a half-cylinder of wood that water once ran out
of, beautifully formed and preserved,
