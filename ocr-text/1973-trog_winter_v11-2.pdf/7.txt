THE BEST OF THE WORST Awards
By STEVE KARK
The VPI Cave Club is well known for it's abundance of un-
usual characters, At any Virginia Region function they're usually
the inost active, at any party they're usually the drunkest, and
on any morning-after they're usually the sickest, They fight over
women, steal each other's booze, squabble over politics, "wreck
each other's cars, and sing louder an' worse than a herd of cattle.
But, through all the ups and downs, the hangovers, the long cave
trips and the highway blues; they cling to each other like fleas
in molasses. :
And each year towards the end of February they have a banquet,
They set aside their dusty jeans, and muddy boots for neckties and
sport jackets, and they store away politics for old reminiscences,
Awards are given to those who in the past year have shown them-
selves to be weirdest of the weird and foulest of the foul,
Starting things off ,Bill Stringfellow was presented a large
bottle of heavy-duty oil hair tonic and a blotter paper sleeping
pad for the Grease Spot of the Year Award, Anywhere cavers are
gathered drowning themselves in beer, Bill can usually be found
gorging himself on rootbeer and candy bars, :
Fresh from his bout with the local authorities, our own
B.0.6, member, Jin Hixon recieved the Senile Caver Award, Several
months ago Hixon fixed up his own, batch of home made wine and
for weeks afterward his corpse-like figure could be seen slump-
ed into corners at our after-the-meeting parties. For his humble
attempt at self-embalming, Jim was given a collapsible cane and
a giant: 'Get Out Of. Jail FREE' card. .
i: The Armchair Caver Award was bestowed upon Ned Coleman for
his lack of effort, Ned fell victim to the most common malady of
dedicated cavers- he discovered SEX! His answer- he was m√§rried
just recently..... another bites the dust,
Don Davison , our resident Super Jock, stepped up to
accept the Floyd Collins'Pressing Your Luck Award. For his
attempt at solo caving, Don was presented a portable tombstone
with the inscription: "He caved with the best. He caved alone",
