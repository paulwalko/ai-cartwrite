THE TECH TROGLODYTE
. The packrat shares its home with insects, spiders, lizards,
snakes, salamanders, tree frogs, mice, shrews, and rabbits( Cahalane,
1947, p.49.1); Mites, ticks, fl.eas, assassin bugs; and bot fly lar-
vae invade the body. Natural enemies include skunks, snakes,
hawks, owls, foxes, weasels, wild cats, and man. When alarmed the
animal will thump one or both hind feet and his tail on the ground.
The packrat seldom uses its voice. The young squeal, and a ter-
rorized adult may squeal, .Usually, the teeth are clicked in alarm
when isolated with animals of similar size.
Packrats are of little economic significance to man because
they rarely cause damage. They are timid and difficult to tame,
Naturalists are impressed with their individuality, persistance,
and energy, Country people consider some areas where packrats
are very active in good weather to be "haunted", (Poole,. 1940,.268),
as hüman's rarely see the packrats,
Conclusion
...As a conclusion I want to give some suggestions for the study
of packrats. They are almost always found in cave entrances.
Ledges and rock piles are favorite nesting spots, Moderate light
will not prevent them from being active, The best time for cbser-
vation is from dusk till dawn, but nests can be examined during the
day. Patience is one of the most important virtues in a naturalist,
A lure of sardines in 011 will almost assuredly attract a cave rat
if the observer has the time and patience to wait,
