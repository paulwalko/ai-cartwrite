What began as a simple one afternoon project to dig out a
saltpeter leaching vat has turned into a month long project.
Tawney's cave is listed in Douglas' CAVES OF VIRGINIA ; in the
description there is a line or two about the former saltpeter works,
The 1970 map of Tawney's prepared by myself locates the general area
of the works, But, until this month almost nothing was known about
the operation or its history..
During the first weekend of digging, a trip consisting of Bob
Alderson, Murali Chockraborty, Mike Conefrey and myself uncovered
a single vat and the remains of a group of three vats and and thÄ—:

areas of mattock marks, two overturned vats and an entire wall of
names and dates. The oldest date found was 1857, with several being
during the civil war period abruptly ending with the year 1864. .
The following week brought two trips to the cave. On Saturday
a trip headed by Bill Park uncovered another vat along with some of
its lining materials, Bill also conducted a grid survey locating
the known remains. On Sunday, Mike Frie ders, Mike Conefrey and my-
self uncovered the perfectly preserved trough that collected the
leaching liquid of the vat uncovered the day before. This trough
exhibited extraordinarily fine workmanship. We also located a third
area for excavating.
on the third weekend Boots Yeatts, Mike Conefrey and myself
excavated a five foot long vat that had the bottom burned out. Also,
from remnants of wood found during the excavation of another vat; a
fourth vat was reconstructed near the largest of the overturned vats.
Two circular depressions in a wall of dirt led us to believe that
barrels had been standing there. There is only one more area worth
digging out but there will probably be little uncovered.
Unless some means of protecting the remains from vandalism is
found, we will be forced to rebury our finds in hopes that sometime
