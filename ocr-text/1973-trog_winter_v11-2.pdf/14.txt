OPKDN: CAVE RESSU3
A REALISTIC APPROACH BY, DOUG PERKINS
We look around and see that we suddenly have with us again
the old subject of cave rescue. This is a subject that I person-
ally do not like to discuss, but since it has cost me some valu-
able partying time in talking about it recently, I think that it is
Â· time to put some thoughts down on paper. To start with, we never
talk about this subject in a realistic manner. Sure, we begin by
planning help sessions concerning the use of caving equipment,
vertical equipment, and so forth, but the discussion always gets
back to the formation of rescue teams, first aid training and
other such male. bovine excrement, Why not take a look at the prac-
tical considerations concerning such programs?
A CAVE RESCUE TEAM: This is probably the most over-rated of
all grotto safety projects, To begin with, there isn't enough
interest in the idea to get the team started. Even if the instruct-
ors are available, they must have people to work with, Here they
do not, our people are simply too busy caving, partying, and try-
ing to stay in school to have the free time to put in on such pro-
grams, Nor is there reason to believe that the situation will be
any better in the future, for it certainly hasn't aroused much
enthusiasm in the past. One would think that a knowledge of basic
firstaid would be a prerequisite for forming such a team. Well, a
firstaid course is given on campus at least once each academic
year and often it is given each quarter. How many people do you
know that have taken these courses? Not many, I bet, And of
those who have, how many of them want to spend the time necessary
to learn technical cave rescue techniques? How many want to spend
one weekend per month in their dorm or apartment, WITHOUT GETTING
DRUNK, waiting on a rescue call that will probably never happen?
Now you are beginning to see why these teams don't work out.
Let's not even mention Bill Karras and the other organizations
that went off the deep end with rescue work. Thinking about res-
cues all the time brings on a mentality which is decidedly not
healthy. Let's think about something that is healthy-like pre-
venting rescues.
Most accidents in a cave are caused by the individual caver
who overestimates his physical ability or fails to understand the
proper operation of his equipment, Few accidents are caused by
falling rocks, cave-ins and other problems that people often
associate with caves. Thus, it appears that the easiest method of
cutting down on the chances of a cave rescue is to teach people to
make intelligent judgments as to their own ability in caving and
to teach them how to make the most out of the equipment that they
will have with them in the cave. This has to be done on an indivi-
dual basis. No program will ever give all the cavers in this club
the same level of ability, just as out trainees and members now
vary widely in ability. Joe Caver, who only does horizontal caves
