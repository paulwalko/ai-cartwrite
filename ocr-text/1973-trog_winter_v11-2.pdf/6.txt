:: A man walking along a jungle path leading to a village
came upon a man badly mauled struggling to crawl. Trying to
help, the man asked him what had happened. The mutilated man
looked up at him but immediately turned his head away without
saying a word; for he recognized the man as a worshiper of a
religion not his own.* The kind man said he would go for help
and ran down the path to the nearby village, As soon as he
stepped into the village clearing several arrows from the archers
of an invading army pierced him. The mangled man, not far from
death, cursed himself for not telling the man about the army in
the village from which he had just escaped. Now he had no chance
of being saved and worse, there was no way to warn nelghboring
villages. All because of an obsolete rule he followed made by
his forefathers' for some unknown reason,
This story sheds a little light on the purpose of this arti-
cle. Making rules requires a great deal of thought. The club
should think a little about the purpose of motions, admendments
and the constitution. They should not be thought of as enter-
tainment for the meetings. 'Constitutional admendments are hard
to change once made. Motions made by members reflect the current
club policy. . A majority voting for a motion represents the club
policy and should the majority switch sides in time they can
simply change policies by another motion. No future generation
holds an obligation to the out-of-date policies of the past,:
This idea must be kept in mind when considering constitutional
admendments.
A constitution merely sets a basis for governmental function
of an organization, Its intended vagueness allows each genera-
tion to adapt to the time and situation offered. They interpret
the constitution in a manner that best suits them, Precise.
definitions placed in a constitution reflect only the attitude
of one time period. A f√ºture generation stuck with ideas far
out-dated (such as the required use of manila prussiks) makes
little headwayPlacing precise definitions is one of the cave
club obsessions. The force we put into adding these useless
phrases may hurt the club in the future.
We are trying to make a constitution that w111 cover every

the constitution, for each generation must be allowed to inter-

Last of all, we place too much emphasis on rules, policies,
orders, ordinances and what not. We are a group of people with
one strong common interest-caving.. Since we have an interest
in one area we should be striving for: achievements in that area,
not in how the club can be politically handled, We are all
friends who should need no rules to get along,
