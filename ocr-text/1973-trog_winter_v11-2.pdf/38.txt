the other hand, if everybody who passed the trainee tests auto-
matically came into the club, why did the founders of the system
make it necessary to get a two-third's vote? Shouldn't those who
know caving have some say over who passes on the know-how to
future novices?
Then there's the old question of "personality differences",
It's not really fair to keep someone out of the club because of
a moldy grudge, social prejudices or just because you don't like
their looks. But then, what if for some reason you just can't
get along with someone, how can you trust yourself with him if he
doesn't offer you respect of integrity, person and property?
It's no secret that people behave underground much the same way
they do above ground. Besides, if two-thirds of the people can't
voice confidence in a person, what is he doing there anyway?
Arilot of people do want to be objective and open-minded,
but find it hard to make anything but vague notions out of what's
going on around them. Give some thought to the following questions
as criteria: Is this person competent to make decisions in a
crisis? Will he encourage people to safe caving? Is he capable
of leading a trip of neophyte cavers? If someone inquires about
the patch he's wearing with the funny gorilla, what kind of im-
pression of caving will he leave with them? What does he have to
offer the future of caving? Another way of looking at these tough
questions, is that most cavers have learned most of what they know
after they've become members,
Without a doubt, all the definitions will never be the same
(what a boring club that would be!), and the arguements will contin-
ue, But maybe, just maybe, if all the different approaches to the
:: question are considered, a better perspective can be found.
One final question which is basic to some and ignored by many,
is "Why bother to become a member anyway?" The answer lies in the
fact that coming up for membership in the Grotto is not like pled-
ging a frat, (though it may seem so at times) but becoming an active
part of what's really happening. If someone goes to the efforts of
learning about caving to qualify, then he has acquired enough know-
ledge to have his own opinions and possibly ideas on how to improve
things. It's kind of hard to make constructive changes if you
insist on abstaining on membership. There are lots of things going
on in the Grotto, also the Region and the NSS, that need construc-
tive attention and the only way to see to that is to be part of it.
