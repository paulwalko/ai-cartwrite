asleep standing up (a bad exposure symptom). Caver. no,2 coiled
the rope to keep warm as no, 1 headed up the 50 foot drop just
ahead, Caver no. 2 did a one-legged prussik up the drop in about
10 minutes with no problems. Caver no.3 was last up the 50 foot
drop. One ladder climb later the three cavers emerged from the
cave around 8 in the morning. ",
All three slept for a couple of hours and then started the
drive back to Blacksburg.
What were the results of the ordeal? Caver no.2 undoubtedly
suffered the most. He had large sores on his arms from the attempts
to keep onto the rope and fix the rig. He also had bitten a large
hole in the inside of his mouth because of the extreme cold under
the waterfall. For a period of about a year after the trip he.
experienced some numbness in one of his legs. Both cavers 2 and 3
experienced great pain with every move for about four days after
the trip. Water had tightened their muscles.
However, both cavers no. 2 and 3 were back in a vertical cave
in West Virginia one week later, taking part in one of the last
"caver" trips to Grapevine Cave (one with heavily bandaged arms.)
Now it's time to examine the causes of this incident:
(1). Since the cave was not originally in the itinerary of
the cavers, they were not aware of the waterfall and were not pre-
pared for it.
(2) This was the first time that caver no. 2 had used his
jumar rig in a cave, and no doubt that was a major part of the
problem,
(3) When caver no.2 first experienced problems with the
jumar rig, he should have switched over to one of the other two
systems he had on him (cams or knots), particularly since his
light was hopelessly out,
(4) Caver no. 2 should have had a second light source,
This may have been all that was necessary to get him out of the
second predicament.
(5) The probable cause of no,2's problem was that the sling
from the top jumar was becoming stuck in the cam of the bottom
jumar allowing neither of them to move,
Conclusions :
(1) Cavers 1 and 3 were right in deciding to pull up no. 2
immediately upon no. 3 reaching the top. .
(2) All three cavers were dangerously close to collapse
from exposure and exhaustion even before doing the 50 foot ascent,
(3) The skill and experience (not to mention the cool) of
caver no. 3 saved the day, also no.'s 2 life.
(4) Caver no, 2 did not panic, mainly due to the confidence
he had in himself and his fellow grotto members.
