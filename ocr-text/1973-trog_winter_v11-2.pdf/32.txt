directly through the waterfall and caver I was soon soaked, but
safe at the top of the drop. Both cavers 2 and 3 had jumar rigs,
Caver no, :3 had a small flashlight. Caver no.2 had a set of climb-
ing cams and prussiks as spare ascending rigs, " ;
Once caver no.1 was off-rope, cavers 2 and 3 attached all the
camera gear to the end of the rope to aid in climbing with the ju-
mars, with everything still going smoothly, caver no.2 rigged into
the rope and began the climb to the top of the drop. It wasn't
long thereafer that caver no.2's carbide light was extinguished by
the waterfall and he was forced to climb in almost total darkness,
It will be interesting to note at this point that caver no.1 was
also without light and was out of earshot due to the noise of the
waterfall.
About 20 feet up the drop something happened that caused caver
no,2's jumars to jam, Repeated attempts to move the jumars while
holding into the rope led only to very tired arms and hands,
Fortunately a ledge was nearby and caver no. 2 was able to get off
the rope and onto the ledge in total darkness. A quick untangling
of slings and a few moments later saw the jumar rig back on the
rope, hopefully for good. Throughout this first hangup caver no, 1
was in complete. ignorance of what was happening, and caver no. 3
was in constant contact with caver no, 2, The ascent continued.
smoothly for another 30 feet until the jumars jammed again. There
was no opportunity to get off the rope at this location as there
had been at the first. Arms and hands were even more tired now than
before, having had about 20 minutes in the cold water as well as
the first bout with the jammed jumars. Caver no. 2 held himself in
close to the rope trying to let the blood rush back into his arms.
Time was important now. The jammed rig must be freed before his
hands became too numb
The carbide lamp was still out at this point ( the flint was
wet ) and all attempts at finding out what was wrong with the rig
had to be done by touch only. Caver no, 2 could not readjust the
rig since his hands were nuinb and strength in his arms was failing.
He shivered at the bottom of the rig, he had been in the waterfall .
almost 30 minutes. His hands were so numb he couldn't feel the
difference between the rope and the swiss seat sling of his rig.
Caver no. 1 was still ignorant of anything being wrong except
to note that someone else should been up the rope by now. Caver
no, 3 realized that swift action was necessary since. exposure of
all three cavers would soon be a critical problem. It would be
necessary for caver: no. 3 to jumar over caver no. 2 on the rope.
Caver no. 3 ascended the rope as far as caver no. 2. His light
had also been extinguished in the waterfall, and most of his climb
was in the dark. Due to the darkness, caver no. 3 imagined that
he was spinning very fast on the rope, even though he wasn't
(caver no.2 confirmed this when no.3 insisted he was spinning while
caver no.2 was holding him still). Therefore, caver no.3. was rather
sick to his stomach by the time ge reached caver no, .2 (about 50').
