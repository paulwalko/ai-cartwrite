WINTER
THE TECH TIOGLODYTE
.
1923
It was approximately one and a half hours before caver no, 3
successfully crossed over no. 2., This long time will be under-
stood in light of the fact that both cavers, had very numb hands,
were shivering at an unbelievable rate, and working by the light
of a small flashlight. Great care was necessary in moving rigs,
since both sets were identical, Caver no. 3 proceeded to the top
of the drop after a short rest. Once there, he informed no. 1
of the problem, and together they worked out a solution.
In addition to the other miracles of the trip (such as caver
no.3 having jumars) there were many bolts in both sides of the
passage at the top of the drop. Also, caver no, 3 had a pack i
generously filled with sling and carabiners. Using the bolts,
jumars, sling, and 'biners no, I and no. 3 rigged a 3 to 1 mech-
anical advantage to pull no. 2 up the drop.
At, this point it is important to note that this cave is far
from any available rescue team and that caver no.2 had already
spent 3 hours under the waterfall, Blood circulation in no, 2's
feet was being restricted by the tightening rig. His legs and feet
were becoming dangerously numb. The slumped position he was in
put the falling water directly on his chest. In view of these
circumstances no.'s 1 and 3 had three choices once no, 3 had gotten
to the top. They could go for help, they could go to the car for
more rope and let noi2 back down the drop where he could re-rig
with prussiks, or they could pull no.: 2 up with a mechanical ad-
vantage. The first choice was definately out, considering the
he' .
time involved; . The second could not be sure that caver no.2. could
climb the drop with prussiks, therefore, the greatest expedience
was found in choice no. 3. -
This plan of action required about 32 hours of steady work
by the two cavers on top. Even though they had rigged the mech-
anical advantage, they were pulling a 175 lb. caver, 30 lbs. of
camera gear, the friction in their rig, and the friction of the.
rope along about 30 feet of the drop. "The effort was monumental,
to say the least. A jumar was used to hold the rope in place be-
tween "heaves" Only a few inches could be pulled at a time. AS
caver no, 2 came claser and could talk to no, 's land 3 the effort
became less grim as success was in sight.
At the end of the 33 hours of hauling, no, 2 was in a position
where he could sit on a protrusion from the wall. Here he loos-
ened the constriction rig on his feet and attempted to stand. The
first attempt falied, but as blood rushed back into the legs and
feet, he was able to stand. At this point it was possible for
him to climb the remaining 30 feet of the drop. Before doing that
he had to pull up the remaining rope and camera gear, so it would
clear the overhang. Once this was done completed the climb, with
a belay, and joined the others at the top of the drop.
After much rejoicing, it became clear the time was of the
essence in getting out of the cave, Cavers 2 and 3 were falling
