Grotto membership is ar issue
that is as various as the number of
Grottos, Some caving groups need to
attract and hold members in order to
survive as an organization, while
others set up requirements that
make membership more selective,
The intention here is not to ex-
plore the different systems to
make Grotto members, but to look
into the particular situation here
at VPI.

After a caver has done the.
trainee thing, taken tests, had
tasks signed off, hex faces the rit-
ual of coming up before the club, en
masse, to be voted in, Usually this
is a matter of routine, no hassels,
even with a measure of merriment, and
other times, well uhhh, it's different
What happens, why is this so?
It should be mentioned first of all,
that the basis of any arguement is a difference of definitions.
Once all the terms are defined, an argument ceases and it becomes
a discussion. Something that also deserves mention is that once
a person becomes a member of the VPI Grotto, he has the right to
use his vote anyway he chooses, not the way others think he should.
Most cav…ôrs make a serious effort to use integrity in club matters,
but even though someone simply flips a coin to deterimine the fate
of a potential member, then he is perfectly within his right to
vote as he sees fit. After all, the club once upon a time gave
him the priveledge to make decisions. Instead of voicing rounds
of intimidating verbage at the person who doesn't vote someone
into the club, maybe we can take a look at some of the reasoning
used in admitting or not admitting people into the Grotto,
Some cavers believe that anyone who takes the time and goes
through the routine of traineehood, he should become a member,
no matter no matter what. Even if the guy is a bungling idiot
who trips over his own boot laces, he'd be better off caving with
the Grotto where at least where we can keep an eye on him. After
all, the club is supposedly dedicated to teaching and maintaining
safety practices. Besides, it's not too good an idea to turn
someone on to caving and there turn him off; he'd probably go
right on caving with someone else, or worse yet, by himself On
* the use in this article of the masculine form of pronouns does
not by any means intend to exclude the feminine forms, but the
english language being what it is, "he" will have to do.
