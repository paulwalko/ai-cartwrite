REPORTS
MDAT
_writing a trip report is an old
tradition of our cave club and each prospective member must
submit one for final membership, The Troglodyte usually
publishes a few of these reports. Although" you may or may not
find grammatical perfection of scientific exactness in them,
you will find the words of people excited and interested
enough with caving to write down their thoughts about it.
ROBBINS RIFT CAVE.....
KEITH ORTIZ
Being the finie upright sprig of a lad that I am, I thought
twice about my invitation to Gene Montgomery's PSC Christmas
party. It seemed that they were going to serve "alcoholic bever-
ages". I finally decided to go and make sure that they didn't
have too much to drink, As more and more eggnog began to flow,
I finally suckered myself into investigating a new lead in Bob
Robbin's new find, "Robbins Rift Cave", I heard wonderful stories
about how a dye test showed up 7 miles south in Starr Chapel Cave,
how Robbins Rift could have a water connection with Butler-Sinking
Creek, how all the large caves in Bath County (Breathing, Butler,
Aqua...) had to be blasted open just like Robbins Rift had been,
I had just enough eggnog to convince me to go..
Located under the beautiful Bath-Highland County hillside
in a large size sink, is a small mineshaft, put there by the PSC
and some other hardy souls, On December 28, a plebe from the Naval
Academy, Art Nalls, and I submerged into the darkness of Robbins
Rift Cave and went down an unassuming hole on the right side of
the entrance room, which immediately came to a 15 foot drop.
Plebe: "How do we get down this here hole?"
S.C.: "Don't worry, Super Caver will show yong"
(LOUD INTIMIDATING NOISE...)
S.c,: "That's how you DON'T do it!"
