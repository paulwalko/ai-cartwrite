THE TECH TROGLODYTE

in the future they will be ex.cavated again,
. This cave is heavily traveled by locals and students. On a
given weekend there are no less than five trips into the cave.
During the periods. of our :excavating, we encountered five non-
grotto trips. Most were conscientious cavers but some were not,
Reburying the remains may seem selfish but, if left uncovered the
reinains, being quite fragile from decay may not last two months.
Already, in the time the works have been uncovered, some have been
destroyed. Either way very few people will see the saltpeter works. :
Perhaps sometime in the future when vandalism is no longer a
problem, it can be uncovered once again, In the meantime almost
100 slides have been taken and a slide show is in the making.
From the remaining physical evidence, the history of the
operation can be put together,
The mine was in operation during the civil war. This is
indicated by the large number of names and dates from that period.
The operation itself was of a moderate size; all told there are
remains from 10 vats and several piles of used dirt, water for the
leaching process was hauled from the stream located about 100 feet
further into the cave, Various troughs collected the leached ma-
terial. This saturated liquid was then scooped out into large :
barrels, These barrels were then taken out the sinkhole entrance
for further processing.
In 1864. the Confederate Army retreated up the Salt Sulfer
Turnpike located about 200 yards from one of the entrances,
Apparently the miners attempted to destroy or cover up their
operation before the Union troops arrived. This is attested to by
the burned vats and the fact that the remains appear to have been
purposely covered over,
For years these remains were unknown. But, this just goes to
show that even in a well known cave new discoveries can still be
found.

(The VPI Cave club would appreciate any suggestions or alter-
natives to recovering the vats. We have considered gating the cave,
which would probably involve no minor expense, Any contributions
or suggestions may be mailed to us at our mailing address on the
cover.
