.: I began caving in the fall of 1969. On many
caving trips. I have observed the interesting habits
of the Allegheny packrat, also known as the woodrat,
the trade rat, and the cave rat. The scientific name
is Neotoma magister Baird which equals Neotoma penn-
sylvanica Stone, I have studied research done on the
packrat and have observed the animal in more detail.
The results of my study and observations have led me
to a better understanding of the life history of the
packrat.

. Unfortunately, I have only had a quick look at
a packrat as it was chasing me out the entrance pas-
sage of Link's Cave in Giles County, Virginia, My
attempts to photograph the animal in New River Cave
in Giles County on May 11, 1972 were unsuccessful, I
put bread, bacon, and various shiny or soft items in
the entrance room, but no rats appeared. I was able
to investigate and photograph a few nests.
Distribution:
Several species live in the eastern United
States. The general range is the Appalachian Moun-
tain system from western Connecticut to Northern Ala-
bama, In Virginia, packrats are found from the Blue
Ridge Mountains westward, but they have been seen as
far east as Arlington County, The habitats include
ROBYN cliffs, rock slides, and cave entrances at high ele-
IF FON : vations, Karely do they go further back than 300.
