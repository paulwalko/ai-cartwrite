PRESIDENTS
COLUMN
Well, it's that time of year again, when the club takes
part in what is usually the most competitive event of the
year--the election. With the election so close, this is my last
president's column, so I thought I would say a few things about
recent events in the club,
As you can see from the front cover of this issue, we
have a new Trog staff this time, co-editors Steve Kark and
Tom Calhoun. It looks like they have some fresh ideas and the
ability to construct a good publication :
Recently, one of our trainees had somewhat of a rough time
being voted into the club. In fact, I'm sure you're all aware
that le's's than 2/3 of the voting members voted for him the
first time but he was voted in the following week, I'm glad
he didn't become discouraged and quit after the first try.
I have seen this happen a few times, and each time it raises
the question in my mind, "Just under what circumstances should
a trainee not be voted into the club?" As far as I have seen,
each of these people should have been voted into the club the
first time. They showed interest in the club and in caving
and had completed the trainee program. However, questions
are always raised about the person's ability as a caver, how he
would react in a rescue, and personality conflicts. The latter,
of course, is irrelevant, unless the person is so obnoxious
that he can't exist with anyone in the club in which case
he would most likely be weeded out before he completed the
trainee program. Not only that, but our organization has always
been a conglomeration of weird personalities, As far as the
person's abilities underground, especially in a rescue, I
see very few people in the club who could lead a rescue, and
moreover, a person does not stop learning by any means, just
because he becomes a member. Let's try to get interested
cavers into the club and not encourage caving outside of the
club by not voting them in..
It's been a rewarding experience being the president for the
past year but now it's time for me to step down and once again take
my chair in the group so: I can harass the new president from
the floor,
Steve Hall
