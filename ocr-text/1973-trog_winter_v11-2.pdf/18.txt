THE TECH TROGLODYTE I

finally were able to brace one boulder against another and tie
in. We descended into a large passage connecting two rooms with
80 foot ceilings, Another stream entered from the right, it
came from a muddy tight chimney passage through a virgin helictite
birthground (if you can imagine) and became too tight to follow....
Downstream siphoned and all other leads deadended except for some
ceiling holes we couldn't check, We found that we could climb
in and out of the rooms without rope which would have saved us
2 hours if we had found it earlier., Dennis loved the rooms So
much that he decided to name them after me (Keith's Folly), but
being the modest lad that I am, I had to decline, ,
We went down to the large dry room and soon came to a muddy
pre-rigged rope on a 30 foot canyon drop. Here, after Dennis
went down and belayed, I showed him how to execute a one hand
rappel, His leg healed just fine! We proceeded up the same
rope rigged on the opposite side of the canyon and went to the
formation room. The room has calcite formations and waterfalls,
but it's main attraction is it's calcite crystal filled pool..
Dennis claimed it was the prettiest pool of it's type, It's a
small pool in a room about 2 feet high and it's surrounded by
calcite waterfalls, Above the inch long crystals is a stalactite
with a 12 to 14 pointed calcite star on it's tip. I was impressed.
We then went back into the grung and raunch of the cave and
exited by the traditional route and up the icefalls in the shaft.
The brisk 25° weather showed a very beautiful starfield and I
· pointed out various interesting constellations as we chipped our
coveralls off,
Back at Aqua campground we enjoyed Art's beef stew and drift.
ed to sleep pondering the excitement of the day and dreaming of
à return trip..
