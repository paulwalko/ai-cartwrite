CLUB FILES......Bill Stringfellow YVPI 154) has been at work
putting our club files in useable order. Many inembers have taken
advantage of the storehouse of valuable information housed in the
files which is also our club liberary, Among it's contents are the
following: reports and maps of caves in Virginia and elsewhere in
the country, topographic maps., numerous publications: put out by
caving organizations (such as grotto journals, Speleo Digest, NSS
News, NSS Bulletin, Caves and Karst, Bat Research News, and even
some foreign publications); club history as recorded in the
minutes of our meetings, important correspondence, reports, etc,
( Here you will also find a complete report of; the Catawba Murder
Hole accident, our discovery of ancient indian bones which were
given to the Smithsonian Institution, and many other items); club
photographs, old cave registers, several books ( such as Caves of
Virginia, Caverns of West Virginia, Speleology-the Study of Caves,
Cave Surveying and Mapping, etc.) This is only a small sampling,
so let's treat. our files with pride...
:: Incidently,Bill is still looking for issues of our old
club publication the Grotto Grapevine, plus old NSS publications,
and other cave related matter to acquire for the ever expanding.
We would welcome all contributions or sales of fers,
: :CAVE SAFETY ....The club has indicated plans to keep local
and other state rescue squads posted on cavers available for cave
rescues.
with regard to club trips, a resolution was passed at a recent
meeting to start rescue operations at the time listed "expected
time arrival" (ETA) on our sign-out sheet for any cave trip that
has not reported in by that time, rather than allowing a lengthy
grace period as has been done in the past,
:: Gene Harrison (VPI 62) has been been largly responsible for
an introductory cave-oriented first-aid session, in which he was
assisted by Bob Barlow (VPI 89), and a self-rescue Vertical work-
out in which members tried various techniques such as rappeling
part way and changing over to ascending gear, as might be necessary
in an emergency situation..!!!!
Practice rescues were led by Don Davison (VPI 140) in New-
castle Murder Hole and in the entrance of Clover Hollow.
The duties of Safty Committee Chairman have been separated
from those of the Vice-President who remains in charge of the
Trainee Program,
BRIEFS ..... Bill Park: (VPI 95), Supply Committee Chairman,
always. thinking of our caver's needs, has added rum-flavored butter
candy, made in England, to his list wares. Ingredients listed are:
sugar,glucose, salt, and flavoring; it does not break or melt too
easily and is a fast energy food, good for long caving trips.
