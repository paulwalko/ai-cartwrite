NEW PASSAGE IN CLOVER HOLLOW...iii.... HERB. SAFFORD
Members of party-Gene Harrison, Steve Snelling, Nancy Moore,
Randy Stoutenburgh, Herb Safford
Length of trip- 9 hours
Date of trip- 1/21/73
Although a short trip, as Clover Hollow trips go, this 9
hours was the most rewarding period I have spent caving to date.
The original intention of the group was to take a quick trip
through the "tourist route"; we did not even intend to do the :
Andrews Room drop. The result, however, was the discovery of a
significant new passage and a major room in an entirely new sec-
tion of this relatively well travelled cave.
Our entrance drop was uneventful, We passed through the
crawlway under the Haystack, over the short climb, back-rappeled
the flowstone", climbed the 12 foot" climb, and rigged and rappeled
the Canyon Room drop. Steve led us to the top of the Andrews
Room, then to the Gypsum Room and the Thistle Tube. I was the
only member of the party who had already ventured into the
Thistle Tube, so I was excused while the others tried their luck,
each being timed from the bottom until his feet were all the way
out of the Tube, Randy had excellent time, something like a
minute and one half, Nancy was only a little slower. Gene
Harrison placed a long third and we gave up timing Steve who did
eventually make it out under his own power. Thereafter we rested
in the library, distributing and commenting on the literature,
which was admirable from my professional view.
The first part of the cave which I had not seen before and
which we visited this trip was the passage to the half-way point
in the Andrews Room, After this we crawled the mud river, and
eventually ended up in Clover Hollow's major stream passage,
Travelling up stream, we arrived at the turn off to the Fourth
of July Room and the Formation Room,
The passage through these rooms is short, ending in the
Formation Room, principally noteable for a bat which hangs from
a stalactite's tip. We rested here, and I noticed a small ledge
with some debris in the channel leading under it; I asked Steve
where this went, and he replied, typically, "Crawl down and
look," Since the debris looked as though it must have floated
to its resting place at one time, I thought there might be an
old stream passage leading back to the main stream, so I did
crawl about 8 to 10 feet under the ledge, where I confronted
another, much lower ledge, about 6 inches high off the ground.
By tilting my head under the ledge, I could see that there was
at least open space on the other side, and that seemed to war-
rant further investigation. I called Steve to look. No reply.
I called again. This time he replied "No," Each request that
he take a look was met with further and more adamant resistance,
until finally he just broke down and crawled in to relieve my
