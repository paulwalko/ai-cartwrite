nagging. Once in the crawlway, he did realize that the lead had
possibilities, and we commented that we would have to return
another day to dig the ledge out. Before leaving, just on a
chance, we began to dig at the large blocks of mud, cracked and
quite dry, forming the floor under the ledge. To our surprise,
these came out in large chunks. Soon Steve was pulling these
blocks of mud out just as fast as I could take them and put
them to one side, Steve tried going in on his back, No way.
His knees wouldn't bend in the right direction. More digging.
Now Nancy joined us, and she was able to crawl through to re-
port that in about 20 feet the crawlway opened up to walking
passage. Now Steve went through. They disappeared. Then Gene:
came along and also went out of sight. By this time I had tired
of waiting and went through myself, a little later to be followed
by Randy. The crawlway opened up, and in a little while we were
joined at the end of a large breakdown room by everyone in the
party. We knew the discovery was significant; apparently it.
hadn't been mapped by Bill Douty, and probably it was absolutely
virgin, Not a footmark, much less a surveying station.
On our return, we took a higher side passage, This put us
in what has since been named "Echo Hollow", a very large room
filled with tremendous chunks of breakdown, one of the largest
rooms in Clover Hollow. We spent as much time as we could afford
on the small supplies we had brought through the tight crawlway,
poking through the breakdown, probably about 30 feet to what we
then thought was the bottom of the room. Deciding we were run-
ning out of carbide and water, we returned to the formation room,
and headed on out of the cave, leaving notes in the log to the
effect that we were pretty certain we had found virgin passage
in Clover Hollow,
Since this trip I have returned to the new section of Clover
Hollow several times, mapping and exploring. We have found some
of the prettiest formations in the entire cave, a possible side
lead that must be dug out, and what appears to be a water table,
about 40 to 50 feet further down in the breakdown than we had
gone on our original trip, Rolf McQueary, Bill Park, Bill Douty,
Mark Slusarski as well as original trip members have helped in
mapping and exploring this new section. According to Douty's
plots put on his old map, this section leads entirely away from
the old cave system, although the bedding planes in the big room
run in the same direction as the planes he had previously sur-
veyed. Even without penetrating to the water level, we have found
the deepest spot yet reported in the cave. All in all, the trip
provided excitement in itself, and an opportunity to spend a lot
more time on a particular caving project. I was fortunate to be
with a good and willing crew of cavers, and to help in finding
what seems to me to be an important section of what was already
our area's most enjoyable cave,
