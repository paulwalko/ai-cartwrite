MEXICO TRIP JOURNAL

(Editor's note: the following is excerpted from Richard Cobb's
journal that he kept on his recent trip south of the border.)
12/28/86 - 2:30 PM: Cueva del Abra - We're finishing up our
first pit, a 380 foot "warmup" drop. Small by Mexican standards,
it's the third deepest cave drop I've ever done. The cave has
two entrances - a horizontal walk-in entrance on the side of the
mountain and a vertical pit entrance on the top.
After the rappel, there is about a hundred foot climb up to reach
the walking passage, which most of us used to exit. A bunch of
locals appeared in the passage to watch the show, which they
apparently see fairly often. I'm waiting at the top of the climb
to guard the rope while writing.
The entrance to the walk-in part is visible from down on the road
as a huge hole in the side of the mountain. The hike up was
steep, much of it a nearly vertical climb up a rock face (which
was not particularly dangerous nor difficult). The rocks were
filled with solution holes and dotted with cactus, some flowers,
and thousands of little bromeliads. The character of the
vegetation was a curious mix of thorny, dry desert plants.
combined with viny, semi-jungle lushness and thickness.
We had to spread out to search the top of the mountain to find
the pit entrance - which didn't take too long. We got hot enough
on this cloudy day in winter to appreciate that we weren't here
on a sunny day in the summer.
Just looking down the nearly 400 foot drop was enough to
remind us what we were doing here. We're going to "do" pits 3 or
4 times this deep - Yeow! The two Canadians (Mike and Mark)
hadn't much experience in climbing long drops and were pretty
nervous. We sent them back up the rope to get some experience
climbing a big pit before getting to the gigantic ones.
Monday, 12/29/86_â€“ Hoya de las Guaguas - It sounded like a
waterfall had started down in the pit. Then they started
swirling out of the top-, a spinning tornado of swifts or
swallows. Parakeets had come out earlier, in small groups of 5
to 20, bright green and circling in tight formation as they
squawked their way out. But these birds were not as brilliantly
colored as the parakeets had been, more like the gray chimney
swifts we see at home.
They came out of a cave about halfway down one of the sides of
the pit and rose out in a swirling vortex in about a turn and a
half. They continued at full force for about 10 minutes, then
slowed and tapered off for another 10 minutes or so.
