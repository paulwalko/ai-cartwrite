equipment. Two local CB clubs fed everyone on site through
donations of hot food and drink from many local businesses.
Neighbors allowed us to tap into their home line to establish
communication with the outside world.
It might be expected that there would have been some jockeying
for position or jurisdiction among all of these groups -- a major
factor of the smoothness of the operation was that there was
none.
One thing that would have made the entire operation easier and
faster would have been a method of rapid communication between
the people devising strategy and the groups of searchers
underground. Because of current technology, the only
communication possible from underground was a phone line from
First Breakdown, the installation of which took several hours of
hard work on the part of a large crew. Because of the size and
complexity of the cave, crews would search and then would not be
able to tell anyone about what they had done for (sometimes) a
matter of hours. This situation was one that would have
benefited greatly from a working voice-transmitting cave radio.
Additional communications problems in callout procedures came to
light during this search operation; particularly in metropolitan
areas which have several caving organizations. It seems that
some cavers were called out as many as eight times, while others
were never called at all. Subsequent reports from those areas
are that the problems are being ironed out.
A consequence of this rescue -- a 'last straw' from the owners
point of view -- is that:
1) the Lightner entrance is CLOSED, and
2)
the owner of the McClung entrance is going to be MUCH more :
cautious about who she gives permission to enter her cave.
Bob Amundson is working closely with her to work out a
reasonable method to ensure that this type of situation does
not occur again.
The amount of effort, money, time, energy, and equipment expended
by everyone -- cavers, local organizations, cave owners,
neighbors, and even the government -- was phenomenal and had the
best of all possible endings. We saved someone's life.
