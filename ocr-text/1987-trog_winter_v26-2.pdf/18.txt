As soon as Dersch had been found, all cavers were recalled form
the cave, and dismantling the operation began. The air transport
was an estimated 15 minutes out of Greenbrier Airport when Dersch
was found. They were turned around in the air and sent home.
Some cavers who had been on the road called in and were told to
turn around. A few more cavers showed up at the site to help.
The various areas of the operations center were dismantled, wire
was pulled from all over the fields and from the cave, gear
found, mostly identified, sorted, distributed to owners or
friends, and packed up. The site was cleared and all gear
accounted for by about 2AM Sunday, September 15.
ANALYSIS
Several things can be said about this search operation. The Ohio
men's trip was poorly planned -- a minimally experienced group
went into a vertical entrance without the gear or skills needed
to climb out of it if necessary, and planned to traverse a
complex cave system of which they had seen only a small portion
(and had never seen a map of the section they planned to travel).
One member of this group had what his companions called "a
cocky, macho attitude" and pushed ahead without waiting for the
rest of the group. They were poorly equipped for anything other
than a "creampuff" trip -- no water, food, or warm clothing.
It must be said that once the people of the original group,
Dersch as well as his companions, realized that there was
trouble, they did everything right. The group he left
immediately sent their vertically experienced people out for help
while the others stayed in case Dersch came back. Dersch
himself, after thrashing about for awhile, conserved his light as
much as possible, did what he could to avoid hypothermia, and
even made an intelligent choice of a hole-up site.
Unfortunately, his methods of staving off hypothermia were the
root cause of the extreme length and high frustration factor of
this search operation. If he had been able to stay put, the
first sweep team into the cave would have found him at about 6AM
Sunday, or later teams would have found him when they went
through the area where he was holed up or through the loop he
traversed to keep warm. If, however, he had stayed in one place,
he would most likely have been seriously hypothermic when found,
and the extrication procedure would have been extremely
difficult and dangerous due to the nature of the cave. As it
happened, when a team went through his hole-up room, Dersch was
traversing the loop; when teams went through the loop, he was
holed up.
As for the performance of cavers and local and national emergency
services, and even local residents, there could not have been a
better response. The roster of cavers on site came to over 160
people. There were 70-100 more cavers on the road or in the air
at the time Dersch was found and the callout terminated. In
addition to this number, there were at least eight fire
departments and rescue squads involved throughout the rescue
providing hot packs, lights, and other equipment, traffic
control, and medical backup. The local National Guard lent
