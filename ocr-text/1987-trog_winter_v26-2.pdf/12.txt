To the southeast, Freeman Avenue parallels the Entrance Passage.
The two passages are very similar in that they are
southwest-trending stream-carrying trunk passages. Freeman
Avenue has more massive breakdown, and many holes in the floor
which drop down about ten feet to the narrow stream channel
underneath. Freeman Avenue eventually empties into Echo Chamber,
a complete siphon.
These two main trunk passages are connected by two routes.
Batbone Crawl, located a short way past First Breakdown, is a
long crawlway entered up high along the wall at either end.
Because of the climbs required to reach it, Batbone Crawl is
easily missed even by those who know what to look for. The other
interconnection route, The Spur, is a northeast-to-southwest
trending passage of moderate size with some crawling. It is
reached after Second Breakdown and is the obvious route to take
from there. The stream disappears at this point and heads
northeast toward Chocolate Avenue.
The northern part of the cave is reached either by Chocolate
Avenue (a hard-to-spot lead which takes off from The Spur) or by
the Wind Tunnel (a major feeder which trends northeast from the
top of First Breakdown). This northern section has extremely
dangerous sections due to the presence of rotten rock.
At the northeast end of Freeman Avenue near Batbone Crawl, a loop
is formed by two passages which meander from North Freeman. Part
of this loop, the Jeb Stuart Area, is hazardous because of
unstable rock in the ceiling and walls. The Seven Fingers
near-loop extends south of this Jeb Stuart Loop, and the
"Fingers" head off from here. This near-loop is either wet
canyon or collapsing and unstable crawlway depending on which end
is traveled.
The Lightner entrance consists of a ten-foot climb-down, followed
by two offset pits of 40 and 35 feet. In order to travel from
the bottom of these entrance pitches, a caver must maneuver
through a short mud-wallow squeeze, get past a mud bank with a
12-foot drop at the bottom (an easy scramble down which requires
a rope to get back up), and then make it through the Champagne
Squeeze to Tufa Trail with its many pools of cold water which are
up to two-and-a-half feet deep. Tufa Trail eventually connects
with the southwestern end of Freeman Avenue.
SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 13
At about 6PM the McClung entrance party entered the cave. They
got to First Breakdown and waited for about an hour or two. They
left a lit candle to show that they had been there, and exited
the cave through the McClung entrance.

At about 6:45PM, the Lightner entrance party reached the bottom
of the first pitch and began the descent of the second drop. At
the bottom, two members of the group explored a little way ahead
