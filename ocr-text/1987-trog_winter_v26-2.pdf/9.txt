Roses twelve were all red
Then you got my head
Out with the brains
Out with the brains
Shibumi muse, Chatterly dream
Rock & roll, and coital scream
Against your actions a moral law
But the mirrors reflected all they saw
Ice on the pond, sleeping bag on fire
Climbs of ecstasy, ways to go higher
Us, a sloosh, a pleasure greed?
Where's the want stop and start the need
Cave... Cave? What's that you say
I'd tomorrow too, but just not today.
Something could be better...

:
It was a great day for chills and thrills! Back at the Organ for
another four hour splurge we entered through the Lipps and past
attentive crawly antenna nasties that infest all entrances. Ever
so gently moving onward we tickled the interior. Quietly passing
winged guards, stopping only momentarily we pay our respects for
granting entry beyond. Pushing further into wet corridors
black-spotted-orange creepies pave our way.
Dive,
dive,
dive,
deeper, harder,
faster... bopping to and fro. Energies yearning for
excitement; sweating, searching, penetrating the maze of
twisted tubulars. More, more. Don't stop!
Down,
down,
down,
in and out
of darkened holes we find our true love and climax in unearthly
amazement. As the last pretty passes out of bounds and the final
rousal-squeeze becomes unbearable our goals are met with joy.
Lights fading fast we scramble outward to recline in peace and
comfort by the heat. Dreams of the event and plans for the next
affair begin to take shape and fill our heads,
Nothing could be finer.
