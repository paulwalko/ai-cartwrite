Christmas

Since the recurrent virulent strain of speleo-travel shows no
signs of retreating, this article is written to promote the
survival of future victims. The specific strain of which I am
speaking is the "Let's go do the big ones in Mexico over
Christmas break" virus. You've all possibly read about seminars
to turn stress into a positive force in your life? Well, I'm
proposing that through proper commitment, planning and treatment
you can turn your encounter with the LGDTBOIMOXB virus into a
positive growth experience.
This bug is for real and should not be discounted. Once you
catch it, it is better to let it run it's course. Those who find
their case arrested prematurely need to give other more
committed individuals early warning or they will find their
future credibility threatened. They may find themselves forever
ranked among the uncommitted.
Planning is all important for this:
E xperience of a
Lifetime
S upplies - wisely chosen, never enough and always too much
Oomph-somehow days of travel, nights of partying and hours of .
sloshing through mud can undue hours of practice on rope.
Territory - includes who's in charge and sharing makes the
trip go easier
A titude-for adaptation to various situations, a bit of Spanish
and a lot of gall in using it and whatever else to get along
Nuts and bolts - enough gear all checked and double-checked for
condition
Organization - a place for everything, a travel plan, road maps,
division of labor and a spirit of cooperation
TREATMENT:
The only proven treatment for the LGDTBOIMOXB virus is to GO.
(Research has proven that the cure is only 10% effective,
however, since most of the victims are heard planning the next
episode shortly after their return.
I hope that by now you will realize that the virus is not to be
taken lightly. Do all you can to prevent exposure but if,
despite all measures, you find you are bitten -
TAKE HEED OF EL SOTANO!
