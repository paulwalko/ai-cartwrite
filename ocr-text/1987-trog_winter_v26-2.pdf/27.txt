the world in some of the most beautiful scenery and weather that
God ever made - and you have one of those rare moments in life
that make your heart sing with the joy of living!
We're at the top of the pit now, a hole so deep that it takes
several minutes of peering into the gloom with shaded eyes before
you can see the bottom (1,100 feet straight down!). Two flocks
of parakeets have already risen from the pit. Since they are
unable to fly directly out, they rise by circling - their squawks
alerting us that they're coming well before we see them. Their
electric green is brilliant in the sunlight, and in the right
direction for photos.
My heart still sings, but that cold knife is also pressing itself
into my belly at the thought of what we're about to do.
3:45 PM - bottom of Sotano de las Golondrinas - It's a magic,
brilliant emerald green, twilight world. The dim light alters
perception - distances are hard to judge. The bottom does not
appear terribly large, until you see a person as a mere speck at
the other side.
The opening at the top is an oval about 150 by 200 feet. I had
rigged into the rope and lowered myself over the lip, all the
while very purposefully looking anywhere but down, until I was
thoroughly committed! A few feet down the rope, the walls of the
cone shaped pit had receded, leaving me suspended in the midst of
vastness. Dangling in that open space, I felt about as
significant as a dust speck in a concert hall.
My rappel had been a rapid one - many people were still behind me
in line. I timed my descent at 6 minutes, some people had taken
a half hour. Four of my six brake bars were hot enough to sizzle
water when I reached the end of the rappel.
At the bottom, the dimensions of the oval are about 500 by 1000
feet. You need to pick landmarks before walking away from the
rope touch-down point or laying down any gear - it can be hard to
find again in the twilight. Most of the bottom and one side of
the hole are covered in emerald green moss - at times in the
summer, sunlight briefly lights the floor. Parakeets squabble
in their roosts on the walk far above us. Several small
waterfalls trickle down one side. Periodically a white cloud
will drift across the sky in such a way that the sunlight
reflected from it doubles or triples the light level in here,
making the green even more brilliant before twilight returns.
This magical realm, in existence for untold thousands of years,
was seen by a human for the first time a mere 20 years ago.
Bamboo spears, thrown by the locals, stand upright in the soil in
great numbers - with even more scattered about. I grabbed one,
to test how deeply it had been impaled in the soil. To my
surprise, it nearly disintegrated in my hand when I tugged at it.
How long had it been there? A year? 10? 100? Longer? An answer
I'll never know.
