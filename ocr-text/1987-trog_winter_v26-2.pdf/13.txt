-- to the mud banks with the 12-foot drop. Jeff Dersch clambered
down the drop and went off on his own. The other Ohio man waited
for the rest of the group to get to the bottom of the entrance
drops. The two climbers in the party rigged the 12-foot drop and
went down to look for Dersch. They checked three possible leads,
and found no sign of him. At this point they decided that they
needed help.
While two members of the original party stayed in the cave and
patrolled between the point at which Dersch had last been seen
and the bottom of the Lightner entrance, the two climbers
ascended to the surface. They contacted the owner of the McClung
entrance who called Ed Swepston, a WVACS member who is also
president of the Northern Greenbrier County Emergency Ambulance
Squad. Ed notified NCRC (which was holding a rescue seminar in
Pennsylvania) and called Roanoke, Virginia to reach Bob Amundson,
another WVACS member who has been mapping McClung Cave for 15
years. Unfortunately, Bob was in Richmond. Chris Amundson
called Bob, and at Swepston's request, called out Blue Ridge and
VPI Grottos.
SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 14
Blue Ridge arrived at the Lightner entrance at about 2AM and four
cavers (Bob Alderson, Doug Feller, Dave Sooky, and Bobby
Voorhees) immediately rigged the drop and descended. They taught
the two Ohio men how to use Jumars and Gibbs to ascend the pits.
When the first VPI group arrived at about 3:30AM, two VPI cavers
(Ed Fortney and Walt Pirie) joined the four from Blue Ridge and
the six of them split up in order to conduct a three-pronged
sweep to cover:
1)
Tufa Trail,
2) southwest in Freeman Avenue to the Spur and then
northwest to Second Breakdown,
3) northwest in Freeman Avenue to Batbone Crawl and then
around the Jeb Stuart Loop.
Jackie Redder (VPI) determined that only VPI and Blue Ridge had
been called out, while NCRC had been placed on standby. She
compiled a list of further callouts and put them into effect.
More cavers from VPI, a group from CAVES Region, another group
who had been caving at the Friar's Hole Preserve, and the NCRC
rescue seminar left for McClung's. Cavers from Lynchburg and
Greenbrier were not reached, but calls to them were continued.
At about 7:30AM Bob Amundson arrived from Richmond and took over
coordination of the underground search effort. Jackie Redder
assisted him, while Ed Swepston maintained control of the
surface. The first three sweep teams exited through Lightner's
and reported no signs of Dersch.
