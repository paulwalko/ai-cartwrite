As I look back now,
I will remember the
rewards that I
found in that
vacation for the
for the rest of my
life. I recall
looking at
everyone's face in
my lounge just
before we left
Blacksburg, and
thinking to myself
how innocent we all
looked about the
journey ahead. I
also remember
seeing everyone
fifteen days later
in the same room.
Worn and haggard on
the outside, they
slowly trudged in
and sat down, yet
inside of each
person I could see
the good effects of
the trip, and the
growth we all
shared. I think we
are all a bit
closer because of
it.
