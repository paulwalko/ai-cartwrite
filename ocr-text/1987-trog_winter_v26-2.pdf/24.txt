balance. The main problem with the waist strap is that if the
pack gets turned around in a position that is bad, for instance
under you in a belly crawl, it is quite difficult to reposition.
Additionally, it makes taking your pack off a lot slower in an
emergency Suit yourself on this suggestion. Well, enough of
pack stuff;
What do you really need in your car?
1. The TP Roll:
Keep a roll of toilet paper handy in your car. You can blow your
nose on it (I have heard of cavers having "ugly snot" contests on
the way back from Bone-Norman.) You can even use it for toilet
paper, or to clear the fog from the windshield while you are
driving. This stuff is an absolute necessity if you are going to
be away from the house for any time at all.

The Stuff You Have at Home When You Need It Now:
Face it, there are many things you need to have in the car that
haven't managed to get put there. For instance, a can opener
comes in handy when you buy bottles of Molson or Grizzly, which
do not have twist-off tops. And how about the change of socks
and underwear that you always forget? Put those things in the car
now, along with a cooler so you won't have to put up with tepid
beer this Summer. A cork-screw has also come in handy.
I have adopted a philosophy that the car trunk is the ultimate
place to store everything that "might come in handy." Of course,
my car trunk is not a pretty sight. . Moderation in car storage is
preferable, as it is with many things. Despite this, a note of
caution: Never, never forget to bring beer for after the cave
trip. Beer is isotonic and replaces many of the fluids and salts
that you lose while caving. Besides, you might get written up by
the Drinking Techniques Committee for untraditional methods.
The last group of helpful hints in this article will deal
with carbide lamps:
1. Put your spare gasket behind your reflector on your lamp.
Intuitively, it will always be there if your primary gasket falls
through a crack in breakdown.
2. Replace the felt in your lamp with a felt-shaped piece of
dishwashing scrubber (a "scrunge pad".) These do not rot, thus
last practically forever. They even work when wet.
3. Polish your reflector with car wax. You would be surprised
how much brighter your lamp will seem, and it will also protect
the finish so you won't have to buy new reflectors so often.
Well, that's all for this article. Let me know if you have any
new ideas that I should try. I would be happy to review them in
a future article.
