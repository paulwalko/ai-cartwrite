TRICKS of the TRADE
by Jim Washington
In five years of caving, I have experimented with caving
equipment on most of my trips. Here, I will enlighten a few of
you with some new stuff, and a few of you with stuff you already
know and perhaps have forgotten. Some of these things are quite
intuitive, and others really needed a good tryout for me to
decide whether they were any good.
The first category of "experimental" stuff is stuff you might
need in your cave pack.
1.
The Dead Bic Lighter, Tip Cleaner, and Silva on a
Shoestring Trick:
Drill a hole in the Bic and feed the shoestring through it.
To one end, tie on your tip cleaner, and to the other, tie your
Silva Compass. The Bie will provide a spark when you need it.
The Silva is a wonderful aid to sketching; dial in the azimuth,
align the big arrow with north on your sketch, use the millimeter
scale for distance, and your sketch comes out in 25.4 feet to the
inch! Keep this entire assembly in your pack when you are
moving, and hang it around your neck when you stop to survey.
You can always find all three in the dark by feeling around in
your pack for a shoestring. What could be simpler?
2.
The Bottle Trick:
Keep different sizes and shapes of bottles in your pack for
different things. You need a bigger bottle for dump than for
carbide, and still bigger for water if you cannot rely on cave
streams for lamp water. I have found that there is one size of
Nalgene bottle that has a neck opening just a little bigger than
the neck of a carbide lamp bottom. This size bottle helps keep
dump out of the cave environment if you place the neck of the
lamp base inverted in the bottle, then knock the bottle bottom on
a rock. The dump will come out nicely most of the time, and it
saves wear and tear on the lamp base since the bottle will
distribute the shock directly to the sides of the base without
point trauma to one side or the other. For the worst stuck
carbide problems, a toothbrush cleverly stashed in the dump
bottle will work wonders; the handle will remove the carbide, and
the brush can be used to clean the water drip. The best grocery
store-bought bottles for water originally have something edible
in them, for example chocolate syrup, not shampoo. You never get
the soap taste out of a plastic bottle. Glass bottles and
plastic bags are of course out of the question, because they
break or melt (have you ever seen what a hot rack will do to a
ziplock bag?), spilling all contents, creating a moldy mess in
the bottom of your pack, aside from the obvious hazard of broken
glass. If you have to use baby bottles, consider using animal or
cartoon shapes. They are easy to identify without looking. I
always keep "special treats" in my Fred Flintstone. Hip flasks
for water work quite well, although you will need two or more for
a long, dry trip.
