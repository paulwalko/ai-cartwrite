The team led by Charlie Maus (WVACS) went into the cave through
the McClung entrance in order to check the Entrance Passage to
First Breakdown and the leads around the breakdown pile there,
and then to proceed to Second Breakdown, where the sweep team
from the other direction had stopped.
A crew of four led by Jerry Redder (VPI) entered Lightner's to
check southwest from the end of Freeman Avenue to the Echo
Chamber Siphon.
The NCRC people arrived at about 10AM. A Command Post consisting
of a Communications Center, a Staging Area, A Map and Strategy
Area, and a Food Area were immediately set up. Their arrival
brought the number of cavers on site to approximately 75 with
more on the way, making it necessary to organize the operation
personnel in some way. Responsibilities were assigned as
follows:
Surface
Underground
Assistant Underground
Personnel
Communications
Assistant Communications
Staging Area

-- Ed Swepston
-- Bob Amundson
Jackie Redder
-- Chuck Hempel
-- Gene Harrison
Bob Barlow
-- Bob Elrond

Since the search operation now covered two cave entrances, a
Staging Area located across a couple of fields and a road, and a
sizeable Command Center, radios were issued to key personnel
while field phone lines were strung from the Communications
Center to the outside world, across the fields to the McClung
entrance, from this entrance in to First Breakdown, and between
all major points of the central area.
Bob Amundson, with the assistance of Jackie Redder, set up search
patterns that would do two things:
1) divide the cave into "searchable" sections, and
devise levels of search starting with fast sweep searches of
the most likely areas where Dersch could be, progressing to
slow "look-under-every-rock" searches, and finally, simply
filling the cave with cavers standing elbow-to-elbow if
necessary.

Ed Swepston functioned as liaison with local fire departments,
emergency squads and the State Police. Ed arranged for medical
and ambulance support, site security, and food for the searchers
As a result of Ed's work, all supportive site security was
excellent, and the two local CB clubs which overheard our radio
traffic arrived prepared to provide us with hot food donated by
local businesses for the duration of the search. Due to Ed's
effort (combined with the fact that the Command Post was out of
sight of the road), we were able to maintain an extremely low
profile regarding the press and general public throughout the
