on the motivations of caving
by David McClurg
Since I started caving at the beginning of this year, I have
heard various theories about the motivations of caving. For
example,
To go where no man has gone before,
To get away from "normal" life and pursue excitement and
danger,
To prove one's strength, prowess, guts, and masculinity,
To get back to the womb, viz: mother earth or gaea,
are some of the more common. Yet these are naught but sophisms.
Each appeals to mere abstractions, which when critically analyzed
in the most scientific fashion, are easily disposed of. I can
watch Star Trek on T.V. and there are a lot of places man hasn't
gone before, such as the Marianas Trench, which I don't
particularly have any desire to go to. We are all trying to be
different and unique. I also strive for existence beyond my
social security number, but I see my own mortality and I don't
think there is any other thing I can prove. If you want to test
your limits, try running a marathon. Caves are real and cavers
must be realistic. The last theory has some merit, I think. The
allegory of mother earth, and holes in the ground which symbolize
sexual orifices that lead inevitably to the womb, is and
attractive idea. Somewhat askew of this is my own theory. Upon
it, I will explain my insights and understandings.
A:
In each of us, is a heinous, slavering, gollum-like creature
crying out for expression. Once in a cave, I eat vienna sausages
that are surrounded be a clear gelatinous substance. Once in a
cave, I creep, squirm, and crawl through the slimy dark. Why? To
get away from the others, to get away from the healthy living
world. In caves I can find dead rotting animals and a plethora
of thriving bacteria. I can find mountains of bat shit, lakes
and rivers of putrescent mud, empty passages that end in cold
silt filled polls that reflect my depravity.
I am stimulated and excited by the thought of crawling and
sliding down slopes and pits where it is doubtful to ascend back
up. I just want to get to the bottom of a breakdown pile or a
wet hole and sit there giggling in the dark. I do not find you
there, merely my own source of evil. Only there can I quiver
ecstatically over my precious perversions.
Perhaps this is counter-intuitive? No, it is not! In your
self-satisfied over-indulged life have you once experienced the
pain of exquisite and creative torture or the decaying and
wasting away of your body in a concentration camp? That is the
definition of real pain. It cleanses your mind and soul. you
ache for this. Thus also, is your hideous nature truly revealed.
