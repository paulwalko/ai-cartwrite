DTC Report
by Doug Perkins
A year long project, involving experiments at the Banquet, Float
Trip, Nags Head, and the Old Timers Reunion has reestablished the
validity of the old drinking axiom that states:
Whiskey and Beer, Never Fear;
But Beer and Whiskey is Awful Risky!
Participants at these experiments (ok, some would say parties or
even week long binges) all experienced significantly worse
hangovers when drinking hard liquor or upon switching to mixed
drinks midway through the evening. Regular beer drinkers are
particularly at risk when consuming hard liquors as they drink
mixed drinks in the same quantities as beer, but ingest
considerably more alcohol - up to 3 times more per 12 oz.
serving. Want proof? Here 'tis.
Let's use rum, my personal experimental favorite. Rum is
normally 80 proof, or 40% alcohol. If rum constitutes 1/3 of
your mixed drink (and it will likely be more in later hours) then
you cut this 40% by 1/3 and have a drink with 13,3% alcohol. Most
beers barely clear 4%. Obviously, then, beer can be drunk in
larger quantities than mixed drinks (and drinking clearly implies
consumption, not standing around holding a glass and melting
ice-cubes).
The DTC has recognized the need for a railroad siding at the OTR
site in order that we may receive the world's largest beer kegs.
Coors is building railroad tank cars to ship beer to its Virginia
Packaging Plant. These cars are super insulated, allowing them
to make the trip from Colorado to Virginia and only have the brew
warm a degree or two. No refrigeration needed. The exact
figures escape me, but we once estimated that one of these cars
could allow every man, woman and child at the OTR to drink 3
beers an hour for a. 16 hour day for the entire week-end. An even
better idea would be to mate one of these to some sleeping cars
and go tour the country.
The DTC would also like to recommend that those of you interested
in drinking obtain a copy of "The Alcoholic Republic" by W.J.
Rorzbaugh. This book details the drinking habits of Americans
during the Revolutionary War period up to about 1840. This was a
time of impressive drinking, the rate frequently being 3 times
today's levels. An unintended result is that it also exposes the
hysteria about today's levels of alcohol consumption for what is
really is - pure propaganda. Drinking has not increased or
decreased markedly since the Civil War, except for the
Prohibition period, when all the police power the nation could
muster managed to reduce consumption by 2/3, and literally
created organized crime at the same time. Rorzbaugh also gives
his theories as to why drinking decreased in the 1840's, when
Americans began to industrialize. Read it. It'll give you more
to argue over at those late night gatherings.
