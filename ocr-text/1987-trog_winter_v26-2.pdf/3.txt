The President's Column
The club has gained some new members this quarter. Congratu-
lations and thanks to everyone who helped them and to the new
members themselves. We still need to increase our membership
more. If you'd like to help, consider running for an office or
chairing a committee.
Caving's been good this quarter. Club trips have gone to Mexico
and members are planning to bounce Alabama pits over spring
break. After these chances to see caves in other parts of the
country, in 1991 we may have a chance to show the country our
caves. The West Virginia/Virginia region submitted a bid that
the 50th anniversary convention be held here at VPI!
Have a fun spring - go caving, climbing and hiking, but don't
forget to come to the practice rescue this April. We need you
there.
Cave lots and cave safely,
Joan
Johnson
