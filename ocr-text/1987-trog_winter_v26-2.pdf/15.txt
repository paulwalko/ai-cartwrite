The NCRC people, under the direction of Chuck Hempel, set up the
physical layout of the search operations site and provided
internal organization and support in every aspect of the
operation beyond what was covered by Bob and Ed. Because NCRC
had been conducting a rescue seminar, they fully prepared to
handle any medical eventuality, so they were also prepared for
the time when we would find Dersch. The NCRC people had to be
ready for a wide range of possibilities -- Dersch could be in any
condition ranging from being able to exit under his own power to
dead, with the most likely case being that he was extremely
hypothermic and unable to move on his own. NCRC also arranged
for us to be assigned a mission number by the national emergency
agency. This status has been used in the past to fly much-needed
cavers to rescue sites.
At this point, Dersch had been underground for over 18 hours, had
probably been out of light for at least four, and was without
food, water, or adequate clothing. The chances of his becoming
dangerously hypothermic were growing rapidly. If, indeed, he
became severely hypothermic, extricating him from the cave would
present major problems. Getting Dersch to First Breakdown from
pretty much anywhere in the cave would be a major operation due
to the various crawls and climbs involved in negotiating this
cave. The half-mile of canyon passage between First Breakdown
and the McClung entrance would have to be rigged with a high line
(tricky due to the nature of this passage) in order to get a
stretcher out above the canyon and its steep mud banks.
Before any of this was to become a problem, another question
plagued everyone who was at all involved in the strategies:
Where was he? Searchers had been in all passages considered
reachable by Dersch before his light went out -- why hadn't we
found him? The best possibilities remaining were that Dersch:
1) was injured and disabled in a small side lead or down a pit,
2) was somehow still moving around the cave and eluding the
searchers,
3) had somehow gotten into the northern portion of the cave and
was in grave danger due to the rotten and unstable rock
there.
Another major problem of the operation arose at about 3PM when
Bob and Jackie realized that at the rate at which they were
sending in sweep parties, the crew leaders on site (those who
know McClung Cave well: Bob Alderson (Blue Ridge), Charlie Maus
(WVACS) and Jerry Redder (VPI) would soon be burned out and
unable to lead any more trips. They drew up a list of additional
potential leaders to be contacted and brought to the site. There
were only four -- of which, two (Cliff Lindsay and Bill Balfour,
both WVACS) were already on the road, and the other two were not
reachable. There was a real possibility that there were simply
not enough people who know this complex system well enough to
