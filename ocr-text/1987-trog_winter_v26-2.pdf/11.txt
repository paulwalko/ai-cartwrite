SEARCH AND RESCUE OPERATION IN MCCLUNG CAVE
by Chris Amundson
Blue Ridge Grotto
INTRODUCTION
On the weekend of September 13-14, 1986 a group of nine men in
their early twenties traveled from Columbus, Ohio to West Virginia
to go caving. The general experience levels of the group members
amounted to three or four cave trips each. Two members of the
group were climbers who were on their first and second cave trips
ever. None of the group belonged to a grotto, although one of
them is an NSS member.
They planned to split into two parties and enter McClung Cave in
Greenbrier County. One party of five was to go through the
horizontal McClung entrance and travel as far as First Breakdown
and wait for the other group. The second group was to go in the
newly-discovered vertical Lightner entrance and rendezvous with
the first group.
Some of the Ohio group had been in McClung's before -- as far as
First Breakdown. None had ever seen a map of the cave, None had
been in the Lightner entrance or knew the route between the two
entrances. Because their trip plans did not include exiting
through the Lightner entrance, they did not have enough vertical
ascending gear for the whole party. In fact, of the five
entering through Lightner, only two (the climbers) had any
ropework experience at all. Jeff Dersch, the individual who left
his party and was lost, had an electric light, a flashlight, and
some spare batteries. He was dressed in jeans, a long-john shirt
with a short-sleeved canvas shirt over it, and his hard hat. He
had no food, water, or cave pack. The best estimate was that he
would have light until about 6AM Sunday.
CAVE DESCRIPTION
The size and nature of McClung Cave was an important factor in
this search operation. It has over 16 miles of passage, two
major trunk passages, several mazy sections, lots of massive
breakdown, sections of unstable or rotten rock, several short
drops, canyons, and wet areas.
The McClung entrance leads to a room which gives onto the
Entrance Passage: a southwest-trending, 30-foot deep canyon best
negotiated by going above the drop and traversing steep mud
banks. This leads, after about a half a mile, to First
Breakdown. From First Breakdown to Second Breakdown (still in
the Entrance Passage) , a caver must scramble over large blocks
of breakdown in a large passage for nearly three-quarters of a
mile. First and Second Breakdown are both large junction rooms
partially filled with breakdown blocks.
