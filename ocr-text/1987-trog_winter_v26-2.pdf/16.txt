lead the necessary slow search trips. It was decided that if we
were not successful in finding Dersch in the next few hours, we
would have to bring in many more cavers and implement the
elbow-to-elbow approach. This would need fewer leaders of larger
crews and thus reduce the burn-out problem among the leaders.
Because the Lightner entrance is both vertical and tight, it
functioned as a bottleneck and took a lot out of the searchers
entering the cave that way. Not finding Dersch in the most
likely places widened the search area in the cave. Both of these
factors led to the decision to route all search efforts through
the horizontal McClung entrance from this point on. The only
exception to this was that Walt Pirie led a crew of two down
Lightner's to look under every rock as far as the Tufa Room.
A large crew made up of CAVES Region medical personnel and led by
Bob Alderson was formed and sent in to conduct a slow search of
Freeman Avenue in both directions from Batbone Crawl,
particularly checking the numerous short drops along Freeman
Avenue in case Dersch had fallen and was disabled there,
Redder's crew exited the cave and reported no signs of Dersch in
the Echo Siphon area. They also conveyed the information from
Maus' party that the Chocolate Avenue route to the northern part
of the cave could be eliminated from the search area. The
entrance to Chocolate Avenue is a sand bank which clearly shows
footprints -- and is wiped clean after any flooding. There were
no footprints at all at the southwestern end of the Avenue. This
was an important piece of information -- the northern end of
Chocolate Avenue is composed of rotten rock and would be a danger
not only to Dersch if he were there, but also to any searchers
who would have had to go into that section.
Bill Balfour lead a group of three to check the room at the end
of Batbone Crawl and the crawlway off of it to the WVACS Room on
the chance that Dersch had taken that way, thinking it was
Batbone. They would also check the JK Maze near First Breakdown
and from there go through the Wind Tunnel in case he had somehow
managed to get into the dangerous northern portion of the cave.
At about 4:30PM Bob, Jackie, and Chuck decided to call more
cavers in. The rationale was that by midnight there would have
been 80-90 exhausted cavers on site and more bodies would be
needed--especially it the elbow-to-elbow phase had to be put into
effect. In order to get enough cavers on site by midnight, they
had to be called out now. At about 5:15PM Chuck contacted cavers
in baltimore, MD, the D.C. area, Bloomington, IN, and TAG
country. They mobilized and were coming in on government air
transport. GROSS, Parkersburg and other West Virginia and
Virginia grottos were reached and called out.
Maus' party exited through McClungs's and reported no signs of
Dersch.
A very large crew led by Cliff Lindsay was formed to go into the
Seven Fingers area of the cave and drop pairs of cavers at each
