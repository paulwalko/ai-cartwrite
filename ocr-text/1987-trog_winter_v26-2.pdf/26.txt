Everyone is getting settled down after the first gut-wrenching
glimpses of the pit - an awesome hole that made you wonder why in
the world you wanted to do this - especially when the cave
tomorrow promised to be twice as deep. The day is cloudy, though
it appears that the sun is trying to appear, Fog hangs in
patches around us, sometimes actually flowing into the hole from
the peak above, and periodically obscuring the view across the
pit.
12/29/86_- 4 PM - The pit has been "done", and we're back at the
vehicles preparing to head to the next camping spot.
We rigged 4 ropes in the pit - 2 on the high side (780 feet), and
2 on the low side (480 feet). Most people were waiting to rappel
the high side, so I grabbed one of the barely used short ropes
and went down without a wait.
After my early apprehension during the rigging, I felt
amazingly calm going down the rope. The bottom of the pit was
several acres in size. The large opening at the top admitted a
fair amount of light, and much of the bottom was covered with
knee to waist deep broad leafed plants, ferns, and moss. On one
side, a huge hall with an entrance several hundred feet in
diameter sloped steeply downwards. According to maps, we were at
less than half of the total depth of the cave.
Periodically we'd hear disconcerting rushing sounds, like a large
rock or rocks plummeting into the pit at terminal velocity. The
first time I heard it I headed for shelter from rock fall. After
it had happened several times we finally found out that it was
groups of swifts diving into the pit. With wings pulled in
they'd dive into the entrance at high speed - the noise we were
hearing was them braking their descent as they neared the bottom.
I went for speed on the climb out - doing the short side in 19
minutes and a great deal of sweat.
(The group had planned on doing El Sotano de las Golandrinas on
December 30, but a hard rain forced them to change their plans.)
Wednesday 12/31/86 - The sunrise was one of the most breath
taking I've ever seen - over range after range of jagged peaks
with fog filled valleys. The rain has stopped, and there isn't a
cloud in the sky - the pit is on!
11 AM â€“ Sotano de las Golondrinas - We had a hearty breakfast
with yours truly as El Chefo, then packed our gear and made an
hour and a half hike to the pit. An hour of that was on the
road, with a vehicle carrying the gear. The last half hour was
with the gear on our backs (the 2 ropes being carried by 2
porters), down a steep trail through fields, jungle, and dense
bamboo thickets.
Start with a day's rest, a good night's sleep and a hearty
breakfast. Top that with an invigorating walk along the top of
