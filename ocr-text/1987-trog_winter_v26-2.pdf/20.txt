THE BALISTER BAG
by Jackie Redder
Shortly after the MeClungs's rescue in September of 1986, Philip
Balister made a suggestion that could have turned a long search
into a much shorter, easier one.
The idea was surprisingly simple and probably has been used by
other caving groups, but I had never heard of it. I'll call it :
"The Balister Bag". It is to be used in searches where there are
too many side passages in the cave to be manned or not enough
cavers to man the cave junctions.
BALISTER BAG (minimum contents):
1) Ziplock baggie (pint or quart size)
2) Cyalume light stick, activated
trash bag
4) note to the lost caver (instructions to stay put and wear the
trash bag)
BALISTER BAG (additional items):
1)
light source (i.e. - penlight, carbide and water, candle and
matches, etc.)
2)
food
3) specific cave-determined items
The items should all be placed in the Ziplock baggie and the
light stick activated. One Balister Bag should be made up for
each major intersection in the cave. If time or money permits,
more could be made up for side passages or minor intersections.
The search teams would take these in and leave them at the
designated places.
It is hoped that the Cyalume would attract the lost caver and
confine him to one area, making him easier to find. At the
McClung's rescue, it was very possible that we missed the lost
caver more than once. Quite possibly he was down a side passage
looking for the way out and did not hear our voices. With the
Balister bag, he would have been instructed to stay in one place,
making him easier to find than if he was moving about.
The Balister Bags could be made up ahead of time and kept with
the rescue gear.
