9 PM - back in Tomapatz - Paul and I had been the third climbing
team to leave the pit. He was above me and looking to do the
climb as fast as he could. I stayed with him for awhile, but
then he started getting away from me. I did the climb in under
43 minutes, and he was probably 5 minutes ahead.
We got another treat near the top - the swifts returning. They
were coming home in a steady stream as the sun set - circling at
the top and then diving in past us at high speed. The sounds of
all the flapping wings and slowed descents echoed from the walls.
(Note: Like Guaguas, this pá»‹t houses both parakeets and swifts.
The translation of the name, Sotano de las Golondrinas, means
"pit of the swallows". According to the Time-Life book on the
Sierra Madre, it is misnamed, since the birds are actually black
swifts).
I wondered how many of the birds have mis judged and crashed into
the walls, or tried to brake a descent too rapidly - only to
break a wing and plummet to their deaths. There had certainly
been a plentiful supply of bird remains on the floor.
When I reached the top I was given the offer of returning to
Tomapatz early to start dinner for the rest. Since this involved
getting a ride back along the road instead of walking, I jumped
at the chance. So the sweat from the climb had barely dried when
we were off at nearly a run back up the steep trail to the road,
trying to beat the darkness. Darkness fell while we were still
on the trail, but we were in the open fields by then and able to
find our way without lights.
