The Old Duct Tape Trick:
:
It has been said that engineers put stuff together with chicken
wire and duct tape. I have found no useful caving purpose for
chicken wire, but duct tape has found its way onto my list of
necessities. Several times, I have had to do immediate repairs
on lamps with the stuff, or tape a spare light source to a
helmet. I suppose it also would have practical use in medical
emergencies, for taping down a bandanna over a wound, or maybe
for securing a splint. Besides, a roll of duct tape fits
nicely around my dump bottle and takes up very little room in the
pack.

The Ever-popular Food Trick:
Beanee-Weenie, Spaghettios, Lasagna, Vienna Sausages, Roller
Coasters, Chicken Soup, and many, many more gourmet delights are
avail able in pop-top cans. Sometimes, the label comes off and
you get a surprise in addition to the promise of a welcome change
from gorp and candy bars. "Boxed" drinks also cave well. I have
only had one of those explode in my pack, and that was when I was
still carrying bent needle-nose pliers. Consider buying a
stainless steel baby spoon at the grocery store; they are
inexpensive, small enough to throw in the pack, and nearly
indestructible. Use rocks and the can lid for a stove if you
have to use hexamine tabs. The food is good enough cold, and the
hexamine stoves I have seen are not worth the effort. If you
want a hot sandwich, try carrying it in your helmet. It will get
soggy, but should taste fine if you haven't been swimming. Don't
carry unprotected pop-tarts in your pack unless you particularly
enjoy eating a spherical mass of jelly surrounded by an enormous
amount of dry, inedible crumbs. The only fresh fruits larger
than raisins that cave well are firm and have tough skins.
Oranges cave well, and I suppose that pomegranates would, too.
Bananas, pears, and other mushy fruits do not.

A few other Essentials:
No discussion of what to put in your pack is complete without a
list of sorts of the other essentials. Aside from the above and
the three sources of light, you need spare parts for your lamp,
pliers, tip cleaner, tip reamer (keep it in your spare felt), a
plastic garbage bag (Miller bags are the best ; Lawn and Leaf
Bags come a close second), a 30-foot piece of webbing, a
bandanna or two, some sort of first-aid equipment, and a Swiss
Army knife (keep it in a container, or it will be rusted shut
when you need it. )
The last thing about packs I will say here is about waist straps.
Most of you have shoulder packs that dangle about waist level,
waiting for an opportune moment to throw you off balance, get in
the way on a climb, or trip you up while duckwalking. Waist
straps are a partial solution to this. With a waist strap, you
can position the pack in any position you want, and it will stay
close to your body, lessening the chances of throwing you off
