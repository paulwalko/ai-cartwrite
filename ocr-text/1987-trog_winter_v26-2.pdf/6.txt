Leather Industry chose Craig Ferguson as this year's recipient
of their Appreciation Certificate. Mike Futrell was the only
recipient this year of a guano cluster for mapping Wilburn
Valley. Glen Davis was given a plaque certifying him as the
OTR Shit House Engineer. Dave Cinsavich received a 6'x3' card
saying "Just Say No!", since he finally graduated from
substance abuse class. Another victim of substance abuse who
found herself in jail, Sue Setzler, was given a 3'x3' "Get Out
of Jail Free Card," so no one has to come bail her out when
she's going mapping to Stompbottom. Trainee of the Year was
Marvin Fuqua. The "Perpetual" Trainee of the Year was Cecile
Pirie. A Timothy Watson was the Most Obnoxious Trainee.
Cecile was also given a muzzle for her dog, Suki, since she's
been a noticeable element of the wildlife sanctuary, aka the
meetings. Suzanne Danielson's dog, Cory, was eliminated from
the competition due to its resemblance to a rodent. It seems
that no one took the hint, since we've added some new animals
to our meetings on Fridays. Last, but not least our best
drinking cohort and land owner, Buddy Penley was given a
bottle of JD.
It is the consensus of the Grapevine that the Club's favorite

where's your daughter and her cookies.
