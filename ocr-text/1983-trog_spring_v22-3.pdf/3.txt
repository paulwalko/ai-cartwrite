THE ROUSE ROARS
"Soon, elections will be coming up and it will be time to relinquish
this despicable job of chairman to some other harlequin. I hope that my
successor will learn as much about himself and life as I did."
Win Wright

These words of wisdom ring more loudly now. The spring meetings have
gotten off to a rocky start. Some would have us believe that the club is
taking a turn for the worse. I don't believe it. The "old timers" con-
tinue to show up and give us their support. The new membership is full of
gung-ho fools who enjoy crawling, mud and playing lead tape. Jim Washington,
Lawrence Britt and others have proven that the art of cave exploration is
not dead (even if it means digging your own). Practice rescues and other
club projects still bring us together as a strong and unified group.
So what are the problems? In so far as I am concerned, they are no more
numerous or serious than usual. It seems to me that the amount of squawking
is inversely proportional to the amount of caving. The parties are great
for getting smashed and socializing, but the experiences shared underground
(when the going gets tough, the moves dangerous, or an emergency at hand)
are what bring us together and place us a cut above other organizations.
This summer and fall there are a number of things I would like to see
done. Scheduled club trips (eg. Greenville Saltpeter, Hell Hole, Aqua
campground) would help to bring old and new members together and weaken intra-
club factions. Mr. Porterfield has indicated a desire to have the fence
rebuilt around Pighole. Finally, one or two project areas would be an excellent
catalyst for the club. This would involve many members and include ridge-
walking, dyetracing, exploration and mapping. This summer I will be trying to
identify potential areas and establishing the proper land owner relations.
In closing, I would like to commend your safe caving, crazy partying and
remind you that, above all else, we are a caving organization.
