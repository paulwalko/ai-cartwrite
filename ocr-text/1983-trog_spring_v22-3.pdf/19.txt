Carbide Cap Lamp Trade Names
· The list below contains trade-names which may be found on miner's
cap lamps. The mark might vary or even be omitted (unmarked),
but this list is probably the most complete name reference of
interest to collectors. Many thanks go to Henry Pohs, who started
the mine lamp registry several years ago. Most of this list is
from his efforts.

lamp before 1920. The base threads
outside of the water tank and is of the
same style as the Beale Bros., Maple City,
and several other lamps. the DIAMOND has
not been attributed to & manufacturer
