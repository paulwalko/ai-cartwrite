comes out of the cave, tie a rack to it using a short (say a
5 to 20 ft) line. Make sure the end of the main rope is tied
off securely, and rig the rack into it.
That's it! Now the Stokes, carriers, and belayer all travel
down the hill together. Friction is not a problem, the rope
is static. Since it's static, the number of twists and turns
don't matter; take the easy course. Communication is no
longer a problem, the belayer is within conversational dis-
tance. Better yet, he can see what you need - something
belay calls could never do.
From here on creativity rules. A second belayer on the same
rope with a different length of line on his rack could tem-
porarily relieve the main belayer for changeovers (one rope
to another, crossing knots, etc) or when the belayer himself
has to make a tricky move. And a number of shorter ropes
could be rigged at points along the path to eliminate stretch
problems.
Keep your rescue skills sharp, Cave Safely, and maybe Next
Time will be a long time coming. See ya'll in the Fall..
