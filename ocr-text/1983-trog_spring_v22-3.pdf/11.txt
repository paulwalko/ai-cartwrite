New River Rescue Update
I'm sure there are still a lot of people around the
Club who remember the Rescue of January 180. For those who
weren't around (or whose memories don't go back that far),
this was the rescue (real) in New River Cave following the
rescue (practice) earlier the same day in Tawney's. A girl
t'ell on a rock (what else is there to fall on in a cave?)
near the Blowhole, and had to be Stoked out.
Once we got her out of the cave, we still had to get her
down the mountain. The technique we used was a standard one,
but it turned out to be quite unwieldly for this application.
It consisted of setting up a belayer with a rack at a fixed
station near the cave entrance. The end of a long coil of
rope was f'ed through a rack and tied to the head end of the
Stokes. As the Stokes was held off of the ground by half a
dozen cavers, the belayer fed the rope out slowly to keep
them all from sliding down the steep mountainside. This
works very well on short pitches, and indeed, for the first
part of the journey down it worked well here also.
Then we started having troubles :
1. We had to use a straight course down the mountain to
keep the rope from developing friction from: rub points
against trees and rocks. This meant we couldn't always
take the smoothest course.
2. Even running a straight course, friction was still
unavoidably built up against trees, rocks, ground, etc.
The further down we went, the more rope we had to drag.
3. Communication became increasingly difficult. Some-
times a call to the belayer had to be repeated several
times before it was understood. This was particularly
cumbersome when a delicate move (such as a short, steep
bank) was required.
4. Stretch in the rope. By itself, this wouldn't have
been bad. But combined with the friction, we got into
problems where our movement was controlled by S-T-R-E-T-C-H
...SLIP!... S-T-R-E-T-C-H...SLIP! which didn't make for
good control (or a smooth ride for the victim!)
So, what to do? Next Time (with the traffic in New River Cave,
there's always a Next Time), start out by picking an easy
route (for the carriers and the victim) down the hill. Run a
rope down the path, going around as many trees and rocks as
you like. When you come to the end of the rope, tie on
another. Or, better yet, tie it to another tree. Continue
this all the way down the chosen path. Now, when the Stokes
