Resurvey of Simmons-Mingo
"Hey Frank, want to go on a survey trip to Simmons-Mingo?"
"For sure," was my reply. That was stupid!!

My internal clock told me to wake up, or was it. Bob
Carts' ever-present snoring that disturbed my sleep. Manually,
I opened my eye lids with my ragged fingers. I proceeded to drag
myself out of the musty, old sleeping bags left over from the
"fiasco-expedition" some years ago.
I flicked my trusty Tekna-Ãºite and saw five Itrashed'
cavers cuddled up in their cocoons, oblivious to my awakening or
Mike Artz's dense aroma. Here we were, at "Base-camp," a small
but pleasant haven over-populated with rank smelling sleeping
bags, garbage, food and spent carbide dumps, telephone wires,
relay boxes, stoves, fossilized shit, and god knows what else that
was abandoned throughout Simmons-Mingo from the "fiasco." I
dreaded the thought of dragging some of this shit further out of
the cave, as all the survey teams are presently doing, to help
Simmons-Mingo to be, once again, a respectable cave.
My body cried for the sleeping bag, to slip back into
heaven for another hour. But NO!! We must cruise out of the bloody
cave. I do not know if it was "exit fever" or the oncoming
withdrawals from the lack of cold Wiedermanns. Damn, we were 6
hours from the entrance!

That was my second survey adventure into Simmons-Mingo
cave in Mingo, Wy. It was Eric Anderson's third. Mike Artz of
JMU grotto and the PSC'ers from NOVA are currently resurveying
the cave.
Our survey crew, known as Wilburs, Bat Squad Plunkers,
and Pluke the Monkey, usually consisted of Mike Artz (sketch,
the Boss, and 'Fartz'), Bob Carts (Brunton, Boss #2, and snores),
Eric Anderson (lead tape and Wieds) and me (notes, sewer tape,
photographer and asshole) plus one or two other cavers thrown in
for intrests sake.
The average trip lasts for 23 hours and we surveyed
(resurveyed, excuse me) 13001+ of passage, 40-50 stations. We
surveyed between RP2 and Basecamp, which is at least 5 hours of
non-stop caving into Simmons-Mingo!
My first trip into S+M was during Turkey Break; also I
wanted to see if Mike and Bob were ready for a long tour/photo
trip into Ellison's for XMAS vacation. On that particular trip
we found 4001+ of virgin passage with stunning gypsum formations,
including some flowers blossoming 12 inches widel!
Simmons -Mingo is typical of West Virginian caves; friendly,
zooming trunk passage, and decorated with splendid formations.
One spectacular trunk passage has rare mirabilite growing like
weeds.
