I Hate My Camera!
A hilarious site, seeing seven cavers piling out of their
autos and urinating simultaneously on I-81 and I-75 on the way to
Ellison's in Walker County, Georgia. This happened every hour or
so. After swilling a case of warm Wieds and absorbing other
mind altering substances, I can't recall much after arriving in
Lafayette to pick up the campsite keys. Everyone said I had a
good time. :
:.:. This was my ninth trip into Ellison's, Eric Anderson's
second." The greenhorns were Bill Shipman, Knox Worde, Rich Neiser,
Mike Artz (JMU). and Bob Carts (PSC & JMU). Having 7 cavers
with 4 cameras plus 2 pits. (120' + 586'). made the trip into an
unforgettable 30 hour photo/tour marathon. I swore (ha, ha!)
never to bring my camera crap into another cave,
.: .: Shit has hit the fan! I was first to see the entrance,
it had a river flowing into ity that wasn't supposed to be there.
Later in the cave, halfway down Fantastic Pit, my lamp
went out due to the heavy -spray from the waterfall. I 'crashed"
bottom, soaking wet, with garbage bags and all. I was considering
aborting the trip, due to the EXCESS amount of water coming down
the big pit. **Before the final decision, Eric zipped down and
persuaded me to continue the trip. Might as well give everyone
their moneys worth. Besides, caving is the best cure for a
hangover that cheap Kroger coffee can not get rid of.
With the usual mouth-opening, sight-seeing through the
dry galleries, including massive amounts of 25B bulbs exploding
and discharging capacitors, we stumbled into the 'Hall for the
Giants! twelve hours after bottoming-out Fantastic Pit. Hell,
during the summer, my friend Paul Donahue and I cruised the whole
damn cave in 12 hours.
I looked at my camera stuff (ready to 'paint, the big
room) and it smiled back at me. I take care of this pile of
shining metal more than my aching body. I wanted to leave it
behind and let it corrode away. My camera gear, nice and comfy, .
laughed at me.
"Hey Eric, open!" FLASH!! Wow, that one lit up the
whole room. "Eric, closed.".
"Eric, open!" FLASH! Damn, that one was awsome, totally
awsome! I thought I saw God. "Er√Øc, closed!"
. With the photo-taking and sight seeing out of the way,
we cruised' back to the big pit in 3 hours. Now that's caving.
I went up Fantastic Pit, solo, since I was the "odd" person.
Everyone else cammed up tandom. The waterfall seemed to have
increased its output, probably due to the thawing of the ground
surface. I had no one to pull the the rope out of the waterfall,
So I felt like a saturated sponge once out of the spray, halfway
up the pit. I was in utter blackness the whole 586feet, since
my carbide lamp once again was soaked and useless. My Tekna-
Lite decided to quit on me when I needed it mosti Occasionally
I saw a miniscule source of light peering up from the bottom
