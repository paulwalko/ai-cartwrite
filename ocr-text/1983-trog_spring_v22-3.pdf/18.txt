ANALYSIS:
To cave for fun and profit is not as difficult as
many would believe. Just go to a cave where lots of people
with wallets go. New River Cave, for example (major example).
Then check out the areas where wallets and billfolds may have
fallen or otherwise ended up. This includes areas that are too
tight, too wet, or otherwise too virgin. Be sure to investigate
pack-rat nests, too. And do check for possessive Neotoma first.
Notice that in the two cases presented, the goods
were returned to their rightful owners. Depending on your
financial position, you may want to follow their example. Make
at least a reasonable attempt to do so. Happy caving, and may
you find a fortune under the next rock you overturn.
