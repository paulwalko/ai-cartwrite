** Grotto Grapeviness
At the begining of this quarter Tuesday saw most of us back
for the first day of classes and a first day of classes party
at Becky's Wednesday night the club made themselves obnoxious
in the back row of Squires theater for a viewing (reviewing) of
"Das Boot". Thursday was a paint the Easter Beers party at
Quiche's. The usual party followed the Friday night meeting
with numerous casualties. Saturday we had the Easter Beer Hunt
and party at Redder's. It was definately going to be a good
quarter, QCAs disregarded.
Over Springi break Stymie, Quiche, Ann Marie, Steve Lancaster,
John MacDowall, and Mark Honosky canoed the Greenbriar River'.
They enjoyed 5 days of flood, sleet, snow, bitter cold, and .
massive partying. The Alabama trip fizzeled down to 5 people.
About the only thing accomplished was the discovery of an enjoyable
way to ride with The Rouse driving - Drunk.
The club softball team had a winning season (3-1) and made
it to the first round of the International Playoffs. The
volleyball team also had a good time ending with about (2-22).
Cave Clubbers argue constantly over the club's money -
how to spend or horde it. Well, at least it's not being ignored.
Kent Thompson and Co. once again pulled us through the
Miller Campain with the club taking 4th and about $500 prize.
Lawrence sold his Willis, bought a NON-4 wheel drive Nova,
and destroyed the Honco by melting the ignition wires and starter
solenoid, throwing a U-joint, and slinging the starter into 40
plus peices. And he still drove it homel Futrell bought Frank
Gibson's old cave-mobile and subsequently had the breaks fail
after trying to 4-wheel through West Virginia while Kehole hunting.
Frank bought a hot new 4-WD mobile and disappeared, only to
return with new cameras for some of the best photos ever. Watch
for his slide shows in the fall.
Cavers have been spending spring days rock climbing, but a
few trips did go out. The 20's have about 1.5 miles in Newberry's.
Lawrence has about 1.7 miles in Starnes. Jim Hixson has found
enough suckers from VPI to start back mapping in Windy Mouth.
Win, Stymie, Quiche, Capt. Ed, Foulup, and Hogwood picked a
rainy weekend to finish the waterfall pit in Bane's Spring; tough
guys, huh? During picnic the fearfull four took a nostalgia trip
to Buddy's for a case of Dejavue. Also over picnic weekend
Bill Stevens, Didly, Win, Bob Alderson, Richard Cobb, and Jeff
Hedges went out cave rat passage in Spring Hollow with the
scaling pole. Didly free climbed up to the lead, found nothing,
and had a hard time getting down.
The club carried out another successful plastic rescue in
new river.
Elections went as usual with 2 good hours of mudslinging.
Keith and Kent are graduating and have no idea what to do next.
Sue Sue and Rick are engaged. Richard and Pat are moving back
to Blacksburg. Karen Michelsonis a raft guide on the Chattooga
River in s.c. Chuck finished and defended his thesis. Rick
and Binny are getting married in July. Pete and Linda are having
a 4th of July party in Rack Hill S.C. And the Bonenbergers have
multiplied with a 92 lb daughter, Andrea Kay.
