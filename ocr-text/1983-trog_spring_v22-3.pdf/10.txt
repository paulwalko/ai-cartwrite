SLAUGHTERPEN CAVE
On May 22, 1983 Jack Kehoe and I set out for the Falls Ridge Nature
Preserve near Ironto to check on a number of sinkholes on top of the ridges
there. After much bushwacking and hillclimbing a small cave entrance was
located' by Jack on the ridge above Slaughterpen Hollow. Way out in the
:: boonies, completely unreported and developed in dolomite â€“ both Jack and
I were highly sceptical.: With carbide lamp in hand (we had not planned to
go caving) I proceeded headfirst down a rocky crawlway slanted at about 30
degrees. : On my belly and with an "interesting" maneuver ahead I decided
that I had seen enough and came back out. Jack then gave it a try only to:
respond in identical fashion, "It goes but...". Since it was highly unlikely
that we would return I found it nescessary to crawl back in to confirm that
the lead did indeed die. Instead, the passage continued, finally opening
up into a fair sized room with a small pit. I then scrambled back to the
surface to tell Jack of the good news.
On May 28, 1983 Jack Kehoe, Suzanne Danielson and myself returned to
Slaughterpen Cave with the intent of mapping from the start. All of us being
novices at this sort of thing, we had some difficulty, particularly in the
begining. Jack, as brunton reader, was made to undergo all sorts of contor-
tions while taking readings in the steeply dipping crawlway. Suzanne ques-
tioned the sanity of holding lamp on station while dangling out over a piti
And all the while I sat back and pondered at how cushy a job the sketchman
had. The pit turned out to be 18 feet deep and blind. A passage to the left .
led to another small, blind pit. Mapping across the first pit we soon
encountered a rather large canyon trending upslope and to the right. This
soon died except for a possible high lead that could be seen some 25 feet
above. Six hours later the mapping was completed and we exited the cave.
.
The next day Jack got it in his head to try and draw up the cave for
the Trog (the deadline was two days earlier). And so, through a combined
effort, we were able to crank out a sketch in very short order. Its no
Spring Hollow but perhaps next time......
