CASE I, Exhibit 1
Dear Mr. Ulfers:
I have never been as shocked as I was upon opening the package
you sent and staring at a small piece of my past. The incident of
the lost billfold has been a story I have told many times during the
last fourteen years. But the ending which you have provided will
make the tale absolutely incredible.
In 1968 I was a student at V.P.I. While neither I nor my
roommate, Russ White, were.. members of the Cave Club, we existed
on the fringes of its membership. We were friends with several
members and used the maps of the club. We were not avid cavers,
but we had developed enough skill so as not to get hurt, and. we
explored caves a couple of times a month. One day in the Fall of
1968 we decided to climb (crawl?) to the waterfall in New River
Cave. It was our custom to leave our valuables in the mouth of
a cave so that we wouldn't have to worry about losing them. We
placed the valuables beside a rock and went into the cave. As I
recall, we reached the waterfall and signed the registration book.
(If you get back into the cave again, and if they haven't changed
that book, I'd like to know the exact date we were there.) When
we returned to the mouth of the cave, Rusty's wallet was there, but
mine was gone. We searched every square centimeter of that entrance
room. No billfold. We theorized that a packrat was living in
the cave and had borrowed my wallet for whatever reason packrats
do such things. Man, was that a pain trying to cancel those credit
cards and get duplicates of all my papers. I had written them
off many years ago.
Thank you so very much for sending the billfold to me. You
have brought back many beautiful memories.
(Signed)

CASE II:
In Which Frank Gibson Says, "Aha!"
Ed Fortney: On October 16, 1982, I led a clean-up trip in New
River Cave. With me were Frank Gibson, Al Ostrowski, Marie Schall,
Teresa Walker, Jim Jeweler, and Sheon Marriner. On the way back
from the Falls, we stopped at the bottom of the China Slide to
pick up some trash. Frank Gibson checked out a stream passage
nearby. A few minutes later, we heard a somewhat muffled "Aha!"
Frank was yelling something about a wallet with fifty dollars in
it. We all said, "Yeah, yeah, ha-ha good joke," until he arrived
back where we were with this wallet.
In the wallet we found, as I remember, a five, a
fifty, several signed, endorsed checks, Mastercard, Visa, and an
airline credit card. The total on the cash and checks was a
whopping three thousand five hundred fifty-five dollars.
Frank returned the wallet to its owner, who said that
he would buy the club a keg, but we haven't heard from him since.
