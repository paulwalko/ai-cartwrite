When in the course of TROG editorship we encounter. odd.
things happening in caves, we feel it our journalistic duty
to report the facts as they come. There is no gold in our
local caves, but recently we have heard reports about the
discovery of hitherto unmentioned caches of MONEY. Two cases
have come to light, and we are pleased to present these cases
for the first time anywhere. We call this section:

CASE I:
In Which Bob Ulfers Rat-Holes in New River Cave
Bob Ulfers: In March of 1982, during finals week, I decided
to explore the entrance to New River. Since I had no one to
go with, I did not go beyond where sunlight could still be
seen. While looking in between rocks to find a place into
which I could squeeze myself, I found a hole that, although
too small for me to pass through, seemed to get larger as it
went down. I tried to cram through it. With my shoulders
and head through, I could see clearly only that it went on
and down. Then, I backed out and enlarged the hole by remov-
ing some of the dirt and rocks. While digging, I found a
Swiss Army knife about a foot down.
Soon, the hole was big enough, and I could lower
myself into it. As I touched bottom with the tips of my boots,
I heard the crunching of dry twigs. In a crouching position,
I finally got a good look at this small room. The first thing
I noticed was an inactive pack rat nest with its attendant
trash: shoelaces, gloves, beer cans, string, etc.
Then, I looked down to my feet and saw an old,
dusty billfold. It had been chewed up at one corner and was
revealing some green paper. MONEY!?!?! I opened it in a
hurry. It was filled with credit cards, ID's, papers, pictures,
and various other cards. I looked for money, but my heart
was humbled to find only two one-dollar bills, one of which
had been semi-chewed up by pack rats.
A couple of days later, I sent it all to the ad-
dress on the driver's license. Still later in March, I
received an interesting letter (Exhibit 1).
