S&M does lack one characteristic; she has no vertical
pits to YO-YO. But she does make up for her lack of potholes with
diverse caving to Basecamp and beyond. She requires stamina from
the caver with 5 or 6 free-climbs, running passages, vertical
crawls, boulder hopping, swimming, sleeze-bag crawls, and adequate
pit stops.
After 4 hours of caving through dry galleries, we hit
upon a roaring stream (shin to 'nad' deep, depending on the
season) that we had to wade through for 2 hour. Very enjoyable;
it cools you down. The music by the stream breaks the monotony
of a dry cave system. I hear that the cave gets super sleazy
(sounds fun) past Basecamp, near the Oil Drum Falls and towards
the second entrance (a possible through trip). We are hoping to
survey that part of the cave in the future. For now, I'm just
getting into surveying, and I love it. I hope to get more involved
in surveying and to lead trips into S&M with other VPI cavers.

After putting away my camera, we started once again the
relentless pace towards the entrance. Instead of guide numbers
and f-stops, I concentrated on putting my right foot forward, then
bringing my left foot forward, and holding in the shit until we
were out (too bad it never works that way). We all can hear the
cold beers whimpering to be had at the entrance. At one point in
the cave, we were 550 feet below the entrance, impressive for a
cave that has never seen a PMI rack nor Gibbs.
Having Mike Artz lead the way out is non-stop, bust-ass
caving. I'm sure glad that. I jog frequently. I was very suspicious
(but secretly glad) of the frequent carbide change stops on the
way out. Praise the Lord that we all did not own Wheat Lamps.

Just as the night before the cave trip, we partied
notoriously hard afterwards. In a comatose state, I barely crawled
into Mike's tent. I could not remember if I was wasted from the
caving trip, or if it was from the ludicrous amounts of beer
and those imported herbs. But it sure felt good.

"Hey, Frank, want to go caving in Simmons-Mingo
"For sure," was my reply, "For sure.
again?"
