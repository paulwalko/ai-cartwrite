test was complete, I spilled some water into the
same bowl. I think. “Uh-oh. Glad there isn't any
open flame around.” Within a few seconds lighters
shoot forward, and the bowl is ablaze. Silly me, I
had worried about the heat of the water-carbide re-
action melting the plastic. I should have foreseen
that in a room full of cavers, someone would have
to throw fire into the equation. Luckily the flames
are put out before someone can think to thrown in
some of the firecrackers lying around.
The only thing left for me is tying the seat to
the Vice President's satisfaction. I remember how
the intricacies of the square knot had once given
me no end of trouble, but no longer. But I still tri-
ple checked everything. Normally I'd also have to
demonstrate the 14 or so require knots, but I'd got-
ten that signed off next semester. (Shot through
time, did you? -Ed.) So really, there's nothing left
for me to do except relax. I sit back and watch stu-
pid carbide tricks. Well, actually they were quite
cool. If you have never thought to put carbide in a
half empty beer can and the light the foam that rises
up, you are really missing something. Personally. I
found this just as entertaining as a lava lamp. But
then again, I was feeling a bit hypothermic.
The party ends, the test is over, I've passed.
Returning home, I'm glad it's finally behind me.
Tomorrow I'll do my belay test, and then the only
thing between me and endorsement for member-
ship will be that pesky Trog article.
