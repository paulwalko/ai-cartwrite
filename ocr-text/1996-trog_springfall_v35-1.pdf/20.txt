TECH TROGLODYTE ARTICLE
by Chris Rourke
It was 7:30 am when the sound of my alarm
jerked me into consciousness. My first thought
about the upcoming day: my membership test. My
second though: uh-oh, gotta go to class first, better
get up. My third thought: hmm, September 18.
Isn't that more than just test day? Oh yeah, I nearly
forgot.... it's also my birthday. Well, I've had plenty
of birthdays, so there's not much mystery left in
them. On the other hand, few trainees have seen
first-hand the secret rites of the membership test.
The night before, I put some effort into studying
for it, relearning a few knots and repairing the bro-
ken striker on my lamp. I think I've learned most of
the important stuff in the Trainee Trog. Nothing
left to do now but get through the easy part of the
day.
After I got back from class, I dug up my sign-
off sheets. For a few panicked minutes I thought I'd
lost them both. This would be bad. Very bad. But,
with enough searching, you can find almost any
thing in my room. (How 'bout some common
sense? -Ed.) The sheets finally show up. Hmm, only
33 hours of caving signed off. The last trip I got re-
corded was way back in October. So I probably had
my 40 hours underground after two months of cav-
ing. It's the other requirements that have kept me a
trainee since then. If I'd know better last fall, I
would have jumped at any chance to get cable lad-
der belay or changeover signed off
John Deighan took the test along with me. I
had thought he planned to remain the ultimate
trainee for all eternity (So far the record is 14 years.
-Ed.), but it seems he finally stopped losing his sign
off sheets and is ready to join the elite ranks of
membership. He picked me up at 5:00, and we set
off to complete the most important requirement of
the membership test: we buy beer. Traditionally,
beer is used to simulate the disorientation and con-
fusion of hypothermia. If a prospective member
doesn't drink, they shouldn't worry; they can stay
sober. It's far more important that the members at-
tending the test get to simulate hypothermia.
James was kind enough to let us hold the
test at his house. Since he lives at the Sign-Out
apartments, there was a ready supply of members
to drop by and hassle us. We arrived at 5:30. That's
a bit early, but no one wants to stay up to 4:00 am
on a Wednesday night. We both began the written
test right away. I had expected a few pages of mul-
tiple choice questions. I was wrong. Many long
pages, mostly with free answer or fill in the blank.
It takes me aboạt 3 hours to finish; longer times are
not uncommon. The answers were not all obvious.
A lot of the required information I had known once
and forgotten. Some of it I had never heard of. If I
shared specifics it would ruin the fun of it all for fu-
ture testees, but I will give a couple of hints. First,
make sure you drain the Trog of every usable drop
of info. It's not just filler; all of it is useful. Second,
go to Banquet. It's a good way to learn the legends
and lore of the club. I missed it last year and it
probably cost me 15 points or so. Also, value any
gift of knowledge a member should see fit to be-
stow upon you. If someone happens to mention
that the rated strength of PMI is 6800 lbs, they're
probably not just saying it to show off their powers
of memorization. They're giving you a useful bit of
information, which will be handy to know some-
time down the road.
Taking the written test was just the begin-
ning. The real fun is when it gets graded. I turned
the test over to Nathan, and the carnage began. I
had expected Nathan, as VP, to be hard on me. But
I thought I could count on sympathy and support
from the other members, especially those who
were in my shoes a short time ago. Ha ha ha! It
seems that they still have the trauma of their test
still fresh in their minds, and want to ensure that
you won't get off any easier than they did. “I got
that one wrong, so you should too.” Actually, the
grading process gives you a chance to explain and
elaborate on your answers. When it's all over, I've
learned a great deal. For example, now I know that
it is not considered an acceptable caving practice to
lob carbide bombs into pits to wake members who
have fallen asleep. Not even little carbide bombs.
Also, having a trainee go first through a long wet
crawl to sop up all the water so that you stay dry is
not the proper method of staying warm. (Says who?
-Ed.) Oh well, live and learn. The minuses added
up, and for a moment, I thought I might fail the
written. Then I realized there was a total of nearly
200 points.... not 100 as I had thought. Phew.
Next, the lamp test. I've always wondered
why the lamp test took others so long. 11 minutes
to reassemble and light a carbide lamp seems un-
reasonable. Even hypothermic I figured I could
manage it in 6. Ha. Wrong again. I won't reveal
many of the great joys of the test, except that they
are out to get you. Or at least they were out to get
me. Which helps explain why it took me over 20
minutes to get my lamp going. I plan to make my-
self feel better for this poor performance by taking
revenge against the poor trainee I see taking the
lamp test. Only if they take over half an hour will I
be satisfied. While I was filling my base, I spilled a
few carbide rocks into a plastic bowl. Then, after I
