"Hector, where are you?” I was becoming ex-
asperated with Hector because he usually comes so
quickly for dinner.
"You must still be outside, you curious little
devil.” I probe around the front yard, but Hector is
nowhere to be found! And worse yet, the board
which covered the hole in the yard was misplaced!
I reached my arm down the hole, trying desperately
to grab Hector, but I couldn't touch the bottom. I
went back inside to try and find a flashlight in my
bunch of boxes.
I took the tiny flashlight to the hole and
shone it into the hole. For some reason I could not
see the bottom. Reaching my hand down farther, I
accidentally dropped the flashlight did not hear a
clunk or thud. Worried, I decided to call the fire
department...this was no one man job. Lacking a
phone book I decided to drive quickly to the small
fire department.
"Howdy, what can I do fer ya tonight?” the
man said lazily
"My cat! My Hector fell down a hole in the
front yard and he, I can't hear him and my flash-
light, dropped and my poor Hector!"
“Um, calm down Sir-you say your cat fell
down a hole in your front yard?”
“YES!”
"Well, where do you live?”
"The old brick house on Cow Kamp Corner
Lane"
“Uh...Oh!"
“What?"
"Well, see, I prolly shudn't say nuthin’; but
uh, yer livin on toppa thuh deepest hole this side
uh Bear Mountain!"
"WHAT?!"
"Yap, uh, you sittin' right on toppa a cave..."
"And WHY did no one mention this before?"
"Well, uh, truthfully Sir, there ain't much
money in this here town, and the Realtor guy, Si-
mon, he said if we kept our mouths shut, he'd
make sure we didn't go hungry, if ya know what I
mean."
"I was sold inferior property and everyone
just stood by! My Hector, my Hector has fallen
down this...hole, this cave of sorts.”
"Yup, sounds to me like we're just gonna
have to call VPI.”
“VPI? Who, what is that?"
"They're the cavin people from the College
of Virginia Tech...they'll get yer can fer ya, if n he's
not dead”
"DEAD!! Oh, no!"
"Oh, thank the lord you're finally here!” I
shouted with exasperation as they drove up.
They all piled out of their cars with muddy
clothes and funny jumpsuits. They carried lots of
metal equipment and ropes.
"It looks like you don't have any trees to tie
in to...we were wondering if we could look in your
house for a sturdy rig point," one of them, she
seemed like the leader, mumbled to me.
"Rig point? Um...sure, come right in" I said
with reluctance, noting how awfully muddy they
were. Good thing I don't have carpets.
“Now, we've taken a look at your hole, and
even though it's small we're going to run a rope
down it, because it might widen out down further,
and it looks pretty vertical,” she said
"Well, whatever you must do...but you aren't
going in there without me.”
“What? I mean, that would be very unsafe for
you” one of the boys said nervously.
I didn't know why they didn't want me to go
in my own cave...it could be they want to hide some
secret from me. I can't let them go down there and
wait like some dunce while my poor Hector stum-
bles about in the dark. They started to feed the
rope down the hole.
"Now we believe there's another entrance to
this cave...but the landowner is known to shoot at
anyone who tries to go near it. We wanted to know
if you knew this guy, and if you could talk to him”
"Heavens no! I'm not going anywhere where
someone tries to shoot at me!” What were they
thinking, I just moved in here! “And don't think of
letting anyone down there until you've suited me
up to go as well!"
"I think that's what you'd best do if you want
to cave in this county again. This is this man’s prop-
erty, and this man's cave.” The fire chief agreed
with me.
"Well...we'll give you a quick lesson and you
might be able to go, if the people who go down first
determine that it's safe.”
"You'd best do so!" Hmpf! Them not letting
me into my own cave to see my own Hector.
