EDITOR'S NOTE
by the Editor
(who did you expect?)
The Trog Editor will from this issue forward
accept only those articles typed into a word proces-
sor and saved onto a disk or typed hard copies. In
this day and age, in this college town, I'm certain
that everyone has access to a computer. I will lend
a 374" floppy disk to anyone who asks nicely.
Enough grousing. Hope you enjoy this spe-
cial double issue.
Welcome to the Trog's first double issue!
You'll find that this issue is no different
from any other. The reason is this: though I have
produced late issues of the Trog, I have yet to skip
a semester completely. As there was very little ma-
terial to fill the Spring '96 issue, I have combined it
with the Fall '96 issue in order to assuage my guilty
conscience and keep my record as Editor free of
missed issues. Thank you for humoring me.
As usual, the Trog is looking for articles, trip
reports, and anything else vaguely cave-related to
take up some space. If you know someone who has
an aunt whose best friend's husband's elderly dog
wants to submit an article, please let me know.
Especially helpful is any drawings that you
may have. I can fill this thing will cartoons if need
be, but I'd like to see some of you artistically in-
clined folks submit some drawings of cave stuff.
