cautioning himself to be careful and not drop the
webbing. This was ironic because that is exactly
what he did. Just as one end of the webbing was in
our reach, the other end came tumbling down. As
a result, Wells had to down-climb the second pitch
and we still had a tough time lobbing his webbing
back up to him. We did get it up to him though and
he belayed us up to the first ledge. Once we were
both safely off belay, Lepera and I gave Wells a
good-natured ribbing for such a butter-fingered
maneuver.

Now we were free to confront the problem
of the running water noise. We returned to Seven
Second Pit to find a small waterfall occupying the
same space as our rope. This meant a thorough
drenching for anyone who ascended the rope. On
the bright side the sumps did not seem to be rising
in any sort of threatening manner. Before we could
ascend though, we had to check a lead that in-
volved climbing over a deep spot in the nearby
sumps. Lepera volunteered. The lead did not go,
but by continuing upward he made it to a level in
the pit above the waterfall. Wells and I would have
followed him to avoid the water, but we saw that
the peanut butter consistency mud he climbed
through left him in a fairly gross condition. Instead
we each took our turns getting soaked on rope.
Once we had ascended up to the level Lepera was
at only one lead remained to be checked. It was a
chimney also covered with the same gross mud,
and it had a rock the size of a spare tire wedged in
it. I tried climbing it first, but the thick mud com-
bined with end of the trip apathy kept me out.
Wells forced his way up into the chimney and dis-
lodged the rock. It landed only a couple feet away
from Lepera and I because we really did not have a
place to get out of rockfall. The lead did not go.
Having accomplished our goal of wrapping up Sey-
en Second Pit we headed for the entrance. Just as
we approached the Straddle Pits we felt a cold wind
gusting into the cave. It was also possible to hear it
moaning up at the top of the entrance pit, letting
us know that the weather had turned pretty nasty.
It was then that Steve and Steve came up with a
wonderful plan. I would exit the cave first and
warm up the truck, they would follow a short time
later and de-rig the rope from the entrance. I
agreed and headed out. When I got to the bottom
of the entrance pit I discovered a sub-freezing wind
gusting straight down and carrying flakes of snow.
For once I was glad that the pit is ninety feet deep
because after climbing that distance I had just bare-
ly warmed up. I paused to take a breather at the top
of the pit when suddenly I realized that my climb-
ing knots were freezing to the main line. As soon as
I had them off the rope they stiffened with ice. I
made my way out of the trees that protect the top
of the sinkhole and was momentarily shocked by
what I saw. The whole landscape was white, and
the high winds were carrying snowflakes horizon-
tally across it. Somewhere in that whit blur, was my
white truck.
I plunged into the storm with high hopes. Af-
ter a minute I spotted the lights from the Seizer's
house and navigated by those. After many more
minutes my cave suit was frozen stiff and my ex-
tremities were going numb. I told myself that if I
did not find the truck soon I would have to head for
From there we chimneyed straight up into
an area where more and more chert projected from
the walls. We surveyed as we progressed upward al-
ternating plum bob measurements and ugly high
angle shots. We reached the termination of this
climbing passage and took the last shots. As we
were doing this I heard a noise that I had not heard
before, the sound of running water. Being junior
member on the survey team and not wanting to
seem foolish for not noticing it before, I kept my
mouth shut. Then Steve Lepera asked, “Have we
been hearing that water the whole time?” We decid-
ed that we had not and that made us a bit nervous
because it meant that the sumps might be rising
and we had to pass the sumps to get back to the
bottom of Seven Second Pit. First, however, we had
to get back down. The descent went relatively
smoothly until the bottom twenty foot climb. Lep-
era and I made it down with a belay from Wells.
Wells then descended using doubled webbing as a
handline. The problem arose when the pull-down
rig did not pull down. After all three of us had
weighted one end of the webbing and then the oth-
er we decided that the water knot attaching one
sling to the other was stuck pretty good. Wells
climbed back up to rig the pull-down in a different
place. Unfortunately when he got up to the top he
did not find any suitable spot other than the sticky
one we had used before. After some deliberation
Wells pasted the loop of webbing behind a tiny
nubbin of rock that slightly projected upward. If
you really want to know how tiny it was you can ask
him yourself. All I know is that he descended the
climb trying to not "really put his weight on the
handline. Needless to say, we had no trouble pull-
ing the webbing down this time.
