This banquet's recipient of the A.I. Cart-
wright award went to Joe Zokaites for his many
years of surveying, trip leading, and involvement
with the club. This award is the most meaningful
one bestowed by VPI. Joe has been loyal to the club
for many years and has been peeking down dresses
at banquets for just as long,
A group of EMT students decided to award
their own honors. Jackie Hoell was given an in-
scribed mug for her ceaseless efforts to medically
train members of our club. Cavers aren't the only
ones who recognize her value. See "Special An-
nouncements” in this issue.
Doug Perkins and Craig Ferguson kept the
music playing until the wee hours and the dancing
helped to drive the cold away.
Banquet '97 will take place once again at the
Rec Center, and Steve Williams has been secured as
Chef Extraordinaire. Keep your ears open for par-
ticulars.
The Halloween party was once again held at
the Bat Ranch. Attendance was a bit lower than in
previous years, but there was no lack of fun. Many
hit the dance barn or milled about by the food ta-
bles inside. The Village People performed a num-
ber for the cheering audience, and in most cases
managed to make the “C” in YMCA the right way. It
wasn't until later that we discovered it was not the
original group but actually imposters from the Elvis
Grotto.
Darth Vader ran around zapping people
with his television remote, and Thing One and
Thing Two ambled through the house but didn't
seem to be cleaning anything. There were ghouls.
fortune tellers, wizards, and a large band of insects
flitting about. Good thing there were no giant fly
swatters in attendance.
Most everyone has heard about Bobby Zo-
kaites' skiing accident which broke his neck. Good
thing Momma Zo was fast on the scene to make
sure he was handled properly. Doctors expect he'll
be running around like his usual energetic self in
just a few months. The club sends him best wishes
for a speedy recovery.
As for business, next semester the club files
will be turned over to Lawrence Britt and housed
in his new abode on Penn Street.
Suzie Warren, club Prez, is planning to re-
new the club's recycling efforts to raise a bit of
money. Given the amount of aluminum that cayers
generate, this should add nicely to the club funds.
What a great way to profit from our "hobby”!
The club voted to adopt a rental system for
the club tarp. See the rental form in this issue. The
tarp will live on Penn Street with Lawrence
That's it for the local news. Thank you and
good night.
