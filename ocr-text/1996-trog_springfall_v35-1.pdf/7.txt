VPI CAVE CLUB
TARP RENTAL RULES
written by Lawrence Britt
The following are the rules that have been adopted for rental of the club tarp.
* Any full or associate member of the club may petition the club for rental. These requests
must be made in person at an official club meeting. A quorum must be present and the
request must be approved by a simple majority of the voting members. There is no other way
to obtain the tarp except during Christmas and summer breaks when the holder of the tarp
can give permission.
* The rental fee of $20.00 is payable to the treasurer before the tarp may be picked up. This
fee is good for up to three days of use. A fourth day would require another $20.00 fee.
* The tarp must be returned within three days of event conclusion
* Any loss of, or damage to, the tarp, poles, connectors, stakes, lines, or bags is the immediate
responsibility of the renter, even if they rented the tarp for someone else. The renter must
pay the full replacement cost of the lost or damaged parts as soon as the bill is available.
* A signed rental form is required.
* These rules and fecs have been voted on and passed by a simple majority vote. No
individual may bend these rules or be granted special favor.
