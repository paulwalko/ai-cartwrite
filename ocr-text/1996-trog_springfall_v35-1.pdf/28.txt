The numbering system started in Fall 1964.
Members before Fall 1963 are not included unless
they returned as dues paying members after that
date. Many early numbers were not given in chro-
nological order.
This roll book is the second of it's kind, with
the first 340 members carried over from the origi-
nal book. The original book covered from Fall 1963
until Fall 1992. This book replaced the old one in
the Spring of 1993.
