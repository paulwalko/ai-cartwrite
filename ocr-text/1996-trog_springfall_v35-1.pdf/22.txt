GROTTO GRAPEVINE
by A.I. Cartwright and Associates
This grapevine opens with a bit of sad news.
This summer Pam Mohr's mother passed away after
many months spent in the hospital. Family and
friends are saddened but relieved that the suffering
has ended. Dick Burns, a long-time caver known to
VPI for many years, also passed away this summer
in a retirement home.
Don Davison, mentioned in a previous Trog
as being missing, is now officially listed as deceased
when he failed to return from his climbing expedi-
tion and rescue efforts were halted.
Now let's look to beginnings. The Saturday
after Old Timer's, Erica Frieburger and Matt Seigler
got hitched in a lovely ceremony at Virginia Tech's
Chapel. The bride and groom hosted the reception
at the Red Lion Inn, complete with caricature fris-
bees and a declaration from the bride's father that,
"Cavers rescue Spelunkers.” Matt and Erica had the
foresight to host their reception at a motel so
"tired” guests had only to maneuver themselves to
their rooms before passing out.
Paul Kirchman and Dabney Hammer mar-
ried in March in the Charlottesville home where
Dabney grew up. The bride was momentarily held
hostage by the groom with the aide of the cake-cut-
ting knife, but he soon realized that the advancing
crowd really wanted a taste of the ice cream. The
afternoon was followed up with bubble-blowing in
the hall while the kids (read: Paul) tried to catch
them on their tongues.
Float Trip regular Father Nature, a.k.a. Ed
Day, was recently busted for marijuana possession.
No reports on his fate as yet.
This year's Picnic was, not surprisingly, wet
for a day. The rain did clear up for Saturday
evening so people could come out from under
their tarps.
Pete Sauvigne delighted some and repelled
others with his Chinese lizard wine. The nasty taste
was only made up for by the sight of dead lizards
and snakes floating towards you as you tipped the
jug to your lips. (The remains of this concoction
made its way to OTR where it circulated, leaving
hands tainted for hours by the stench.)
What to do with those pesky left-over 2 liter
bottles of soda at Picnic? Well, wonder no more.
Some clever folks discovered that plastic bottles
full of carbonation, if kicked and tossed against the
rocks long enough, would explode in a spray of
stickiness onto unfortunate viewers. The soda wars
were an interesting sight.
Speaking of interesting sights, those who at-
tended OTR may remember Erica Frieburger,
bride-to-be, being whisked off into the jungle by a
band of animal-print loin-clothed natives. She was
eventually deposited next to Matt S. by the bonfire
where Matt addressed his worshipers with this
proclamation: "Fire is good.”

The happy couple (of whats?).
1996 Float Trip introduced “The Pearisburg
Three" as Mike Newsome and two fellow New Jer-
sey cayers were escorted to the Pearisburg Police
Station. Apparently the three were less than enthu-
siastic at officer requests that they remain clothed.
There goes the bride!
Old Timer's also brought the return of the
West Virginia Brewing Company van, thanks to a
select group of VPI cavers. (See DTC report in this
issue.) Doug, the WVBC manager, claims that he
can't get any of his employees to return to OTR,
