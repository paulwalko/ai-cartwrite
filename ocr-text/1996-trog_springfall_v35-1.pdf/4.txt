JUST ANOTHER SURVEY
by Carl Bern
I want to start this trip report by saying that
I enjoy surveying. Much of what is to follow might
indicate feelings to the contrary. Surveying is the
process of taking measurements which will be used
to create a map of the cave. Mapping a cave is a
challenge because you are representing a complex
three dimensional space on a two dimensional
page. Surveying is a challenge because you are try-
ing to achieve scientific accuracy in an environment
that is cold, wet, and muddy. The key to surveying
is mastery of the art of laughing in situations when
you would normally panic, cry, or push another
team member into a hole in the floor. Keep this in
mind as you read about a recent survey trip to New-
castle Murder Hole I took with Steve & Steve.
The morning of (date) was cold but not yet
below freezing when we finished chatting with Mr.
Seizer, the landowner for Newcastle Murder Hole.
We try to talk to him every time we visit the cave.
That is the best way to maintain good landowner
relations, and conversations with Mr. Seizer or his
son never fail to be interesting. We had to park at
the bottom of the hill near the gate. This was be-
cause a light rain was falling and that made the
steep hill more vulnerable to tire ruts. As a result
we absorbed plenty of rain between the time we
got out of my truck and when we were safely at the
bottom of the entrance pit. Morale improved as we
got out of the rain and made our way over the gap-
ing spaces known as the Straddle Pits. On the way
to the survey area we took the time to poke around
in areas that had already been surveyed. Steve and
Steve showed me a part of Murder Hole that is
close enough to the surface to have tree roots pen-
etrating down into the passage.
Having done a bit of sight seeing, we made
our way to the top of Seven Second Pit, the area we
were to survey. Now those of you who have rigged
ropes know that often the most appropriate anchor
is a BFR (Big F_cking Rock). Well, after much
searching for a suitable rig point we had to settle
for just a FR. It could have been worse, but it also
could have been much better. After tying off to it,
the FR did not give us any further trouble which is
strange considering how the rest of the trip went.
We picked up where the last shot of a previous sur-
vey
trip left off and continued down the some-
times narrow, always twisting pit. I remember one
point in particular about halfway down the drop
where all three of us were standing on a ledge bare-
ly large enough for two. Some time while we were
on this ledge Lepera had to work on his Maglite.
While he was working on that he dropped one of
the pieces and we spent many fun filled minutes
looking for it.
. . When we arrived at the bottom of Seven Sec-
ond we found a tight lead at floor level with a trick-
le of water draining from it. I inspected it and
noted that it open up some on the other side of a
pinch. The bottom of the lead was gravel and hav-
ing brought a trowel with me I decided I wanted to
dig it open more. After checking out the sumps in
the next room and seeing where the survey was go-
ing to take them next, Steve and Steve agreed to let
me dig. Being experienced cave surveyors they
both managed to hide the amusement which must
have been trying to creep on their faces.
Shovel in hand I wriggled into the crack, the
left side of my body sopping up the water mixed in
with the gravel. After a minute I wriggled out and
had to remove my helmet which had been imped-
ing my progress. Back in the lead again I began
scraping gravel out of the tight spot and towards
my face. Laying there with wet gravel pressed
against my cheek and a small puddle oozing into
my clothing I understood why so few digs are un-
dertaken in caves. Before long, I decided that I no
longer cared what was on the other side of this
lead. I kept digging, however, and saved myself
some misery in the short run by never laying the
right side of my body down in the water. After clear-
ing enough gravel to slide my shoulders a couple
feet further into the crack I was able to see into the
room I was trying to access. It was not much bigger
than me. I consoled myself by thinking that at least
no one else would be obligated to check that lead.
I caught up with Steve and Steve who had
made considerable progress on the survey while I
had been playing in the slime. They listened with
obvious delight as I described my efforts on the dig.
The passage we were surveying quickly dead-end-
ed except for one of those climbs that are so rare in
other caves but common in Murder Hole. The near
vertical slope was covered with sharp projections
and yet lacking a good line of hand and footholds.
It was coated with that drippy mud that contains
equal parts of clay and water. With a bit of effort,
Wells made his way up to a ledge-type area just less
than twenty feet up. Then he continued up another
climb about ten feet further up. Wells then got out
his seat webbing to belay Lepera and I up the
climb. We could see that a standard thirty foot sling
was not going to be long enough. Wells lowered
one end of his seat webbing to the bottom for us to
tie a second piece onto. He later told us that he was
