MODIFICATIONS TO THE GIBBS ASCENDER
by Lester V. Good
take an obstinate set to it. If the Gibbs is part of a
sewn climbing system, this type of attachment forc-
es the pin to be inserted on one side which may
cause it to rub a shin or other vulnerable body part.
Remove the cord and cable by drilling out
the rivets as necessary. By attaching a piece of 1/8”
cord from the cam to the pin and then to the shell,
it is possible to get the cam 4" to 5” away from the
shell. (See Figure 1.) This makes it far easier to
open the Gibbs for scraping out mud and debris. If
the Gibbs is part of a climbing system rather than a
safety, the pin should be reattached so that it is ori-
ented away from the body. Be certain that all of the
cord attachments are on one side of the Gibbs with
no crossover which could entangle the rope. This
has the added benefit of making it easy to see which
side the pin should be inserted.
When the Gibbs ascender was introduced, it
was a major advance in climbing technology. Over
the years, a number of improvements including a
quick release pin and a spring attachment made the
Gibbs more versatile and easier to operate. Even-
tually the Gibbs became an outstanding ascending
device. Unfortunately, the manufacturer contin-
ued to make changes to the Gibbs until it was cum-
bersome to attach and limited in its scope. With a
few modifications the Gibbs can be restored to a
superior climbing attachment.
SPRING LOADED GIBBS
The new spring loaded Gibbs requires that
the quick release pin be inserted through the
spring. This has several drawbacks: the spring can
become packed with mud; the spring bends mak-
ing it difficult to insert a pin; the user loses the op-
tion of disengaging the spring; and an oversized
pin is required. Rather than even purchase this
type of spring loaded Gibbs, it is better to buy a reg-
ular Gibbs to modify.
With a few tools, a spring loaded Gibbs can
be created. (See Figure 1.) First, drill and tap a
hole in the side of the cam and attach a 3/16"
spring. Next drill and tap a hole in the shell 3/8"
from the bottom edge, insert a 1/8" machine thread
screw with a 3/8" head. The screw should be flush
with the inside of the shell and filed until smooth.
There should be no sharp edges which can come in
contact with the rope. The screw head should be 3/
16" away from the shell to allow the split ring to fit
behind it. This arrangement allows the user to ap-
ply the spring only when necessary and remove it
when the additional drag is undesirable.

FINER TOUCHES
Even on a newly improved Gibbs, aligning
the pin with the shell and cam can be frustrating in
poor light or when hanging in an awkward posi-
tion. A substantial improvement can be made by
using a standard counter sink tool to counter sink
the cam pin hole by approximately 1/8”. This will
act as a guide for the quick release pin and makes
pin placement much easier.
There are many acceptable ways to attach a
bungie to a cam for a rope walker climbing system.
To minimize the amount of bottom tension needed
to self-start, attach the bungie cord to the cam as
shown in Figure 2. Drill a hole in the top of the
cam, tap the hole and screw in an eye bolt. Attach
the bungie with a small quick link.

Gibbs to webbing for a rope walker system, see
"Notes on a Really Fast SRT System..." by Paul
Kirchman (in a previous Trog which the editor
failed to locate).

ASSEMBLY
Even on the simplest Gibbs, it is difficult to
remove the pin and get the cam out of the way for
attachment to the rope or field cleaning. In addi-
tion, the cable can become twisted over time and
