KARST PROPERTIES, INC.
by Sarah Husband
I could barely wait through the two hour car
drive from the airport to see my new place. I always
have less patience when I'm driving...especially
with those ridiculous American speed limits I can
barely translate to kilometers. I drove feverishly to
my Realtor as I remembered first seeing the ad in
the paper for my lovely new place:
"Secluded English-Style home
Nestled
in cozy remote valley. Excellent
Deal!
Call Karst Properties, Inc."
Exactly what I needed. Complete isolation
from the rest of the world so I could finish my dis-
sertation on the acclimation of cats to exotic foods
in ancient Egypt. Karst...what a strange word...it
must be some American idiom, and I sure hope it
means peaceful! Now arriving at the Realtor, I pry
myself stiffly out of my trusty little Volvo station
wagon....only to find that MY REALTOR HAS RUN
OFF TO CALIFORNIA!!?
So this is it? Anyone could have taken my
key! What an awful Realtor....
After I'd done a sufficient amount of unpack-
ing, it was time for dinner. Hmm....Ma & Ed's diner
sounds indigestible... Country Cookin'; wow,
sounds like authentic American-style food! They re-
ally gave me the royal treatment at Country
Cookin’: interesting meat called chitlins, 'greens',
and cornbread...all very tasty! The waitress Jo-leen
was very kind and explained the name of the diner
across the way:
"Why is it not Ma and Pa's diner, as one
would expect?”
"Well, used to be, till Ma took up with one
uh thuh young cooks Ed, now it's Ma n' Ed's.”
"Hmm...how interesting.” She seemed well
informed about the town, so I tried another ques-
tion.
"Do you happen to know Jo-leen, why I have
no grass or plants of any sort on my lawn?”
"Well it's...well I certainly wouldn't know
Mr. Berkshire!"
Hm...no luck there..But I plan on buying
some grass seed at the plant shop soon.
"Hello Hector..did you miss me?” Hector
eyed me reproachfully.
“Aw..you'll become accustomed to the place
in a few days... I promise”
And he did. I had been reluctant to let him
outdoors though, especially with that hole in the
front yard which I've been meaning to fill with dirt.
Well, I'll just cover it with a board for now.
“Now you can go outside all you want Hec-
tor. I've boarded up the awful little hole and I'm off
to the plant store right now to get some dirt to fill
it!"
The plant store proved to be moist and
moldy smelling...as all plant stores are. I buy some
grass seed and two ten-pound bags of topsoil. I also
select various bulbs for the garden.
“I bought you some kitty food Hector. They
didn't have your favorite kind at the grocery mart,
but I think you'll find this pate interesting!”
What a quaint little grocery mart they have.
Velvet paintings of Elvis, whole ham hocks on dis-
play, and pictures of hunting men and their game
on the wall next to the prize deer head.
Here's your key -
Sorry I had to
split... Great jol
offer in Calif!

I climbed back into the car, and let my beau-
tiful orange cat Hector comfort me.
"Oh Well Hector, it's time we take a look at
our new place!"
The house looked just like it did in the pic-
ture, L shaped, two magnificent brick stories...but
not a blade of grass on the whole front lawn...how
odd! I'll definitely have to plant a classic English
garden. Hector followed me about as I unload the
car. It's a nice place...hardwood floors, brass fix-
tures, and a real porcelain sink and bath
tub...strange that it went for so little...must be
some local ghost stories scaring customers off-but
luckily I don't believe in ghosts.
