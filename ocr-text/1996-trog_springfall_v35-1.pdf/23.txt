As if the beer wasn't enough, this OTR
brought about the first "Bobbing for Booze”. Many
VPI folks braved a bucket of icy water to get their
teeth around a bottle of rum or tequila. Blindfolds
were provided, though seeing didn't make the task
much easier. Rumors abound that this may become
an annual event. Nothing is certain, however, be-
cause none of the participants can remember that
night very clearly

Can you identify this club member?
It wouldn't be OTR if Ranger Dave (Cinsay-
ich) didn't execute another 10.0 face plant into the
ground. This time he even scratched up his nose
and ruined the lenses in his glasses. The nose was
rather fat the next day, so he kept it well hidden in
a WVBC mug.
This year marked the first Elvis Grotto Ping
Pong tournament. Despite rumors of an Olympic
medalist who fell shy of the gold medal due to his
broken leg, the tournament wound down to our
own Ko Takimazawa and some guy from another
grotto. Ko played bravely and well, but was ulti-

the 100 mark with ease.
One big draw was the speaker, Phil Lucas,
who demonstrated fancy new toys for setting bolts.
His presentation was lively, amusing, and best of
all, brief. Another boon was the superb catering
done by VIPs own Steve “Tink" Williams. The Rec
Center allowed cavers to spend the night on class-
room floors, thus permitting cavers to party to the
fullest and remain (relatively) safe. Unfortunately
for one trainee, Ray Sira rendered the trainee's
sleeping bag useless when he decided not to retain
the large meal he'd eaten earlier. (Perhaps the next

Ah, yes, awards. This was the year of the gua-
no clusters, as many people were thanked for their
contributions to the NSS Convention and other ef-
forts. Though recipients were urged to "cooler
dance” onstage, Glen Davis was the first to figure
out what coolers are really for: they contain beer.
Once that secret came o
