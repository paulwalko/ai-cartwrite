"It's poison! It'd kill the whole town if I let it
grow. Do you know that? The whole town would
just die! Bad luck grass...saved the whole town I
did!”
The fire Marshall decided that the old man
should go to a mental hospital...for his bad effects
on the "environment”...which relieved me to no
end. The VPI cavers offered to study the cave to de-
termine whether my house was in any danger of
falling into a sinkhole, in return for the only other
key to the gate over the cave. I wasn't particularly
concerned about my house falling down into the
ground...it had been there for 87 years, and I
hoped it would be there for another 87.
We walked toward a the light of his
house...through crumbly, grassless dirt again.
There I found my beautiful Hector meowing
plaintively beside a rusty wheelbarrow... dressed in
some newspapers taped together and with tinfoil
covering his ears. Poor Hector! I immediately took
it all off, and gently held him in my arms. He looked
like he had a hurt paw.
"Poor baby! You know Hector, we're going
to cover that hole for good...a big metal gate...and
we'll build a fence too...a big iron fence that no-
body could climb over."
THANKS!
The VPI Cave Club would like to thank Glen Davis and Jackie Hoell for
their tremendous contribution to the club over the years.
Glen donated his time and his bright orange van to run the Club Store
for over ten years. He attended more Friday night meetings with van in tow
(not literally!) than we can count.
Jackie handled the massive paperwork of the club files, which over
time took over a big chunk of her home. The files lived with her for over ten
years.
