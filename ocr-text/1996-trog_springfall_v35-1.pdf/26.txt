OTR '95
by James Whisenhunt
The only place to have OTR is in a karst re-
gion so many people went caving on Friday. Myself,
I didn't want to use that much energy on a cave
trip; anyway my state of mind was not up for a cave
trip. I found some of the people I caved with before
I joined VPI and we went to Blackwater Falls which
is the largest above ground falls in West Virginia.
On the way back we rode a ski lift. The top had a
very good view but it was tricky getting off and hit-
ting those little white dots. The operators of the ski
lift probably thought we were drunk.
OTR
Daily, West Virginia is just a small town that
most people would think of as having a population
of about 100 people. No matter how small this
town is, on Labor day weekend it draws more peo-
ple than any other town for its size. Every Labor day
2000-2500 cayers forget the real world and venture
into the land of OTR to forget their troubles for the
weekend; believe me OTR is the place to forget
anything. For those who do not know what OTR
stands for it is Old Timer's Reunion and for those
who have been there nothing more needs to be
said. It will be impossible for me to do OTR any jus-
tice in describing the activities that occur during
that weekend. Mainly because of the temporary
amnesia that strikes 90% of the people, and to most
the disease is caught within the first few hours. I
was one of those who got struck early so my mem-
ory is not as good as it should be. It is OTR's fault I
cannot remember.
I was number 781 to enter the campground
only after the gates have been open for nine hours.
That's not even half of the total number to arrive in
Daily during the weekend. If I am not mistaken the
total number for this OTR was about 2100 people;
that's a lot of cavers having a good time.
After arriving there the first thing I did was
sit my tent up. Then it was time to have fun and
venture to the main crowd in Venders Row. Here is
where I met Claton [sic] for the first time who had
already developed an extremely bad case of amne-
sia. I told him my name more times than I tell any-
one in a week.
Venders Row is a paradise for cavers. If you
ever need anything that is cave related, vender row
is the place to get it. There was a wide variety of
venders: B&C Wunderwear, Bob and Bob, and
even a stand to offer psychiatric help. After things
settled down on Venders Row we settled down at
the club tent. Here is where Philip taught many of
us the expression, "When I was a trainee....” Philip's
shock treatment was another unforgettable experi-
ence. Since most of us were not thinking clearly we
were talked into standing in a circle with our fin-
gertips to the temples of the persons standing on
each side of us; meanwhile Philip started the tor-
ture machine. It really didn't hurt, at least I don't
think it did, but there were lights flashing in front
of my eyes. The scary part was that we kept coming
back for more. Clation (real sic] was the worst, ei-
ther he had no feelings in his hands or he was for-
getting that it hurt from the amnesia. Claton [sic
again) would sit there and yell, “I want more juice!
Is that all you have to offer? More juice!”
There was a get-together at the pavilion on
Friday night where many round tin aluminum cans
of liquid refreshments were tapped. Everyone
there seemed to be felling really good. There was a
huge fire that everyone gathered around talking
and having a great time.
On Saturday Carl, Steve, Barry and myself
decided to rappel down Seneca Rock to try out our
new gear that we got the day before. Seneca Rock
was nice but it would have been better if Carl and I
hadn't gotten separated from the others. We took a
wrong turn as we were walking up the path. We fi-
nally gave up and went back to OTR to try our gear
in the vertical contests. I tried my system first and
climbed 100 meters in one minute forty seconds,
and Carl climbed the rope in one minute twenty
seconds. There were many other activities there be-
side the vertical contests. There was an obstacle
course that was fun to watch, especially the chil-
dren. It was a great course; it simulated a cave very
good, it just needed to be dark. There was crawling
in knee deep mud, climbing, crawling through a
stream, and a crawl through a small pipe to the fin-
ish line.
