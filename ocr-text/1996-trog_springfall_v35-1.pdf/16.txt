"Hector!" I yelled into the hole "Daddy's
coming to get you! And I've got your favorite sweat-
er and some pâte, mmmm mmm!”
They ended up tying a rope to the banister at
the top of my staircase, and then proceeded to tie
a bunch of this rope stuff around my waist, clipping
some metal contraptions onto me. This would be
my practice rappel. Two of them who were already
ready helped me, while the others busily carried
rope and tied various knots.
"Whoa...ha ha!" I laughed as I rappelled
down to the first floor. It took my mind off of Hec-
tor momentarily...unfortunately not long enough. I
rappelled 3 or 4 times, and got to be quite good at
it. I could go fast, slow, or stop completely. They
told me to go as slow as I could in this cave. I nod-
ded.
tiny feet and their balance. Since he's not right
around the pit he must have survived the fall...or
lived long enough to crawl elsewhere," one of the
girls conjectured.
I hoped it was the first explanation. I
brought out my pâte and opened the package.
"Hector....Daddy's here! I've come with your
dinner!" I called into the darkness. I heard no sign
of Hector. When we all finished rappelling we
started toward one of the exits of the room...it
seemed likely enough that Hector would go that
way. We all looked for paw prints in the mud. I was
glad I they gave me an electric light, because these
people with carbide seemed to continually cajole,
praise, or curse their lights to get them to work.
"Paw prints!” someone yelled after we'd
searched for a while.
"Oh Hector!
They followed a small path by a stream to
narrow for us to walk, so we had to walk through
the stream. This was quite unpleasant. My feet got
so wet and cold! After a while we saw a bluish
light.there was the strange smell of rotting plants.
This was quite strange...we came upon an old
man...surrounded by a table and some bluish
lights...he looked quite startled when we arrived.
"Didn't I tell you youngin's not to come near

my cave?”

Finally everyone was ready to go. People
started to disappear into the hole. Then it came to
be my turn. They told me to yell “falling" if I was go-
ing so fast I could stop myself. They checked and
rechecked my equipment and watched me put the
rope through the rack. They made sure I had “as-
cenders", a "ropewalker", and "knots", lots of
equipment! They also put an ascender on my "seat"
and showed me how to clip it on the rope just in
case I got in trouble. I felt quite secure with all of
these safety measures they were taking for me. I
looked quite silly actually...my big gardening boots,
overalls and some wool shirts...quite like a lumber-
jack I'm sure!
I have to admit the seat was not particularly
comfortable, and occasionally I pushed my feet
against the sides of the close walls to relieve some
of the pressure. The walls of this hole bellied out
and then would get narrow again. Some parts I had
to scoot on my bottom, because it was more hori-
zontal. I made sure not to sit on the rope, as they
had told me not to.
"What a lot of worki" I shouted at the end of
my rappel. There was a pile of rope at the end
the end
which I attempted to avoid.
They told me to do what I could to keep
warm, because it was a little chilly in there. I ended
up doing some of my moves from my Richard Sim-
mons video...they all looked at me strangely...but
they looked even stranger, wearing garbage bags!
I never needed a garbage bag...the aerobics
did me well. They'll just have to learn.
"Could my Hector have survived that long
drop?” I asked nervously
"Well, he might have taken a fall or two, but
not for a great distance. Some of those places a cat
could walk down that we couldn't, because of their
"We've come for my cat, have you seen him?”
"Shore...he's at my house this very moment.
Found the poor thing wandrin' around all wet and
cold."
"What is it that you're doing here?” I asked
"Experiments! I'm a famous scientist!” he
yelled accusingly, as if we should have known.
He had various hangers covered in tinfoil
and just a bunch of junk made into pretend ma-
chines he also had piles of decomposing leaves and
grass (my grass?)...he seemed crazy...like a schizo-
phrenic you see on the street.
"Leave me alone...hafta finish these
projects...these projects need to get done..no one
else is going to do em for me ya know!”
“Certainly sir. But could you show us where
to find the cat?"
“Cat, what cat! Git, ya hear! Git!”
He proceeded to shoo us out this hole which
led to a yard.
"But sir...why do..where are you getting this
grass..why?"
