into the bedroom slippers of his very mad wife. We
put him in the dog house for days. He promised at
this year's OTR to not get in trouble the first Friday

(Denouement: When Dave Cinsavich
and the reporter arrived at OTR '96, Friday after-
noon, word quickly reached them that Doug Shel-
ton was telling everyone who asked that he came
back to OTR with his excellent beer only because
VPI had made the June trip to Morgantown. It was
good to see Doug again and even better to taste the
wonderful beers his business makes. We had sent
him and his staff a thank you note in July, with a
photo and a message, “We'll be back.” Doug told us
at OTR that several wait staff quit after seeing the
note. (We think he was joking.) Apparently many of
them were concerned about us that night. The bar-
tender asked Doug if she could cut us off. Doug
told her we were walking to a hotel and to keep the
beer coming.
He even had a story of his own about that
night. Turns out he was already in the dog house
with his wife and mother of his son and daughter,
because of a late night party he attended the night
before. He had promised to be home early to make
up for it, but our company proved too much temp-
tation, and he was still at the WVBC when we left.
Having forgotten his front door key, and unwilling
to ring the bell and wake his wife to let him in, he
walked around back and was trying to quietly sneak
in the back sliding door. Quietly is to drunks what
honestly is to politicians. Suddenly, the glass door
that partially supported Doug as he tried to slip in
