Wonderful brew. (Some of you may remember
Doug as the tall, blond-haired man with glasses and
a crooked smile, that runs the booth at OTR. He en-
joys late night hot-tubbing and thinks that we are a
bunch of raging alcoholics which he means as a
compliment.] Well-acquainted with the staples
through our exposure at OTR, many of us stuck
with the seasonals for the most part and aban-
doned 3 oz. glasses in favor of pitchers.

THE ARRIVAL
We arrived in Morgantown around 4:30 p.m.
Doug as mission specialist had secured reserva-
tions in advance at the Hotel Morgan, selected for
its two-block location from the WVBC. After check-
ing in, we docked the Naggon, leaving Sweetie Pig
on board to guard the ship. We expected to take on
two additional crew members, Ed Loud and Mark
Slusarski, once we reached the pub.
As we entered the WVBC, two wait staff
greeted us. The reporter inquired, “Is there anyone
waiting for a group to show up?” The wait staff
looked confused.
“There is one guy at the bar drinking coffee,"
one of them offered.
"Not them,” we replied.
They furrowed their brows. “What about the
two guys out back pounding beers?" the other of-
fered. That seemed highly likely, and in fact, Loud
and Slusarski had started without us. We arranged
a few tables on the deck and met Woody, our ex-
tremely cute server.
THE BEER
A key mission objective was, of course, beer.
We ordered the sampler, a bargain at $2.25 for sey-
en 3 oz. glasses, one for each fresh-made beer.
WVBC currently maintains four staples on tap: the
Cheat Mountain Gold, the Appalachian Ale, the
Blackwater Stout, and the Grist Mill Wheat. Three
seasonals, a Kolsch, and a Rye Brown Ale in the fil-
tered and unfiltered varieties, rounded out the of-
ferings. Woody presented each sampler
individually, describing each beer and lining them
up over their logos which were printed on a lami-
nated place-mat that had been set before each of
us. Obviously, this place has much pride in their
product, and one taste justifies it.
People with a wide and knowledgeable pal-
ette for beer would have enjoyed any of the seven
offerings. Everyone had a favorite though. Alice
particularly enjoyed the Grist Mill Wheat (served
with a fresh lemon slice for those who fruit their
beer). In this reporter's opinion, the unfiltered Rye
Brown Ale surpassed the filtered in every way. Ed
and Mark had already killed one pitcher of the
Kolsch, a clear, golden brew with a clean taste.
They (with others) went back for more and more)
of that. Our host, Doug Shelton, the Manager, even
brought us a pitcher of the Pale Ale that was to re-
place the unfiltered Rye Brown Ale when it ran out.

THE FUNDAMENTAL OBJECTIVE
Veterans of the past three Old Timer's Re-
unions may also be acquainted with the fine prod-
uct made and sold by the WVBC. Earlier in the
spring, rumors began to circulate that the WVBC
would not be attending the 1996 OTR. Deeply con-
cerned (and slightly demented) the sub-group in-
tended to convince the WVBC to come back. Let's
face it; many of us have gotten spoiled by not hav-
ing to haul ridiculous numbers of cases of beer to
Dailey.
Doug the Manager expressed his concern
about the $700 he lost in 1995 (down from a $1200
loss in 1994). Fees and permits to sell his product
at OTR total around $700 alone. In addition, he
can't just haul his own kegs from Morgantown to
Dailey; he has to sell his beer to his distributor in
Dailey and then buy it all back at the distributor's
markup for the weekend. We asked him to tell us
what he thought he would need to charge to break
even. (The WVBC enjoy themselves so much at
OTR that profit is not their goal, although they con-
cede it wouldn't be a bad thing.) He thought that
$10 for a two day mug, or $5 a day would do it. We
assured him we thought that was a more than fair
price.
