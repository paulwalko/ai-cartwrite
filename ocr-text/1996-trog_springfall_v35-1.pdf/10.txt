the deck for a refill before we continued to the
basement where they keep the huge 600 gallon
storage tanks and kegged beers.
Rather than kegging, hauling upstairs, and
tapping at the bar, the WVBC's bar taps pull from
storage tanks via neatly bundled clear rubber tub-
ing that snakes along one wall and up into the base-
ment ceiling. This reporter guesses that a keg rarely
blows at the place (and is probably something to
see — a goal for the next trip).

THE FOOD (Yes, Food)
OTR and pitchers of beer secured, the crew
advanced to the next goal of the evening. While
many in the VPI grotto espouse the notion that,
"food is death,” in fact, this is not always so. With
plans to close the WVBC that evening, nourishment
seemed like a good idea. In addition to its incredi-
ble brewery, the WVBC also has a top notch kitch-
en. The meal began with several loaves of Beer
Bread, made from the left over grains used in the
beer brewing process, and served with a honey-
butter. Menu items included Cajun Alligator Tail,
Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo, Trout Almandine,
Pasta Al Fresco, an Ale Marinated Flank Steak that
melted in one's mouth, Ratatouille Lasagna, a vari-
ety of sandwiches and salads, and beer battered
"Brew Fries.” Truly delicious.
THE BREWERY TOUR

Some beer gets kegged for distribution
throughout West Virginia and into Ohio and Penn-
sylvania. (Doug said they are aiming for Pitts-
burgh.) As the tour concluded we agreed: Doug
knows a lot about beer, and made an excellent tour
guide.
Chilled from the beer coolers, we left the
basement. Outside we viewed the new WVBC Ford
van, complete with full color logos of their staple
brews (a highlight attraction at OTR).

For dessert we decided to take the brewery
tour, with Doug as our guide. “Fill your beers, and
let's go,” he told us. We began inside at the mash
kettles and boilers where the technical end of
things was explained. From there we went back to
Happy among the kegs. The bundle of tubes overhead connect
the storage tanks to the taps upstairs.
