After the brewery tour there was but one re-
maining objective —- inebriation. We drank beer,
beer, and more beer. No one knows exactly how
many pitchers we drank. Rough estimates suggest
that at least one-third of the pitchers we drank ney-
er made it onto our tab. Our tab also had several
pints on it that we believe to be discount pitchers
as no one was silly enough to order only one pint
at a time.
Doug the Manager gave up being the sober
type (he had a hangover from the night before),
and began to pound pitchers with us. He's a fun
guy with a dry sense of humor, and before the
evening was over he had Dave C. and the reporter
half talked into going to the Feline Club, a strip
joint he knew of. Eileen got the late night
munchies, so Doug the Manager escorted into the
closed kitchen where she selected a dessert. (A
yummy moist banana cake with cream cheese frost-
ing that the reporter begged a bite of.) Before leav-
ing we bought several half-gallon "growler" jugs for
friends in Blacksburg, mostly unfiltered Rye Brown
Ale, of course. (The crew agreed in hindsight that
we bought too few, and there were several critical
moments on the trip home where we nearly desert-
ed our generous intentions and drank the beer
ourselves. Bribes are being accepted now for those
wishing to have growlers brought to them after the
upcoming June '97 trip.)
After midnight, one by one, the crew began
to slip out and up the street to the hotel which, for-
tunately, had huge red neon letters spelling out
most of the name on the the roof. (By night it is the
Hotel Mo gan.) The reporter, Dave C., Dave S., and
Thimble Bladder O'Malley in a contemplative stupor.

Eileen stayed longest, leaving around 12:40 a.m.
(The bar closes at 1:00 a.m.)
THE NEXT DAY
We felt amazingly good on Sunday. As one of
the Davis's put it, “I feel like I've gotten away with
something." Before we checked out of the hotel,
which had coffee and doughnuts in the lobby, Glen
attempted to figure out everyone's portion of the
total WVBC bill which he had settled for the group
the night before with a credit card. The numbers
didn't come out right, so feeling hungry, we went
for breakfast.
Ed Loud, who met us for a cholesterol buffet
at the Ponderosa, said the good feeling wouldn't
last through breakfast. He didn't lie, although the
general consensus remains that we all should have
felt much much worse. Once again, Glen attempt-
ed to portion the tab, and this time he had better
success. (A calculator has been put on the equip-
ment list for next year's trip.) Overall, our tee-shirt
and food total for the group ($180) outweighed
our beer total ($145). Had we been charged for all
of the pitchers we actually drank, our alcohol bill
would have far exceeded food and clothes. We
made a brief stop at Ed's to meet Rhubarb, his po-
lite and pretty calico cat. He bribed us to stay for a
beer (a tough sell with this crowd), but after one
round, we hit the road.
Ed had started something though. Strategic
reserves running dangerously low, we sought beer
at every potty stop. West Virginia has weird laws.
Some counties locked the beer coolers outright.
Others opened only at 1:00 p.m. We scored at a
Kroger where we bought lunch junk, and we ate
and partied all the way home.
