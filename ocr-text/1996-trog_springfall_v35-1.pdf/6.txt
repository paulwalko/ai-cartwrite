the house. Just as I was about to pursue that option
I practically crashed into my truck. Wonderful. My
fingers were so numb with cold that I had to oper-
ate the car key with my palms. Then, as I was about
to strip off my muddy suit and hop in the truck I re-
alized that I had a problem. I had a frozen seat har-
ness on outside my suit. After about two seconds of
mental debate climbed into the truck, frozen mud
and all. I got the engine going and flipped on the
headlights so the Steves could find me and then
waited to warm up.
The heat in the truck did not seem to be
working very well, and I had just warmed up
enough to start getting out of my frozen gear when
the other two showed up. Before long, we were
changed and packed up and the trip was safely over
with, or so we thought. As we started the drive
home Lepera complained that the heater seemed
to be blowing nothing but cold air. Then, as the
truck forged along at 35 m.p.h. in temperatures in
the teens, the engine overheated and stalled. Un-
fortunately this happened while a county sheriff
happened to be behind us. I managed to get the
truck off the road and he pulled up alongside of us.
I don't know what he thought of us. From his point
of view we were three muddy faced young men all
wearing black leather jackets in a truck with New
York tags that had stalled in the middle of nowhere
in Craig County. I had a twenty minute conversa-
tion with him that he conducted from inside his
cruiser while I stood outside in the elements. At the
end of it we had a tow truck coming for us and he
drove off. With the sheriff gone and the engine cool
we dumped our remaining drinking water from the
trip into my leaky radiator. Heat was restored to the
cab of the truck and we judged the problem tempo-
rarily solved. With our fingers crossed we proceed-
ed straight to the closest source of beer and
companionship, the Bat Ranch.
