THOUGHS ON CAVING
by Judi Wolinski
Caving for the first time, I ran back to record
the moment in my journal. Yet now when I go
thumbing through the entries I discover how I have
matured and grown as a caver. Deeper discoveries
still lie unknown within the passages of my own
caverns.

Links The expansion of grey blended into
one at the edges of the sky. We made our way up
and over being suddenly sucked almost vacuumed
into small brown, grey intestines of rocks. I
breathed in spiny, drippy, dewy formations. I
breathed out blankets of black fog that engulfed
cavers one by one as each light went out. My heart
pumped fake blood- weak in strength. I chimney
into a 5-9 room (Good Luck), there was no where
left to go. The body contorts in many different
ways. Shifting, shapping into the mud I slide along
on my stomach crawling in an S formation. Going
deeper and deeper into the darkness there is no es-
cape. Our bodies were trapped in a world of make
believe no color- no sight - just our voices carried
on invisible air molecules that bump and part and
squish to make way for our foreign bodies in this
unfamiliar space. My light failed me once as I exit-
ed from the forked tongue of the snaky Å  There is
no going back I wanted to see, but there was no
sight. Mud caked and weary from the travel the
world pops back at you like a pop up book. Ive
woken up been born again into a crystal world full
of earthly things.

Newberry Baines We are all creating our
time lines of extinctions that have a miniscual effect
on the time line of the world. But when I drop un-
der the ground that time line has disappeared. I
exist for an infinite amount of time. There is no
fear in me just the awe inspiring experience of life.
I learn to trust myself and the cavers around me.
Yet I become tired as I reach my infinity and we
close in on the extinction of our cave existance. I
don't necessarily feel invincible, I dont feel as
though I am conquoring the world- nothing like
that. I discover my quiet introverted side. The side
that doesnt need to force thoughts or opinions.
That lets the cave run free with in me. I can block
out the earthly world - the world that doesnt quiet
exist as I do in this cave right here and now. The
human mind is the only thing that limits our possi-
bilities because we double check ourselves- scare
ourselves and question the one life that we live.
The cave opens up her virgin passages to explore
new possibities new paths in life. We all explore in
the darkness sometimes, Why not feel comfortable
within it?
After caving many more times I have become
more awa
ne question of why pursue this ad-
venture. Is there always someting to be found or
gained. The tangible reasons that exist slip away be
tween my fingers like mud. I look within myself
and fellow cavers to discover my own love of cav-
