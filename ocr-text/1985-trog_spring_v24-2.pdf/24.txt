Spring Break
This past spring break saw a large contingent from VPI
down in Alabama. The group consisted of Jerry Redder, Doug
Perkins, Walt Pirie, Craig Roberts, Maureen Handler, Lee
Little, Hank Heidt, Bob & Jean Simonds, and Bob Alderson,
We were joined by Chuck and Pat Shorten and Hillary Minich.
After driving for 8 hours and guzzling more than a couple
of beers, we arrived at the camping area, Now, when Jerry told
us we would be camping in a dump, we just assumed that the
place was kind of trashed. But we were wrong!! We camped
in a DUMP, trash, dead cows and all.
Saturday morning rolled around early and we got all geared
up to bounce Stephens Gap. The pit is a 130' free drop with
2 waterfalls and a walk out second entrance. Everyone had a
great time except for Pat and I, who had to go into Scottsboro
for a new radiator hose for the van. That afternoon found us
at Neversink, At 160' deep, it is probably the most
picturesque pit in all of Alabama., Unfortunately, some vandals
have painted a large skull and crossbones on the cliff next to
the pit. Next time we may want to carry some acid and/or
wire brushes up to the pit for a little de-Grafitting. That
night while enjoying a little well deserved relaxing back at
camp, some cavers from Huntsville Grotto showed up and gave us
the locations to a couple of new pits, which we decided to try
out. Our first pit Sunday was Pretty Well, a. 1931 drop with
beautiful formations all the way down. Then we drove to Hall's
pit, but the trip was cut short due to lots of loose debris at
the top and no where to get out of the rockfall zone. Sunday
night provided more partying and good times to be had by all.
Monday we all went to Valhalla, (minus Chuck, Pat and
Hillary who had to work). The weather couldn't have been better
and the pit was awesome. A 220' free drop of mind blowing
proportions. Lee and Hank decided to hike cross country to the
pit and never showed up due to a lack of a good sense of direction.
Half of us took off for home after Valhalla while the rest
went to Monsanto state park and bounced Natural Well Tuesday
before heading home. The trip was great with no major incidents.
I'm certainly looking forward to next year's trip.
