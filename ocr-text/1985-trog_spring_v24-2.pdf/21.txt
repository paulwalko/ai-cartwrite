hydrology would be the identification of cave stream branches corresponding to the
traced sinking streams in Clover Hollow, and subsequent analysis of waters from these
tributaries of likely contrasting transmission routes.
The Rise of Sinking Creek For about half the year the entire surface course of
Sinking Creek down to the junction with the New River contains flowing water. At the
lower flow stages the total flow of the creek is swallowed by several sink points,
the first visible one at a distance of 5 km from the New River. No passable openings
are visible along the creek in the vicinity of the sinkpoints.
Despite being one of the largest springs in Virginia, the rise of Sinking Creek
on the New River has a noticeably unimpressive appearance. Water discharges from a
30 m stretch of rubble forming part of a railroad embankment at the foot of a cliff.
Besides the trace of Sinking Creek to the rise on the New River, only one other.
sink point was traced to that rise. The stream sinking into Williams Cave 1500 m
northwest of Tawney's Cave was traced in low flow stage to the rise of Sinking Creek
only. Two traces in high flow stage, however, were detected both at the Sinking Creek
rise and at Bell Spring, another from-under-the-railroad-rubble spring on the New
River 1500 m to the north. The area from Williams cave and the sinks of Sinking Creek
to the New River is one of high doline density with very little flowing water, pre-
cluding an easy trace to define the low flow divide between Bell Spring and the rise
of Sinking Creek.
Bell Spring Drainage Doe Run was traced to Bell Spring from an upstream sink point,
one of several along the stream course. A considerable portion of the doline field
east and south of Doe Run probably drains to Bell Spring as well, as do areas within
a mile of Sinking Creek during high flow stages, as the traces from Williams Cave
demonstrated.
