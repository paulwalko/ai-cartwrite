YOU'RE GOING TO GET SCREWED AGAIN!!
By the time this is published, the State of Virginia, with
not a little Federal prodding, will have set up the mechanisms
to raise the legal drinking age to 21 by the Fall of 1986.
Now I know that this is not going to stop you guzzlers from
buying or 'obtaining' whatever you need to drink (it never
stopped us back before they lowered the age limit), but we would
like to point out a fascinating alternative --- brewing your
own beer.
Now I know that you have probably tasted the results of
some local home-brews and have found the quality lacking.
Don't be discouraged! .Some reasonably good beers can be made.
IF YOU DON'T HURRY!! I have no intention of presenting a
detailed "How to do it" article here, but there are several
good publications on this subject, Buy one if you're interested.
I would recommend "Home Brewed Beers & Stouts" by CJJ Berry.
You will find instructions here for making beer from kits and
malt extracts as well as beginning from the basic malt..
EATS Natural Food Co-op in Blacksburg is a good place to start
shopping. They have books and brewing supplies at reasonable
prices. I will only emphasize two things that are of extreme
importance in brewing. Keep your equipment sterile and don't
be in a hurry to sample the results. Just follow the instructions
and be patient. If a slower brewing method is offered as an
option, use it! The pleasure will come when you sample the
results knowing you have screwed some tax money from the people
who screwed you out of your rights.
Note: The DTC does not advocate violating the law-but we won't
stop you.
DIC Tips
When preparing for a big party, Bill Koerschner would pre-mix
his drinks in resealable bottles, making the first drinks
strongest, the last weak. Then he could flame out early but
sober up by the time to leave.
When driving tired or... (well we don't do that, do we), Don
Anderson suggests holding an empty bottle over your head. If
you start to doze off, the bottle will fall, hit your head and
wake you up.
