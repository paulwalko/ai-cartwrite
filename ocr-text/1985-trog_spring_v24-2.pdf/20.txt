from Link Spring. This small cave probably originated as a meander cutoff, and may
still function as such during very high creek levels. To the south and out on the
bend is Link's Cave, with about 300 m of passage and major trend along the strike.
Link's Cave most likely is an abandoned subterranean meander cutoff route.
Clover Hollow Drainage
Most mountainside drainage in Clover Hollow sinks soon
after encountering the limestone; only during very heavy runoff does surface drainage
flow directly into Sinking Creek. Dye placed in Clover Hollow Cave and two sinking
streams on the north side of Clover Hollow in separate traces was recovered in both
Smokehole Spring and Tawney Spring on Sinking Creek, indicating a flow split. A
careful examination of the main stream in Smokehole Cave behind the spring revealed
a location where the cave stream split, with a major proportion entering a humanly
impassable crevice while the remainder continued on out to Smokehole Spring. Subsequent
in-cave dye drops from both just upstream and just downstream of the stream fork in
Smokehole Cave, with traps at Smokehole Spring and the upstream reaches in Tawney's
Cave behind Tawney Spring, indicated that all flow entering the crevice at the stream
fork in Smokehole Cave resurged only at Tawney's Cave and Tawney Spring, whereas flow
not entering the crevice resurged at Smokehole Spring. Together, these traces indi-
cated that a single flow split existed.
Surveys of Tawney's Cave and Smokehole Cave indicate that the two caves are
closely situated and represent major conduits for past and present drainage from
Clover Hollow. It is clear that during the evolution of Smokehole Cave flow shifted
direction from a westerly strike parallel trend to a southerly trend across the strike
to the present Smokehole entrances, leaving large passage abandoned on the west side
of the cave.
A dye trace from a sinking stream 1500 m north of the Smokehole-Tawney spring
complex indicates that drainage from the far side of the dolomitic core is being
transmitted across the strike and through the core rather than along the strike to
a more distant spring. The next logical step in a study of the Clover Hollow karst
