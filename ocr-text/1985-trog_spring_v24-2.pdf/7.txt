... A CHEAP, SIMPLE ROPE PAD THAT STAYS IN PLACE
How often have you carefully padded a drop only to find later
that your rope has found its own abrasive route somewhere other
than on the ropepad? Isn't that pad also likely to be a heavy,
cumbersome section of somebody's old carpet, your cavepack or your
spare shirt? The following description presents a cheap, simple rope
pad that stays in place, is easy to secure around the rope AND is
easy to rappel and climb past.
The primary component is a cut-off pants leg (from your last
pair of cutoffs or that pair of caving jeans you finally retired).
If this is not availible, a tube of material can be sewn, but that
gets too involved. The next component is some short sections of flat,
house: wiring (I used no. 14), cut to lengths which just fill the
width of the cloth tube. Strong cord for attaching the pad to
something is also required. A needle and thread (or a sewing
:::. machine) are the only other required items.
Insert the wire pieces into the tube of cloth as shown in the
figure, and sew in place. I used three pieces for a pants leg, and
sewed across the leg on either side of the wire, holding it securely
in place. Finally, punch a hole through the tube just below the
uppermost section of wire, tie your attachment cord on and voila, a
great rope pad is born!

Another idea that might be worth trying is turning the pants leg
inside out, coating both sides with canvas grip, positioning the wire
pieces, then returning it to inside-in. Pile books on top of it
until dry, or use a steam iron to set the canvas grip. I haven't

(thus less weight to drag back out of the cave).
In use, the wire inserts can be form-fitted to either a U-shape :

get above or below. This system is a lot easier than velcro straps, ;..
