Bandanna Mania
18
Many, many years ago, when Marco Polo brought to Venice
tales of Cathay and wonders of the Orient, explorers of many
nationalities ventured forth, across the seven seas, to find
fortune, adventure and sight to 'ooh' and 'aah! at. We are
especially indebted to the anonymous Portuguese traders who
"discovered' India, for they were responsible for the importation
to Europe' of that most marvelous and useful creation, the
bandanna,
When, early in the fourteenth century, these Portuguese
traders first landed, they were intrigued by the customs and
colorful clothing of the Indian peoples. Of particular interest
were the small squares of colored cloth the Indians called
'bandhnu' (to tie-dye). Their extraordinary usefullness was
not lost on the traders. They saw bandannas used for diapers,
scarves, handkerchiefs and secret homosexual codes, Bandanas
went to Europe on the first boat out, and gained instant
popularity.
Over the centuries, bandannas (or bandanas; you can spell
it either way) have been associated closely with various
cultural groups. First, pirates wrapped them tightly around
the necks of unpopular comrades, purportedly because they
misspelled the term 'tie-die'. Cowboys of the American West
used them to keep dust out of their beards so sheep wouldn't
mind kissing and housewives have recently found them useful
for covering up home permanents.
The decline of the genuine Indian bandanna has been
traced to the publication of the secret of tie-dying in the
mid-1960's. It is said that India made up for the loss of
revenue by exporting Hari Krishnas and Rajneeshis.
Now, the time has come for cavers to take up the bandanna.
banner. Wear a bandanna around you neck when caving. It is
stylish (Springsteen can't be wrong), protects your neck from
cold, and keeps the bandanna relatively clean (if your neck.
doesn't sweat too much) for things you need a clean bandanna -
for. The number of bandanna uses in caving is only equaled by
the uses of the 30-foot sling. With a bandanna, you have a..,
snot rag, eyeglass cleaner, bandage, tourniquet, helmet sizer,
blindfold, chicken loop, pack strap, dog collar, dust mask,
flag, trail marker material, camera rag and toilet paper. Some
of these uses are admittedly for emergencies only, so use good
sense, remember the history of that piece of cloth, and cave
softly.
