Federal Cave Protection Art
The Federal Cave Law Project needs the assistance of as
many cavers and grottos across the country as possible.
Needed are campaign chairpersons for grottos and other
National Speleological Society internal organizations. The
jobs for volunteers consist simply of interesting grottos in
supporting the Cave Protection Act, and organizing one or
two letter writing sessions.
We also need more volunteers to present our cause to
non-caving organizations, to perhaps meet with legislators,
and to coordinate activities at the state level.
George Huppert, chair of the NSS Conservation and
Management Section, has volunteered to be our campaign chairman.
Dave Allured is campaign coordinator.
What follows are excerpts from the new. NSS brocure
entitled, "This unique and fragile resource needs your help..."
"America's caves are being destroyed. Vandalism,
pollution, unregulated use and increasing pressures threaten
thousands of our finest cave resources. The proposed Federal
Cave Resources Protection Act offers an inexpensive and
effective solution to providing better protection and
management of these resources."
"Why is the Federal Cave Resources Protection Act Needed?
Extremely fragile and totally nonrenewable, thousands of
wild caves, along with the unusual life forms found in these
totally dark environments; the scientifically valuable geological
paleontological and cultural deposits, are being destroyed at
an alarming rate."
"The destruction of caves also means the loss of one of
America's mose unique wilderness resources...one where man is
truly in touch with his environment, unable to depend upon
modern technology, limited only by his own personal skills and
endurance in seeking out and discovering lightless corridors
where the sun never shines; where the rain never falls."
"Due to a number of grey areas in current laws and reg-
ulations, cave management is hindered by inconsistent and
arbitrary interpretation and applications of those statutes
and rules. Although extremely fragile and nonrenewable,
thousands of wild caves located on the public domain cannot be
properly protected--even though a number of agencies are' trying.
How will the Federal Cave Resources Protection Act help?
It will give caves and their contents a legal definition,
removing the grey areas surrounding their status; require that
caves be considered in land use planning; place a major portion
of the burden for management on users by emphasizing the use
of volunteer contracts and cooperative management programs;
allow Federal Land Managers to withhold sensitive.
caves location information; increase protection for cultural
and paleontological resources; protect taxpayers from expensive
liability suits and subsequent settlements against the
government arising from recreational use of public wildlands;
