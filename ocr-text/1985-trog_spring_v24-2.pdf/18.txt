anticlinal valley. Meadow Creek rises at two large springs near the gap through the
sandstone rim. Local base level in the eastern end of the anticlinal.valley, as well
as the elevation of the springs, is determined by the elevation at which Meadow Creek
spills over the lowest point of the rim. Meadow Creek has no doubt grown immensely
from a small mountainside stream on the outer rim wall of the anticlinal valley
to a major karst-headed stream by the continuing process of headward drainage capture
to the west. Fractures in the valley head associated with the anticlinal plunge
provided the weaknesses needed by the early mountainside predecessor of Meadow Creek
to breach the sandstone rim and initiate piracy of the headwaters of the Gulf of
Mexico bound Sinking Creek. Because of the steeper drainage gradient through the
Meadow Creek Gap than westward along Sinking Creek to the New River, the Eastern
Continental Divide (between the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico) has been
moving westward.
Fluorescein dye tracing has established that there are two branches of Meadow
Creek, with drainage being roughly divided by the central dolomitic core in the
anticlinal valley. The northern branch is predominantly a surface stream fed by
several small springs. After a surface route of four kilometers it sinks in all flow
stages into a large closed depression known as the Sinks of Meadow Creek. The north
branch of Meadow Creek resurges at Dudding Spring 2 km from the Sinks. A portion of
subterranean Meadow Creek can be seen at Cove Cave. 500 m west of Dudding Spring.
Cove Cave ends downstream in collapse, whereas upstream sumps. Most of the 60 m length
of Cove Cave appears to be developed along or near the Saltville Fault. At high flow
stages water discharges from the cave entrance. Thus the north branch of Meadow Creek
has both a perennial and an intermittent rise.
The south branch of Meadow Creek rises from an impounded spring at the fish
hatchery. In contrast to the north side of the anticlinal valley, drainage to the
fish hatchery spring on the south side is entirely underground, excepting the sinking...
streams along 9 km of mountainside. Like the resurgences on the north side of the
valley, the fish Hatchery spring is developed in the limestone. It is the only major ..
limestone spring in the study area that does not have a major associate distributary
