parallel talwegs on limestone. Westward from Clover Hollow both the valley and the
limestone exposures on either side of the dolomitic core widen.
Surface drainage in the two valleys consists of small mountainside streams and
the two master streams Sinking Creek and Meadow Creek. Most if not all mountainside
streams heading near the rims of the valleys sink upon encountering the limestone.
Flow from some of these sinking streams resurfaces at springs along Sinking Creek or
Meadow Creek, with flow from the remainder resurging at either of the two rises of
Meadow Creek or along the New River. Both Sinking' Creek and Meadow Creek sink com-
pletely for much of the year.
Methodology Sodium fluorescein in quantities of a to 8 kg was applied to sinking
streams in thÃ« period 1974-1978. Fresh activated charcoal granules contained in 5 cm
square staple-bound envelopes of nylon screening was used to adsorb the fluorescein.:
Elution was accomplished with 10% KOH in 95% ethanol, with an ultraviolet lamp used
to aid in visualization if necessary. With few exceptions, the charcoal traps were
collected only once from each location for each test. Duplicate traps were usually
: :placed in different spots at each spring to minimize risk of theft or chance contami -
nation.
Results of Water Tracing and Descriptions of Major Groundwater Basins
Thirteen fluorescein dye tests were made from eleven locations in the two valleys
to a total of ten springs from the New River in the west to the Meadow Creek Gap in
the east. The sink-to-spring straight lines shown on the map indicate that multiple
outlets for groundwater are not unusual in the structural settings encountered there.
Four of the six major groundwater systems studied discharge from more than one outlet. .
