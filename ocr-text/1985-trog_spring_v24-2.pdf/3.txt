President's Column
Greetings fellow cavers!
Although the end of the year is quickly closing in on
us, I'd like to interject my feelings concerning future
quarters.
How about some more involvement? Let's show some morale!
Serve on a committee. It's rare to have too much help. Have
an idea for a new committee or a money making scheme? Let's
hear it. The worst thing that could happen is that people
will laugh and throw things at you. Even if no one else
wants to hear your opinion, I do.
All of this is secondary to caving, of course. If you
are taking a trip and have room, by all means, announce it.
There are trainees begging for the Belly Flop.
One last reminder-try not to stagnate on the same old
trip to the same old cave. Explore! Find a new hole and
get in it!!
Cave tough,
Craig Ferguson
ONE THING IS CERTAIN WE'RE
UNDERGROUND
