Atonement At 100 Fathoms
Descent into the yawning chasm
darker, green and cool
another wo≈ôld, a feeling
of time eternal.
Deeper, out of the sun's daily influence
just a hint of surface air left
man's own light
enters the concealing gloom
and reveals to human eyes
those which have none
all around, squeaking, flapping.
A new feeling of peace there
as I hang to a thin lifeline, dangling
an intruder in the clammy eeriness.
Down, down, into the lightless depths
seemingly alone, yet in the home of
the unseen and unknown creatures of darkness.
Mind races, groping with imagination
of what lies below and beyond
a thrilling anticipation of discovery of,. what?
A tuned ear perceives the slow, steady
dripping of single droplets
echoing from a hidden pool, far below
just as they did yesterday, an eternity ago.
A strange peace here. Hanging on to life
as a spider at the end of it's silken thread
peering into perfect darkness
unseen, unknown, alone
in the massive inner space
I become one with the living earth.
