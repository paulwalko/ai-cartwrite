Once again it's time to get down and dirty. Now you
can read all about it. All the dirt that's fit to print and
even some that isn't. Is your name mentioned? Did you do
some thing worth talking about? Yes it's time once more for
the infamous, funny and you'll never live it down, the....
Grotto Grapevine
Events and happenings have been going on left and right
since the last TROG. First of major proportions was Banquet
with a record setting turnout of 140 people celebrating our
20th Banquet. Bob and Jean Simonds definitely deserve a 21
water pistol salute for their efforts in organizing the event,
Awards were presented after dinner to all who were deserving
and they all got what they deserved. Instead of Guano
Clusters, (*note, Ed Day arrived wearing the first Guano Cluster
ever awarded) recognition plaques were awarded to Ed Fortney
for his unending tolerance of trainees, Ed Devine for his
continuing work in Paul Penley's Cave, Buddy Penley for being
our A#1 land owner and to Hillary Minich for her skydusky
hollow survey and topo map. Craig Ferguson received flame-
out, AI Cartwright went to Glen Davis and our most obnoxious
member and trainee awards went to Frank Gibson and Paul
Soboleski irrespectively. Trainee of the Year was Rob Hills and
Joey Fagen was elected Armchair caver. On the home front,
Chicken wing discovered sex and was awarded for it, Psycho had
been seen with a number of different girls and therefore rated
a chastity belt. Phillip is somewhat PW'd by Jean and Mike &
Ignatz were the cutest couple there. Due to very safe caving
this year, there were no candidates for the Brain Bucket. Jerry
welcomed Trex and Stymie to the old Farts Club. Linda Oxenrider
was recognized for always being there and Lee Little was
commended for taking thousands of trainees caving. Fatito was
burned for having to be hauled out of the same pit two weekends
in a row, Carolzo was the least changed mama and Dave
Cinsavich was the perpetual trainee. The banquet was topped off
by a slide show by Chip Clark on his recent 'expeditions' to
Mammoth Cave. Banquet was followed by a great party at Turner
Beach.
After banquet, the weather started turning fair and our
minds were drawn to bigger and better things, such as picnic
and float trip. Picnic was once again held Mother's Day weekend
out in Buddy's field below Newbeery's entrance along with the
usual sixpack. With Psycho in charge, we know we didn't have
anything to worry about, or did we? Picnic was great with such
show ups as the Koeshners & Whitehursts from Texas and the
McQueary's, Bill Stringfellow provided plenty of firework
and explosive displays and there were rumors of nudity and a
citation with velour seats. Diddly did a pole trip to Coon and
Chip showed up with his new wife.' Danny Wright broke his arm
in a drunken act.
