: In the central Appalachian mountains of the eastern United States, two of the
major structural settings in which karst has developed are the long mountains and
the anticlinal valleys. Both settings are characterized by topographic orientations
along the trends of regional folding and faulting. Anticlinal valleys where narrow
are typically floored with limestone or dolomite, whereas underlying clastic units
commonly have been exposed in the wider anticlinal. valleys, leaving the carbonates
in strips on either side of the valley. Most of the anticlinal valleys maintain a
relatively uniform width, and several terminate in distinct valley heads where the
carbonates or underlying clastics on the floor plunge beneath the sandstones which
typically form the rims of the valleys. Where faults are found on the valley floor,
they are usually associated with cross-sectional asymmetry of the valley:
The two anticlinal valleys studied here contain two major surface streams.
Meadow Creek leaves the eastern valley head through a gap after rising at two large
springs nearby. Westward flowing Sinking Creek heads at a spring complex 10 km from
the end of the eastern valley, which has been made somewhat asymmetric by the Saltville
Fault that enters the western end of the valley near Newport and runs the entire length
of the valley. North of Newport, Sinking Creek crosses the fault complex and flows
northward into a second valley. Clover Hollow at the eastern end of this second valley
has a simple anticlinal structure. Westward to the New River the valley is wider with
more complex structure.
â€¢ Stratigraphically, both valleys are rimmed with Silurian sandstones. Cambro-Ordo-
vician dolomites form the central floor of Clover Hollow and the eastern valley, with
Ordovician limestones on the floor and lower slopes on either side of the dolomitic.
core. The dolomite is more resistant to weathering and tends to form a central ridge
down the middle of Clover Hollow and the eastern valley, bordered on both sides by.
