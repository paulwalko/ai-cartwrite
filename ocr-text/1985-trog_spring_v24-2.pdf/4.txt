I would like to thank everyone who helped in giving me
a TROG to print, I would especially like to thank Joe Saunders
who allowed me to reprint his sinking creek article which was
presented at the 1981 International Congress of Speleology and
which may appear in a future copy of the NSS Bulletin.
Due to the amount of work required to publish the Trog, I
find that this will be my last issue. Anyone who is interested
in taking over talk to Craig. I hope you all enjoy this
issue. Keep up the safe caving.
***Note to Blue Ridge and Tidewater Grottos, stop worrying
about whether you are wimps or not, go caving and find out!!

It may not be a good idea to go
walking around in bat caves. But
it's not a good idea to go around
your whole liſe being afraid of bats.
Bats and people are not enemies.
Bats will probably never become as
close to us as dogs and cats. We will
have our world. And they have
theirs. But we are both a part of the
same world. A
