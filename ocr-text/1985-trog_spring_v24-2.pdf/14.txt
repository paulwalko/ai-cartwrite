Kaluha
Here's a recipe you may want to try...
3 cups water
3 cups sugar (brown preferably)
3 Tbl Spn vanilla
3 Tbl Spn coffee, instant
3 cups Vodka, 80 proof
Boil everything except for the vodka and let it cool.
now youve got a couple of hours so go call a friend. If it
is long distance you have money and need not make your own
Kaluha. When cool, add the Vodka. Bottle in brown bottles
and hide for 4 weeks. Makes about 4 16oz. bottles. Resealable
Grolsch beer bottles work well
