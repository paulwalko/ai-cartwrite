The last and most recent event was Float Trip. The
river was flowing and we were ready. Over 100 persons and
rafts of all sizes and shapes appeared early (?) Saturday
morning. Lee did a great job as admiral. Fatito showed up
attached to a keg and a number of people lost their clothes
for the duration of the trip, Except for Win's dog getting
carried away by the current, there were no reported incidents.
There was, however, a rescue call by Buddy at 2am and just
when the rescuers got their gear together and sobered up, the
cavers showed up and the rescue was cancelled.
Other dirt worth talking about is Capn Ed has been taking
kids caving for pay. WVACS weekends are going strong the 3rd
weekend of each month and the club donated $100 to help them
purchase their new fieldhouse. Monroe County weekends are on
the 2nd weekend of the month with the likes of Jack Kehoe and
Garrie Rouse showing up. Garrie has also mapped over a mile
of passage in Stompbottoms cave. Surveying is continuing as
ever in Newberrys. On the lighter side, Sue and Rick La.Course
are going to Ireland this summer and are looking for cavers to
rent their town house, which by the way as had cavers in it
longer than anyother dwelling in the town of Blacksburg.
Laureen is practicing for heart throb for next year, Rob
"Belushi' was picked up for Drunk in Public and had to spend
the night in Christiansburg as punishment. We had a practice
rescue and Fatito was 'rescued' from fawneys smoothly with the
radio operators 'hamming it up'. There was also a recent raid
on a large bridge in a nearby state, the names are with held
to protect the guilty.
On the club business side of things, we have had plenty
of new members come up. Congrats to Craig Roberts, Paul Hess,
Dave Bennet, Paul SobƒÅleski, Jean Simonds, Joan Johnson,
Dave Cinsavich, Hank Heidt and Rob Hills and if I forgot anyone,
