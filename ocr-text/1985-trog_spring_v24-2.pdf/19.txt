outlet, although there are two small flood outlets located within 30 m. It is likely
that the difference in mass wasting which has kept drainage on the south side of the
Meadow Creek valley well underground whereas the surface of the north side of the
valley is lower with predominantly surface drainage is due to the much higher dip. and
the Saltville Fault on the north side..
Head of Sinking Creek Sinking Creek upstream from Newport is fed by numerous small
to moderate sized springs in dolomite and limestone. The creek there is draining
land with a low doline density. 1500 m west of the topographic divide with Meadow
Creek, Sinking Creek rises at Early Spring on the south side of the valley. In higher
flow stages an intermittent spring 100 m away becomes the surface head of Sinking Creek.
A fluorescein trace in high flow from a mountainside sinking stream just west of the
surface drainage divide tested positive in Early Spring and the intermittent spring,
as well as at Slovensky Spring 300 m to the northwest. Considering that a sinking
stream just east of the topographic divide had been traced to the fish hatchery.spring,
it would appear that the Eastern Continental Divide, known locally as "the Allegheny",
coincides approximately with the groundwater divide.

There is a conspicuous travertine deposit 2 m high, 10'm wide and 6 m long associated
with a small spring along Sinking Creek where the Saltville Fault complex crosses
the creek.
Subterranean Meander Cutoffs at Link's Bend Dye dropped in Sinking Creek upstream
of Link's Bend was detected in charcoal traps in Link Spring on the west (downstream)
side of the bend the following day, and was thought to be visible in the spring at ..
dusk forty minutes after the drop. No intake point is visible along the creek bank
at the bend, so the waters that reappear at Link Spring after cutting under the neck ..
of the meander must sink into the floor of the creek. There is a 30 m crawlway cave.
just above creek level on the upstream side of Link's Bend almost directly upstrike...
