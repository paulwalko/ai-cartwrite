You can helpi (1) Please write your federal representatives
and ssk them to help sponsor the introduction and support the
passage of the Federal Caye Resources Protection Act (2)

organizations to write letters encouraging your state's
federal delegation to support the act.
We presently anticipate the simultaneous introduction of
the Federal Cave Resources Protection Act in both the House
and Senate during either Februrary or March 1995. If you
have the inclination, additional letters to the committee on
Interior and Insular Affairs, U.S. House of Representatives,
Room 1234, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, D.C.,
20515 and to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,
Room 3106 Dirksen Building, Washington D.C. 20510, will be
especially helpful.

Your help is absolutely essential to the success of this
legislation's introduction and passage. All we are asking for
are a few moments of your time to write and mail a couple of
letters supporting a resource protection bill that finally
makes sense.
