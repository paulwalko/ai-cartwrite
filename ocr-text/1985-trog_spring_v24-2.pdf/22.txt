How To Screw Your Boots
Soles blowing out on your boots is a common occurance
among cavers. Besides being a pain, it is a safety hazard.
A little preventative action can add weeks to the life of
your boots.
Screw in 568" flathead screws between the lugs or tread
about iz" in from the edge (any closer to the edge or on top of
the lugs will cause them to kick out quickly). Do this when
the edges of your boots are first starting to peel. It
probably won't hold a sole that is completely off.
If you aren't to lazy there are other things you can do
to make your boots last longer.
-Don't let mud dry on your boots. Wash them off.
- Don't dry wet leather by a fire or heater. Stuff boots
with newspaper and let air dry.
-Wax them occasionally. Melt Snowsealer or Beeswax on
a stove or hotpot and smear on generously. .
-You can save the toes of your boots by canvasgripping
them with patches of denim. Do this before you wear a hole
in them (this doesn't last long in really wet conditions).
