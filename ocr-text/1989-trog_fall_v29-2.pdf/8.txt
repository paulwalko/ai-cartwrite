NOTICE:
(from VARFYI)
On the "limited Access/Closed Cave" list is NEW RIVER CAVE. Tim Kilby bought the land
(NSS 27387). He wants people to cave there, BUT expects them to be experienced and well
equipped. He also wants you to CALL or WRITE BEFORE you go: 703-273-4870 any day
between 8:30 am and 10 pm. The trail on the north side is on someone else's land-- so keep
off without his permission.
