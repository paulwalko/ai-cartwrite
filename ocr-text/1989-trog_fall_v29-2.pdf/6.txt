Rescue Gear 89/90
Hey y'all. Let's get philosophical first. Is it me, or is Michael Jackson prettier than his
sister, Janet? Ponder that one.
Now, let's get serious. In the fall of '88, in partial response to the Pighole body recovery,
the rescue gear was inventoried and updated. This had not been done since Lawrence Britt had
the job in the early '80s. Many thanks to Jackie Hoell, Carol Zo., Jean Simonds (I love this
job; it's all women), Ko, and the several P.M.s who helped out
Overall, the gear was in fairly good shape. We did find some areas for improvement, i.e.:
1) The parachute harness is now used for parties only.
2) There's a shit load more sling for the stokes.
3) Several more wool blankets.
4) Addition of sam splints.
5) Super cool neck braces.
6) 1 body bag.
7) Prepositioned bash bags at Jim's house in Newport and at Buddy Penley's house.
8) Relocation of the gear from Glen Davis' house to Cecile James' house (sign out).
Let me explain our reasoning for the last two points. In recent years several cavers have
moved out of the metropolis of B'Burg and into the surrounding wilderness. Most of our
rescues will be headed in these directions. This way there will be medical gear available to
people on the way, so that they don't need to come into town for the major part of the gear.
These initial teams can locate and start initial treatment of the patient in a shorter amount of time
while the rescue gear is in transit. The bag at Jim's house covers the Links, Tawneys, New
River, Smoke hole, and Clover Hollow Area. Buddy's bag is in his garage and covers
Skydusky Hollow. Jim's bag could be used for the odd W.VA rescue if needed.
As for moving the gear, this was done strictly for easier access. It's not neccessary to
break into Cecile's place to grab the gear. Also, we can update it much easier. Thanks to Glen
for keeping it, and to Cecile for taking it!
Technically speaking, not much has changed. The extra sling was mentioned by Carol as,
being very helpful in rigging the stokes, guidelines, belays etc. The wool blankets were
donated. There are 4 in the stokes, and 2 in the big medical box.
Now a few thoughts on procedure. If it is deemed necessary to get the rescue gear, the
best thing to do is take all of it. This includes the stokes with duffel bag, Ked, Sked, and
Oregon splint. For convenience, these are all kept together. During a rescue, however, only
the stokes and the duffel bag go into the cave. The duffel contains the sling, blankets, biners
etc. for the stokes. They always stay together. The other things can go in if needed. The
medical gear, bash boxes and box #4 are kept in the large box marked "medical". Hi-line,
pulleys, racks, carbide and lamps, helmets, chocks, and that sort of stuff is in a box marked
"technical". This is almost always needed even if the medical gear isn't. Finally, there is wire
for the field phones (which are in the tech. box). A milk carton contains several thousand feet
of wire. There are 2 additional rolls. So basically in a rescue there are 4 things to remember to
take: stokes duffel, medical box, technical box, and rolls of wire. Ordinarily, it will take two
people to haul all this junk, plus a pickup or hatchback. Study the enclosed gear list to see
what we've got. It's good to know, so that you don't use one thing when something better is
available. I urge everyone to be familiar with the gear. Just let me know, and we'll take a look
at it.
In closing, let me discuss the rescue committee. I basically take care of the technical gear
while Jackie keeps an eye on the medical end. It's more or less a gear committee. We also
hold practice rescues. Anyone in the club who is an EMT or better should consider themselves
an unofficial member. The technical side (Hi-lines, hauling, etc.) can come through your
normal caver genesis. The Zo.'s are talking about having a technical practice rescue in the
spring; sounds like a good idea.
Well that's it. Cave safe, party hard, and hopefully we won't have to use this gear.
