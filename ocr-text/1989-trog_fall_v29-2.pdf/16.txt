The Exploration of la
Sumidera de Juanita
There I was, hanging pendulous above the cleft with only a gossamer thread of 7/16 nylon
rope to keep from plunging into the frightful abyss. Noxious vapors rose to envelope me,
no doubt the result of decomposing orgasmic matter. The source of the gasses could be
seen below. It was a gism slick, the opalescent sheen of the surface broken only by
occasional bubbles of methane issuing from the putrescent semen. I was hardly the first to
pass this way, the other intrepid explorers had lost their load at this very spot. I struggled to
control the spasms in my loins, and slowly the fear and lust subsided until I was able to
continue my descent into the void.
La Sumidera de Juanita had been discovered and first plumbed in 1967 by that pioneering
French speleologist Norbert "Plumbob" Castyourseed. Following directions given by a
small Mexican boy in a parking lot, he ventured toward what he supposed to be a rural
brothel. What surprise to discover Juanita, an actual virgin, sequestered in a nunnery. This
is the goal of all true explorers, untrodden ground. So it was that the first seed was planted
in Juanita. From that day til this, the slick has spread as teams from around the world have
come to find themselves poised above the brink and unable to control their lower hindbrain.
I was equipped. Kneehigh galoshes plopped into the glacier of goo. I was undeterred, for
long experience had taught me that sperm only lives for thirty-six hours. This was not
unlike an experience years earlier in which a mad steer was somehow placed into a huge
neoprene body bag, then pitched into the cave which is now known as Mad Steer Cave.
The cow's carcass festered quietly until that day when I came to step on that bag which was
lodged atop a short drop, followed by what remained of the cow. As I fell, broken bottles
and jagged metal lacerated my body. Think of the cow as a form of well-aged Hollandaise
sauce and my head as a poached egg.
.
A new odor alerted me to another pile of festering feculence. A twin chasm in a cleft to the
left issued forth a great conical heap of guano. This peculiar geological formation arose as
Juanita was giving birth to a grotto. The rupture perforated the perianal travertine
membrane. The adjacent tube was inhabitated with bats, thus the guano.
The birth was complicated by the fact that the young grotto suffered from hydrocephaly, the
head of the passage being filled with water. The air space was bad due to the passing wind
from the nearby perianal rent. I wanted to push on, but was stumped where the passage
sumped into the cortical void. I peered deeply into the pool of profound stupidity, but could
go no further.
