Newberry's -- The Ongoing Survey
After three kids and one MBA the Newberry-Banes survey is again underway. For those
who like to know, we have taken 53 different mapping trips for a total of 6.25 miles of mapped
passage. That breaks down to 2080 shots with an average of 15.9 feet each. Most of the well
known tourist areas are complete, leaving us with the usual large number of leads to check.
We also have the problem of working around the large bat population in the winter time.
After breaking down about six years worth of data and plotting a working copy of the map
by hand, we finally invested in a computer. Now the whole cave is on SMAPS, and we can
get a copy of any area we need.
We owe a special thanks to Mr. Buddy Penley for letting us go to Newberry's whenever
we can find the time. We have had many wonderful experiences below as well as above his
property. We especially enjoy the friendly visits in the warmth of his family room.
We also would like to express our appreciation to Mrs. Saddie Banes. Although we do not
use the Banes' entrance as often as the Newberry's one, Mrs. Banes lets us "cross the fence"
whenever we need to.
We have had the help of about 35 different cavers and several babysitters. To these folks
we would like to say "Thanks," but to also remind them there is still more to do. We still have
all the drops to work on, and who knows, maybe some more virgin passage for a lucky few.
