almost the distance to the moon, mostly on heavily potholed roads. The feeling passes, though,
when I realize that in many ways, so have I.
7:08 -Ileave most of the lining of my brake shoes on 181 trying to stop for a monumental jam north
of Roanoke. It seems that every college student in the eastern United States, very few of which can
actually drive, is passing through this stretch of 81. Since, collectively, they seem not to have figured
out the "left side - passing side, right side - suicide" heuristic, it is no wonder this happened. I take
the first exit I see, and smiling smugly, bypass the jam by taking Route 11.1 later found out that a
certain ex-vice president didn't have as manly brake shoes as he thought and after an
uncomfortable lesson in inertia on the same stretch of road, drove home with the hood of his car
held down by a chain of carabiners.
9:22 PM - I pull into Jim's driveway and look around. The garbage is blowing past the debris on the
porch as drunken residents of the Newport Alternative House weave around the lawn, laughing to
themselves. One can almost hear the cider perking away down in the basement. Ah, home.

My Hair Raising Experience as a Trainee
It was a beautiful September day as Jake, Maurya, and myself walked to the footbridge at
Tech for our first rappelling session. I was completely prepared to jump off the bridge,
entrusting my life to some rope, a few pieces of metal, and about ten people who had spent the
last weekend drunk and naked in West Virginia at OTR. We reached the bridge and, as I easily
stepped into a sewn seat, I chuckled at everyone else being tied up in endless feet of webbing.
Little did I know; soon I would be the source of humor to everyone else present. I was a bit
scared as I stepped over the side of the bridge and began to rappel. Of course I appreciated the
helpful advice from Jake & Dougo, "If you spread your legs wider, it will be easier... Yeah,
just a little wider." Awful nice of them to be so willing to help a naive trainee like myself. I
rappelled past the lip of the bridge and continued my descent when it happened. I found
myself going slower and slower, then I felt my head and my body being pulled in opposite
directions. It was then that I realized my hair had become entangled in the rappelling device. I
was lucky our vice-president was present to offer helpful suggesions like: "Just pull your hair
out of the figure eight." Yeah. Sure Brian, and how about a nice portion of my scalp along
with that? Finally, Tom Bank came to my rescue (sigh...). He rappelled next to me and
proceeded to attach us together at the pelvis, while I straddled him. It was a good thing Scott
Rapier was there, camera in hand to catch that special polaroid moment. Anyways, to make a
long story short (too late, I know.). I stepped all over Tom to release the pressure off of the
rope and free my hair. Tom and I were detached, and I finished my rappel. What should have
been a one to two minute descent turned out to be twenty minutes stuck in the middle of a rope
in a somewhat compromising position with a man I hardly knew. But hey, I suppose there are
worse ways to spend an afternoon.
