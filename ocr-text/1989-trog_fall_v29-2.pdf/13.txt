the cam and fewer missteps, none on a properly adjusted system.
The system can be finished off with the seat of your choice.
I personally like a compact seat which holds the attachment biner
low and tight to the body. The typical climbing sit harness does
not do this, but to each his own. For climbing we require three
points in contact with the rope. Since a pulley does not count,
we use a long seat point on the rope above the pulley. This can
be a gibbs which can ride unattended or a handle jammer for people
like me who use their arms a lot. The sling for this point should
be long enough to be used to aid in climbing but short enough to
reach while seated. A short seat point, gibbs or jammer, is handy
for passing obstructions. With the chest pulley disconnected and
the short point attached, the long point can be reattached above
the obstacle. You can then disconnect the short seat and proceed
to move your foot points one at a time past the obstruction all the
time keeping a minimum of two points on the rope while in
transition. This technique can be used to pass lips, knots,
rebelays, other climbers, and possibly gas. A neat trick Berta and
I discovered was that by sitting on the long point and reversing
the short point below it, slack could be pulled up so that a rack
may be threaded in peace without rope weight. A warning though,
you must be able to pull the rope up with one hand to release the
point. No wimps please.
Just a few more odd notes and I gain my freedom. If you
rappel a long drop, foot stirrups are a must. They hang from the
rack and support your feet in a sitting position. This keeps your
seat from cutting off all the blood flow to your legs and prevents
the pain and discomfort of gangrene and eventual amputation. A
simple solution if you rappel in your climbing gear, which is not
a bad idea on long drops or first descents, is a short piece of
sling or utility cord hung from your seat biner. Simply put this
through your foot cams and you have infinitely adjustable rappel
stirrups.
The system described above is a caving rig. It was developed
for doing long drops comfortably. Only after two years of constant
use in all types of vertical work did we consider the possibility
that an efficient comfortable rig would be competitive in timed
events. A few minor modifications alter the caving rig into a
racing rig. Racing is allowed with only two foot points and a
chest roller so no seat is required. With the seat missing, the
knee cam can be made longer without risk of fouling and a longer
step can be taken for running in T-shirts, we add soccer forearm
pads to the chest rig to make up for the lost padding of caving
clothes and Berta likes to use a shin pad to protect her leg from
the lower cam.
That's it, all of our secrets, short of diet, exercise, and
genetics. It works for us but may not work for you. Luckily
climbing rigs are not sold in the Sears catalog yet. oh sure we
all buy the same parts but how we put them together is up to us.
The rig described here was made in response to some very specific
