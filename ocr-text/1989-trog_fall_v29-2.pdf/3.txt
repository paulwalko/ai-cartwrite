The President's Column
Well, the fall semester is almost over, and it's time for me to write the President's column
again. VPI Grotto is alive and well. The attendance of meetings has been high, and there are
a lot of prospective members. Despite very wet fall weather, we had many trainee trips. The
bridge sessions were held every Friday even in the rain, wind and other obstacles. We also
had a practice rescue in Tawneys led by Capt. Ed. We have gained four new members to the
Grotto this fall. Congratulations guys! More trainees should be coming up for membership
very soon. I would like to thank those people who have taken trainee trips and helped at the
bridge sessions.
I hope that this coming winter will be good for the club as well. There are trips planned for
TAÄž area as well as Mexico and Costa Rica in the spring semester. It is great that VPI is
represented at many places, but we should also look at our home ground too. Now that the
weather is turning cold, everyone should be starting to think about ridge-walking and
surveying. It's been two years since we voted to support resurvey of Giles county or
GCCS. We are losing the initial enthusiasm that we had. There were few survey trips and
ridge-walkings this fall, but they were led by the same people, GCCS is a tremendous job,
and VPI Grotto as a whole, should support the program. Members -- take trainees on survey
trips. Prospective members -- ask members to take you on survey trips. You will learn so
much more about caves and caving.
Cave safe and party hard.

Vice President's Column
We have started this year with a good group of prospective members. There are many new
and old, and they all are participating (caving, partying, four-wheeling, etc.). Like always,
everybody has done their part to make the club continue the teachings of safety and
conservation. I need to thank Ko, Ed, Paul, Tom, and many others (you know who you are,
and there are too many to list) who have helped me greatly at the bridge, and taking training
cave trips. Due to this help we have four new members and probably more people coming
up for membership soon.

Remember: There is always more to learn, and more time for caving and partying.
