GROTTOE GRAPEVINE
Since we left our intrepid explorers at the end of the last grapevine, all sorts of stuff has come to
the press. Shortly after school ended brave members of the club gathered in Mr. Buddy Pendley's
field to celebrate the annual picnic. The bicyclists went on two seperate days, neither having much
luck with the fierce climate. Meanwhile back at the field the lucky ones went underground while
the rest of us were deciding if our immunity would hold up thru the weekend. Mother nature
(don't forget your mother) threw all she could at us. But drank we did. Beer combined with a
blazing fire, (complete with VW block) kept the happy campers warm. Gale force winds woke few
that nite due to the presence of Killians. The survivors were seen the next day gulping down the
last keg-lite beer, as snow squalls blew in down the valley. Later in the month Float Trip occured.
Heavy casualties in the armada and cold water forced consolidation of the forces. The summer
residents past the time tubing, barbecuing and drinking.
The semester for the Club started the week before OTR, which left some of us explaining to
newcomers that we couldn't take them on trips because we all were going to the largest caver party
on earth. Jerry Redder and Dave Cinsavich ran OTR this year. Some folks arrived a week early to
start setting up. The other 1700+ of us showed up later. Nazi of the year goes to Captain Ed for
his efforts as chief gate guard. Much amusement was had at OTR-do-dah parade (well enter and
win next year), flushing portajohns, bonfires, 4-wheeling madness, 35+ people on Brian's
Landcrusher, raging hormones. Dave Warren earned the nickname "Chummer" at the more wine
party down at the river. Jerry & Co. will do it all over next year. Altogether a weekend of good
clean fun. Most had a mild case of Anheuser's Disease (OTR Disease) which caused beer
consumption to be low the following week.
Once back in town the club resumed crazyness as usual. Parties were held (even 1 sauna),
and trainees went caving. Mike and Sallie started things off right by getting arrested for being
drunk in public the first weekend back. A little communitiy service never hurt anyone. Jean
Hartman decided on Turkey (not Columbia) as the place to teach english. Joan Johnson moved to
NoVa and is working for the Justice Department. Hugh Beard is teaching in Front Royal. Lee
Little might be in VÄ€, & Eric Anderson was sighted at the Dylan concert. Beth Wichterman is
back in the DC area and Hillary Minich has moved to New Mexico. John Loner got a real job in
Colorado. Lor Windle is leaving the marines. Barbara Grahm moved back to Lexington.
On the relationship/baby front- Ed and Linda Devine had a baby girl on October 6, Amanda
Muriel Devine. Pat and Chuck Shorten had a baby girl in June, Chilissa Marie Shorten, Randy
and Ruth Wood are expecting in January. Nancy and Alan Knewstep are expecting around March.
Keith Smith and Mary moved to Oregon. Kent Thompson and Michelle were married November
11. Jerry Redder and Joan Hederick were married over the summer and now live at Joan's down
by the hospital. (anybody wanna buy Jerry's old house??) Alice and Glen have announced their
engagemente Jenny Ford moved to Charlotte and married Will Allander, Mike and Vi moved to
Bath County. Becky Himmelmann finally married Jeff Harding.
Philip bought a new Justy over the summer, and leaves his wagon at home to keep his 7 cats
company. Mike Fiore is back from another summer of managing disturbed kids, finishing up
research and job hunting. Doug Bruce is not a student, and is surveying for money (above
ground). Dave Cinsavich, who rolled his new Blazer off Brush Mt. coming back from a party also
happens to be out of a job. Captain Ed is working for WUNDERWEAR (paid advertisement).
The homebrewers (Joe, Ko, Chris, Brian, Mike) are brewing up something of massive
proportions. Brian got a 4AM call on Monday to rescue stuck 4-wheelers (Scott, Joe, Lesley).
Kay Johnson went caving again (practice rescue victim, 2 years running). Joe finally came up for
membership
The Halloween party was at signout this year. A tyrolean over Pembroke Quarry warmed up a
few folks beforehand. Chris Stine (North Jersy Grotto transplant-hide your women and children)
organized the event. Much liquor was consumed, friends were made and hormones raged. Ben
won best costume for being "Mr. Butts". Most radical hair change went to Sara. Scariest went to
Sandy Peterson, though many women thought Pyro's gynecologist costume was the scariest.
Caving Briefs-Stompbottom might have a new entrance-surface digs at a blowing hole make
folks hopeful. Stompbottom is also being entered onto SMAPS. Ed Devine was seen carrying a
scaling pole out of Paul Pendley's. Stay High was extended after some brave folks did a stream
dig.
