Crusher and Tromper
Once upon a time, must've been round September few months back, two evil 4-wheel drive vehicles set to
working on a plot for the exploration of unpaved roads and murky mudpuddles. OTR thus marks the beginning of a
new era of cave club off road fanaticism for Brian and Scott. The two vehicles in question, a blue 1970 Toyota Land
Cruiser OUW-770 and a white 1986 Izusu Trooper II BLC-101, have been seen of late venturing out where others
have not dared in search of mud and adventure. Both good and bad adventure has been found, as evidenced by the fact
that both cars were put out of commission for a brief time. The local areas of off road madness include Butt
mountain and Brush mountain, with typical obstacles including fallen trees, water and mud puddles, and various
other avoidables. Another improbably 4-wheeler came into play one night when Philip decided to take the Justy
off-road. Unfortunately, the car wasn't quite as adventurous as Philip was, and ended up door deep in water. Pictures
were taken as the untrusty Justy was pulled forth from the red sea and returned to the land of dry ground. Of course,
this isn't to say that I've never gotten stuck, as Brian will contest to after a four a.m. call woke him up and persuaded
him to tow my car out of a chassis deep mud hole. The Crusher has yet to get stuck, although I'm waiting for a call
from Brian at four a.m. to tow him out next. Major problems have been had by both of us as far as car casualties
go. We've decided it definitely is not an inexpensive sport. Since this began, my car has had the clutch replaced, a
rear seal on the transmission replaced, and my carbuerator replaced...the Crusher has had the ignition system replaced
almost entirely. Next time, I'll get a car a little bit better built as far as structural strength and abuse goes. The
members of the four wheel madness crew include Koichiro 'walk-on-water' Takamizawa, Kristen 'get more' Posson,
Philip 'flocculant' Balister, Brian 'flip the blazer' Cruikshank, and the "Midnight Hikers" of Joe Uke, Lesley Colby,
and myself among other occasional riders. What does the future hold? I'm not sure, but improvements for the cars
seems to be in order, as well as new inductees into the midnight madness of off road adventure.

Links in a Nutshell
Yeah, well, Links Cave... what can we say?! I'm sure most of us have been into it at least once or twice, a
in my case, a dozen times. Links cave is a very fun, potentially challenging cave to poke around in, plus it
belongs to Jim. Just a short hop, skip, and a jump up the hill -- and beware of the latches.
One of the most entertaining trips that I managed to take in Links involved two of my high school friends,
Robert Carter and Paul Plantz. Also roped into this trip were Loretta Bush and Kristen "Get More" Posson.
This was to be the first trip by these two into a wild cave, and Links, my pet peeve, was the obvious choice.
So, off we went, to thoroughly initiate these two into the fine art of VPI caving..
Arrival at the farm involved getting dressed and prepared, something that Paul and Rob were excused from,
coming perfectly prepared as new cavers invariably do. After hearing such comments as "So, where's the cave?",
and "Wow, do we get helmets and neat lights too?", we headed up the hill.
Cave topics included "You gotta be kidding me -- that entrance is way too small!", and "Are we really going
to have to go through that?" Loretta, Kristen, and myself chuckled with the thought of the S-crawl to come.
Into the cave we go... "Slow down, Scout! You're crawling too fast!" Humph...just waiting til later. First stop
-- the 5.9 climb...first obstacle S-crawl "Okay guys, time to go into the hold!" This comment did not meet
with much approval, especially when they saw it. Despite the numerous oofs and-umphs, damns, shits, and
other curses, I was eventually joined by the pair on the other side. "Do we have to back through that?" heh heh
heh.
After a fun 5.9 excursion, the only thing left was the canyon section. Back through the 5.9 we went, leaving
some of the curses behind. Into the canyon we go, hi ho! Or so I thought..."You have GOT to be shitting me,
Scott!" and "How the Hell did you get up there?" Well, after much explaining as to how to accomplish this
maneuver, they decided against trying it. Back through the canyon we go, hi ho!
Sitting down in the precanyon, '15x8 inch phallicmite' room, we let the kiddies look around for awhile.
Listening to this pair was more than just a job, it was an adventure. "Hey Paul, look at that! It's a
Dragon!"...or alternately, "AHH!!! It bit me! Snaaaake! Needless to say, a spirited bunch. We could tell they
were returning as the tune I Feel the Earth Move Under my Feet reached our ears. Thank God that abated
quickly enough
"Finished?', we asked, Did you have fun?"
"Yeah, now lets get the fuck out of here."
"Well, okay, but I'm afraid I'm kinda lost at the moment. I've been trying to figure out where we are while
you were playing."
"AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
You KNOW I just couldn't resist...
Heh Heh Heh
