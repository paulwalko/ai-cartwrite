Reflections of the "Victim"
As a survivor of two club practice rescues in two years, I'd like to describe the rescue from
the point-of-view of the "victim".
Last year's rescue was in New River Cave. Joe Uknalis waited with me for the rescuers to
arrive. No offense Joe, but waiting in a cave gets really dull!
I'd been warned that I would be very cold, so I brought hat and gloves, and wore several
layers of clothing. Carol Zo, thoughtfully provided me with down booties. For my comfort,
since I was not a real patient, I wore goggles instead of the full face shield. I also chose the
option of not having my hands tied, but my arms were tied down under a wool blanket. My
legs were very uncomfortable from the first, although the sling holding them was loosened at
my urging while I was being tied in.
The trip out of the cave was uneventful for me except when Craig Roberts was standing
nearby. There were many experienced cavers directing the rescue. They seemed well
organized, and there were many hands for Stokes passing. The dryness of New River Cave
meant there was little slipping, and there were several stretches where the Stokes could be
carried instead of passed. The rescuers tried to remember the "One, two, three lift" scenario,
but they often forgot. They didn't forget to ask me how I was doing which I was grateful for.
My head wasn't always above my feet, but being healthy, it didn't bother me. I inhaled quite a
bit of dirt, but I have never minded inhaling dirt, and it was my own fault for picking the
goggles over the face shield. What bugged me were my legs; they were stiff and
uncomfortable. I longed to bend them. Happily, I was warm and almost cozy which made up
a bit for the discomfort of not being able to move. When I was finally released from my
prison, it was very hard to bend and walk.
This year the practice rescue was held at Tawney's Cave. Doug Bruce accompanied me in.
Waiting wasn't as tedious as it was last year because we entered the cave right before the
rescuers. Last year, Joe and I had arrived early at the cave, and entered before the rescuers
were ready to go in.
Tawney's is wet and muddy, and the creek was higher than usual during the practice
rescue. My feet were soaked before I was tied into the Stokes. We gathered in the sinkhole
where I put on my hat, gloves and extra sweater. Unfortunately, the sinkhole is the coldest
part of the cave. I was colder than last year, and all of us forgot to take my wet socks and
boots off. I opted for the goggles again despite strong protestations from the trip leaders. I
can be a stubborn bitch, so they decided to let me eat ceiling if I wanted.
The rescuers for the Tawney's practice rescue were younger, and there weren't as many
compared to the New River rescue. They were much more conscientious about keeping my
head up, but they also got my elbow stuck near the ceiling when I was passed through a tight
spot. My hands were poorly tied together which made me happy because I could release them.
Unfortunately, my arms weren't tied down under a blanket so they got cold and tended to flop.
My legs and back were stiff, but my legs were much more comfortable than last year. My back
was less comfortable because I could feel every knee and rock under me. I think there was
more blanket under me during the New River practice rescue. Neither rescue party was great
about doing "one, two, three" before lifting. Minor details. The Tawney's rescuers didn't
tend to ask me how I was doing. Ed sort of took my pulse. I think Natalie was the one who
thought I looked cold. I was impressed that someone noticed! Yes. I was cold. It seemed
like this year's rescuers were less organized than last year's rescuers, and I got impatient
listening to people deciding what to do next while I was cold and stiff. Part of the problem
was there were less people to get things done. Overall, the Tawney's rescue was probably
more useful than the New River rescue because it gave different people leadership roles, and
gave prospective members a bigger variety of rescue training. I also felt the Tawney's rescue
was more grueling on its members because of the nasty wet conditions of the cave. I know we
were all relieved when Philip finally got his feet wet.
That's it. Anyone who wants to apply for a job as practice dummy, contact Ed Fortney.
