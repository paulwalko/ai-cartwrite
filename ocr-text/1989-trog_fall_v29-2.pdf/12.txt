have taken us years to get around to sewing a vertical rig or
possibly writing an article about one. I've seen very nice rigs
that took a long time to put together. They also take a long time
to fix when worn. The tendency to push this gear further than its
normal life expectancy, which can have an adverse affect on your
life expectancy, can be seen by taking a close look at as many sewn
foot gibbs as you can and noting their general condition. Enough
of this, back to the foot points.
Once you've figured out this knot, just make another and the
rig is half done, I'm not going to put dimensions in this article
because I don't think that is appropriate. Cavers come in too many
sizes and flavors to attempt to include dimensions. Just use your
head: one should be low, the other should be higher, and the
difference is the step you can take. Ain't no big thaing, just
fiddle with it.
The roller on our rig is a simmons racing roller. The nine
inch bar allows a more upright stance without squeezing the
ribcage. It's aluminum, so it doesn't weigh that much. It's a bit
awkward but I have a large vertical pack, (many of us do) and on
a drop of any appreciable length I feel the additional comfort and
speed is well worth the effort of carrying it. The chest harness
is a standard layout with shoulder straps and again a minimum of
sewing. The chest strap is one and a half inch solid webbing. A
continuous belt is snaked through the two big slots on the chest
plate with the buckle on the right side (for right handers). The
motion to tighten should be pulling forward so that you can tighten
it yourself while on rope. Note that there are secondary buckle
plates available which allow the assembly of this portion without
any sewing at all. (I really do hate sewing.) The shoulder straps
are a continuous piece of one inch webbing running from one side
of the chest plate back through a D-ring and forward to an
adjustment buckle on the other side of the chest plate. The D-ring
is attached to a webbing loop sliding on the chest webbing. This,
arrangement is completely adjustable to any size person if the
strap ends are left long enough.
OK now class, what's missing? Yes the bungee cords. Where
do you hook the bungee cords? Well, we use a continuous piece of
shock cord. No big surprise yet, but we run it behind our backs
to a one inch steel ring hung just below the sliding D-ring on the
back of the chest harness. A pulley would just screw up back there
and the cord doesn't really slide that much after going around your
hips. The ring just makes the system self adjusting. The more
typical shock cord attachment to the front of the chest harness
worsens the tendency which the roller has to pull down while the
back attachment counteracts this. The attachment to the cam is
important too. Since the pull is up and to the side, the shock
cord should be tied in a loose loop which goes around the cam
portion of the gibbs. Not to the shell, not through the cam, not
even on the cam, but around the cam. This tends to open the cam
as it slides up and close it as the webbing is pulled down. The
result is less friction with a corresponding reduction in wear on
