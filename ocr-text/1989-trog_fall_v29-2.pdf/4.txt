The Editors' Column
You'd think we'd donc enough without writing a damn editors' column that no one wants to
read anyhow, but tradition calls for us to have our own B.S. space. By the way, this is Kay
speaking. Joe is off in typing hell at the moment.
It's interesting having co-editors. On one hand, it's nice to share the work and blame. On
the other hand, it's easy to assume the other editor is or is not doing something editorial, and
communication can be a problem. Of course this is the Club publication which we could not
do without your help and the trainee article requirement. Thanks muchly! We have received
plenty of interesting stuff, and the handwritten articles were even decipherable! The one
thing we really need are cartoons and pictures. Any artists out there please step forward. Id
love to have some cave clip art.
So I guess being an editor is a mix of duties. You get to bug people to do things they
already know they should be doing. Officers are a particularly troublesome bunch, especially
ex-officers. Then you get to spend all sorts of time typing and putting it all together. Now I
suppose I should put in the disclaimer about opinions not being those of the Trog and that all
information is not real in the first place. I'm glad Kay is on the team, it makes the job easier
and fun. Long live Mac's! Well folks, read on and enjoy.
GRIPE!
GRIPE!
BITCH!
BITCH!
