NOTES ON A REALLY FAST SRT SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T SMASH,
MAIM, AND MANGLE BOOBS, BALLS, AND OTHER SENSITIVE
BODY PARTS QUITE AS BADLY AS THE OTHERS DO

Paul (Bertas' husband) Kirchman
Since Berta and I developed our rigs in preparation for a
Mexico trip during the summer of '87, I have been repeatedly
requested to write it up. Now that Berta holds the womens' world
records in just about everything mechanical using essentially the
same rig, the requests have become demands, threats, and finally
action. Yes action from a lazy slob like me. You see my pubic
hairs have been super-glued to this keyboard and a bottle of
solvent is mine when I finish. There is a solvent for this stuff
isn't there? You know it's not that easy to type in this position
but I've got a lot of incentive now. Oooch!!
First, the feet. Gibbs ascenders are used here for their
ability to operate consistently while unattended. Also important
is the availability of replacement parts as this is the highest
wear point in the rig. Both feet are attached as floating points,
identical except in length. This technique is not new and is
referred to as the double bungee system. The immediate advantage
of this system is that a normal stride is allowed without the
twisting of the foot that occurs when the gibbs is attached
directly to it. The most common complaint of this type of system
is that a shorter step is allowed because of the higher foot point.
My only answer is that it doesn't seem to slow Berta down too much.
Each foot cam is tied from one inch tubular webbing and no it
doesn't hurt my feet. I run in sneakers all the time, Berta set
the records in sneakers, and you can't even notice the difference - ..
in good caving boots. The basis of our foot cam is the Frost knot.
Simply make two bights in a piece of webbing, one up one down, one
has the cam on it and the other should be big enough for your foot
plus whatever type of footwear you intend to use. The webbing
should be laid flat together and in the center will be three layers
thick. Make an overhand in this part and you have a Frost knot.
Be sure that the big overhand points away from your ankle. Trust
me, if you screw it up you'll know in the first ten feet of
climbing. Leave the ends long enough to tie around your ankle for
chicken loops and you have a foot cam that requires no (yes, I said
no) sewing. Berta prefers to sew her chicken loops on but that is
minimal. The point here is that spares can be tied in very little
time which is important because for Berta these cams are a
maintenance item and a complicated sewn foot point would be out of
the question.
This brings up a pet peeve of mine (I have a lot of pet peeves
but I'm only going to gripe about this one today). Extensive
sewing in a rig, no matter how well it is done, eventually becomes
a safety hazard. We cavers are, in general, a lazy lot. It may
