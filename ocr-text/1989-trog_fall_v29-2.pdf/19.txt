Comfo 3 Point Chin Strap
This is an alternative design for the chin straps that come with the MSA comfo cap and
related helmets. This suspension is designed to hold the helmet on more securely than the
original two point elastic suspension.
Materials:
- One 3/4 inch Fastex ladder lock buckle
- Two 3/4 inch D rings
- Three 3/4 inch Fastex tri-glides
- Ideally 4 feet of 3/4 inch webbing (Climbing grade not required)
Construction:
Step 1. Cut elastic band from plastic attachments.
Step 2- Sew buckle #2 as shown in figure 1. Make sure that webbing is attached to proper
point on buckle.
Step 3- Sew buckle # 2 as shown in figure 2. Make sure that strap is cut at an angle as
shown for easier threading.
Step 4. To attach to helmet, find middle of remaining webbing, lacing it around headband
adjustment on helmet and through the tri-glide. (fig. 3)
Step 5- Slide on buckle #1 and #2 onto each webbing tail. (fig. 3)
Step 6- Slide a tri-glide on 7 1/2 inches from headband tri-glide. (fig. 3) Be sure that it is
on in the opposite way of the headband tri-glide.
Step 7- Thread webbing through plastic attachment and back through tri-glide. (fig. 4) Do
this for each tail. Make sure that the webbing going from the D ring to the plastic
attachment is on the inside. (fig. 5) It is very important that the webbing is threaded
right so the helmet will ride right
Step 8- Adjust suspension to fit, and trim excess webbing.
Notes:
To put helmet on, pinch straps at D rings making sure there are no twists in the webbing.
Slide helmet on and fasten buckle. After a few times with it on you will learn how it is
supposed to feel.
Do not consider this to be equivalent to a 4 point suspension; if any part of the webbing gets
cut, the whole setup comes undone. The suspension's only purpose is to better hold the
helmet on your head.
To quick release the ladder lock, peel it away from your face with your thumb and
forefinger.
I suggest using a small piece of cord to keep the rear point centered. Tie it around the
webbing loop and through the holes in the adjustment band.
Also, you can put the webbing in a sheath of 2 inch tubular webbing to help make the whole
thing more comfortable. This suspension can be annoying because of the way it rubs the ears.
Alternate Materials:
In place of the ladder lock you can use a regular Fastex buckle or a Fastex cam buckle, but
I've found that the ladder lock is the most comfortable because of its small size.
In place of the D rings you can use Fastex loop-locs, but I don't know how well they would
work.
Alternate Design:
I also have a design for an actual 4 point suspension similar to this one. It requires more
sewing, but is a much better design. I didn't publish it because I have not made one yet, but if
you would like to try it instead, I can give it to you.
