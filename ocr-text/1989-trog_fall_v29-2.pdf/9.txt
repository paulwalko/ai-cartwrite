Escape From New Jersey
12:20 PM - Finish packing. Dad makes a nice gesture, generously offers to buy a tank of gas for the
Corolla while I grab breakfastlunch before the trip. I neglect to tell him his spare Exxon card has
bought every drop of gas that has gone into the car for the last six months.
12:35 - Barely able to move from mom's "light snack", I stagger out to the car, hoping that the repair
job I did on the gas tank holds.
12:37 - Just before turning the ignition switch, hope that the repair job on the starter holds. Ditto for
the radiator, vacuum hoses, and really, really shiny front tires.
12:38 - As car warms up, realize that my New Jersey passport (the one with the picture of Jimmy
Hoffa on the back) is lying on my dresser next to the thank you letter from the Kiwi Fruit Growers
Association. Debate trying to fasthalk the border guards with words like Brandenburg and
Peristroika. Envision a burly guard tapping on the hood of my car, what does dat old blimp
accident have to do with ya trying to leave da state? I think ya betta just get outta da car, Buddy.* |
have a brief, cinematic flash of the guard leading me away in shackles past a drug-sniffing dog lying
unconscious next to one of my bags.
12:41 -- Passport and papers safely on the passenger seat I gun the car and head out the driveway.
Looking back I can just see mom waving good bye through a cloud of blue smoke.
12:52 - Just before I leave town, I cruise down Main Street and look around. The garbage is blowing
past the prostitutes as the homeless weave down the street muttering to themselves. Ah, home.
1:31 - As try to pull out onto +80. I notice that the traffic is bumper-to-bumper as usual.
Bumper-to-bumper going 75 miles per hour, that is.
2:05 â€“ Traffic thins out a bitI can think a little more clearly I look in my rear view to see whether I'm
leaving a gas slick behind me. Seeing none, I flash St. Christopher the thumbs up and gun the
Corolla pasta semi loaded with bridge parts on a down hill.
2:24 - Another impatient jerk passes on the right. I comfort myself with the thought that Saab, BMW,
turbo, and Mercedes are all synonyms for'asshole" in Swahili.
4:10-Snap out of a serious case of road hypnotism as I realize I'm leaving Pennsytvania and
have absolutely no memory of the last fifty miles.
4:16-Bladder says "Oi!" Realize that I could make a fortune if I could develop a caffeinated coffee
with non-diuretic properties.
4:48 - Pull into a place, either in Winchester or in Martinsburg, that is proof that god exists; an Exxon
station, a Burger King, and a Dunkin' Donuts, right next to each other, within spitting distance of the
highway. Gas, pee, caffeine, water, and donuts, in fast succession. Hell is a long road trip with
people who haven't learned to Synchronize the needs of their car, stomach, and bladder.
5:03 - Munch donuts, and sip an Ultra Big Dunkin' Donuts Coffee Gulp. Ponder the age-old
philosophical question: If a tree falls over in a forest and no one is there to see it or hear it does it
make a noise? No, wait What if the only person in the forest was Helen Keller... No, even better, it
Helen Keller is walking in the forest going crazy trying to read a piece of stucco tile, and then she
falls over....
5:56 - As I watch the odometer turn 167,000 miles, I shake my head in amazement at the durability of
this little wisp of green paint and iron oxide. I feel a little strange about driving something that's gone
