Thus, when I took in a total of five quarts of water
during and after a climb, I should have taken in salt equal
to 30 tablets, I had taken in the equal of say 10 tablets
in my food, leaving a deficit of 20 tablets, which I should
have taken as I drank the water.
In the event this quantity of salt seems large to you,
let us look at some direct quotations from the medical lit-
erature:
Newbangh: Physiology of Heat Regulation, Chapter 5, by
Robinson, p. 218: Pigh rates of sweating in unacclimated men
may result in the loss of considerable salt (20 grams or 40
tablets daily) and leads to deficiency, Salt deficiency
frequently leads to heat cramps. Even moderate deficiencies
contribute to disturbances of heart-blood vessel functions
and may lead to heat exhaustion, seat cramps may develop
when large volumes of sweat are produced and the water loss
is restored without replacing the salt loss,
ilkerson: Medicine for mountaineering, P.135: Re-
currence of muscle cramps (heat cramps) can be prevented by
providing a daily supplement of 10 to 20 grams ( 20 to 40
tablets of 0.5 grams each) of salt and a generous fluid
intake.
Ruch Ś Patton: Physiology Biophysics, Chapter 45 by
Noodbury, p.893-4: Sweating rates as high as 1,5 quarts
per hour over several hours have been reported although such
high rates are not maintained. The salt concentration in
the sweat is about 3.5 grams (7 salt tablets) per quart.
Practical Comments: The first quart of sweat gets its
salt from food,
2 Don't take salt if you don't have water, concentrated
salt in the digestive system will pull water from the blood
stream and make you even more dehydrated,
Conversely, don't take lots of water if you don't
take a proportionate amount of salt. Plain water in the
digestive system will pull salt from the blood stream and
make your muscles even more salt deficient, leading to
muscle cramp.
Anticipate your need for water and salt. If the day
is going to be hot, start to take salt tablets as soon as
you start to sweat. Don't wait for a party-delaying emer-
gency to occur.
Ome Daiber has told us that headache is often a symp-
tom of salt deficiency.
One salt tablet per cup full of water is about right
to supplement the salt obtained from food. You can guess
close enough because the kidneys will adjust the ratio
for you by excreting water or salt, whichever is in excess,
Use wax-impregnated salt tablets to avoid gastric dis-
tress. The plain tablets (Thermotabs) dissolve a bit too
fast and can be upsetting. morton Salt makes wax-impreg-
nated tablets, which dissolve slower, but only in 1,000
tablet packages, To fill the need, we are repackaging in
60 tablet vials, If you want waxed tablets to dissolve
faster, crush the tablet before swallowing (with water),
