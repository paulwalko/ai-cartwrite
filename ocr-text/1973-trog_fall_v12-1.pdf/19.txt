five quarts of water for rehydrating and took
only one salt tablet. That evening, my leg muscle

How to Judge Sweat wuantity: Profuse sweat-
ing is the condition in which the entirė skin is
moist and drops of sweat run down the face. The
rate is roughly one quart per hour. It is best
measured by weight loss but since you don't have
scales with you, 'keep track of the total amount
of fluid you drink per day, including the rehys
dration period in the evening. Roughly two quarts
of this was lost in respiration and excretion and
the balance was lost in sweat.
Remember that a dry breeze (hot or cold) can
evaporate sweat quickly. Your sweat rate may be
up but you may not notice it. Short-term thirst
in enough salt to replace losses, you probably
will not take in enough water (at the time of
sweating) even though it is available, and you
. Salt Content of Sweat Sweat varies in salt
content according to how profuse the sweating is.
At low rates, salt is reabsorbed into the sweat
ducts, and salt supplement is not needed. At high
rates, this recapture is less effective and the
salt content can easily reach the equal of six
salt tablets "per quart, (0.5 grams or 8 grains
sodium chloride per: tablet.)
