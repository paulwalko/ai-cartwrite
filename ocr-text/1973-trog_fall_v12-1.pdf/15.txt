Recently, articles have appeared in several grotto
publications discussing the choice of a camera for
speleo-photography. These articles have dealt mainly
with the range finder 35 m.m. cameras which are small:
and relatively inexpensive (560-$200). The main point
of these articles was that these cameras were just the
thing to buy for speleo-photography since they could be
stuck in a cave pack without crowding and be adequately
protected from moisture by a plastic bag. Now, for the
most part, this is true, but I contend that other con-
siderations may make this approach distasteful, if not
impossible, to the average caver. Here's why:
1. "How many cameras do you own?" For most people, the
answer is "one," most people are unwilling or unable to
buy a camera, just for caving, and instead buy an all-
purpose camera, usually a 35 m.m. single lens reflex.
Most cameras in this category are bulkier, heavier, and
more expensive than the rangefinder 35's and their
owners are not likely to trust them to the questionable
protection of a canvas cave back and 7 plastic bag.
2. "How close can you focus?" If you want to look a
bat in the eye, or get a really good shot of those tiny
gypsum needles, you nees to get really close. The range-
finder 35's, with a few expensive exceptions, have perma-
nently mounted lenses. This, coupled with the inevitable
parallax problem, makes difficult or impossible the use
of accessories such as close-up lenses, extension tubes,
or bellows. Also wide-angle and telephoto lenses, etc.
are impossible.
For these reasons, if you own, or are planning to own,
a 35 m.m. S2R or a larger-format camera, you will sooner
or later wind up carrying it in an ammo box.
Now, there are many disadvantages to an ammo box as
a camera case; weight, bulk, and the fact that most
de ople find them hard to pack. The overwhelming advan-
tages are that an ammo box is water and dust proof and
virtually indestructible. To get around that "hard to
pack" angle, here's how to custom-fit your ammo box to
your camera, and accessories,
... First, start with a 5.56 m.m. ammo box rather than
the smaller 30 cal. box. This will allow more generous
use of Dadding around the camera and still leave room
for plenty of extra goodies,
