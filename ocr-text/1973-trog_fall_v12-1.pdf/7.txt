get the grotto back on its feet as a respectable caving group.
The question isn't "Where do we go from here?", but
"Where will the new cavers go from here?"
It's up to us.

How would you respond to the question:
"Do you want to go caving?"
a. No, there is a party tonight; besides I have a
hangover from last night's party.
b. Not me, I don't cave, I just like hanging around
the cave club.
C. I don't cave any more, I am too old for that now,
just remember, someday : you will be like me.
Your answer, I hope, would be affirmative; if not, I
hope your excuse is not any of the above,
also, look at the people who helped me put this Trog
together and notice how many of them cave, They are more
than just cavers. Thanks for the help. .
