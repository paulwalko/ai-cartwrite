::. You should now have a compartmental case which
will allow you easy and quick access to all your equid-
ment, while protecting it from all but the most severe
shock. "I have dropped a camera packed like this 15 feet
in a. cave, onto rocks with no damage at all.
In closing, a few helpful hints for living with a
camera, in a case:
. --Use a ?" "strap' for carrying your ammo box. Sight
hours of hard caving with a 15 pound box on a 1" strap
on your shoulder is enough to make anyone give up speleo-
photography.
-In all but the cleanest of caves, Ã  lens brush, lens
tissue, and lens cleaner are not merely useful, but vital;
at least, if you like your camera they arei
...most cave shots are ruined by under-exposure. When
in doubt, open ud another f-stop.
-Remember, just because your camera is in a padded
ammo box, this does not mean it will survive a fall down
the entrance of Fig ole, Spare it all the bumps you can
and don't let others carry it for you unless they realize
how delicate it is.
-Iastly, take your time. Caves like to have their
pictures taken and are usually willing to wait until you
get set up for a good shot, so do it up right, and use
your imagination.
''Then your rcpe gets even a little dirty, wash it in a
machinewasher using handwarm water. The reason for using
hand-warm water (not over 110F) is not that a higher
temperature is harmful but that nylon becomes stiff while
it is it higher temperatures and the rope needs to flex
the dirt out.
