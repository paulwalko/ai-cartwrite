"'ISCALCULATIONS
In June of 1944; Mitler stubbornly concentrated
all his Panzers in the wrong place at the wrong time ;
he lost the war.
In December: of 1973; certain members of the VPI
Cave Club stubbornly concentrated all their vertical
gear in the wrong place at the wrong time; it it was
only through the magnificent efforts of four who chal-
lenged that a particular cave was not lost. This is
their story:
Starting around 0900 hours, two bold trainees, one
at the Aux, Dump and one at his dorm, started preparing
for their journey. Vhile the former met with resistance
organizing the rest of the recon group, the latter found
out that the departure would be detained from 1000 to
1100 hours. Eventually, the group got organized. In a
frenzy of activity, each member separated to perform his
function. Py 1115 hours, our group re-united to obtain
sustinence. Je were approuching zero hour.
Thile preparing to push off, circa 1200 hours, we
encountered the opposition: The Clover Hollow Clan. It
was they who had taken all the vertical gear that we so
desperately needed, Despite our pleas and threats, they
resolutely withheld our necessary gear. They departed and
left us helpless,
Dejected and demoralized, we sullenly departed on our
voyage. Thile enroute, we decided on a mode of revenge
on the Clover Hollow Clan. We would intercept them at
their destination and replace their ladder with a rope.
Ve altered our route accordingly and came upon the members
of the evil Clover Hollow Clan procrastinating at the
entrance. With the element of suprise on our side (even
though we had been somewhat taken back by the slowness of
our adversary), we approuched recklessly. With fear in
their putrid hearts; the greedy enemy cavers retreated
in disorder. It was only when they were rallied by fear-
less Perkins (the arbeiter) and fearfull Jones (the
ersatz-fuhrer) that we had a challenge.
Going quickly into action, our Co-captain raced to
the fore to face the foe. The enemy, thus confronted,
tried peaceful means as a solution. While they engaged our
Co-captain in heated debate, the remaining members of our
party, due to attrition, suffered. I, taking on my respon-
sibilities, joined in the discussion.
When we learned that the opposition needed rope and
carbide, we decided to be kind (for the initiative was now
ours) and deal with them. In a quick action, led by myself
acting for my side, and Perkins acting for the other, we
made a deal. Ve gave up a heap of carbide and an immensely
long rope and two packs of lucky crackers in turn for two
dirty, grubby cable ladders. Though successful in our
mission, we felt cheated; but we conquered our cave and
that's what counts, A magnificent finish,
