I would like to take this opportunity to express
some thoughts to the new people we have within the club.
First of all welcome, and I'm glad to see that you've
stuck with the club, 'You've all been around a quarter
now and have been exposed to the basics of vertical and
horizontal caving along with obtaining some idea of how
the club opderates. Now it time to look towards the
rest of the year.
One of the things that you might be asking yourself
is where do we go from here. ?y this I mean, "what else
does caving have to offer or what else can I do besides
just going caving." Undoubtably if you've been around the
club at all you've heard some things said about cave
surveying' and mapping. Possibly you've been on a mapping
trip and have gathered some insight to the rudiments of
mapping." If you haven't and like everyone else hăve a
thousand and one questions, such as how to map, why map,
what equipment to use, etc.; then all I can say for the
time-being is to be patient. riext quarter. I hope to see
some programs given on mapping along with some mapping
sessions in order to acquaint people with some of the
methods and equipment in
· Intertwined with these programs will be programs by
various öeople as to certain pet projects in which they
are involved. As to why. to map, you can only answer that
for yourself. The reason I can't answer this for you is
because it leads to other areas of caving about which you
must formulate you own philosophies. An example is the
area of conservation, and today the questions are coming
thick and fast. Such questions as,"why map, why publish
maps, and how do we limit the output of published material"
are being hotiy debated throughout the region. This is
a major problem today and rightly so since the future of
caves and caving rests on how we handle the problems of
vandalism, land owner relations and other conservation
oriented problems in retrospect to ourselves and rebel
cävers. I have my own views. Other people in the club
have their own views. I think it would be worth your
while to talk to various members and search out their views
with regard to this subject since it would give you a
broader background with which to approach this problem.
I also recommend that if you can, borrow a member's or the
club's copy of the last issue of the Region Record since
it has an excellent survey done by Annie hittemore on .
some ideas of conservation.
If the idea of mapping doesn't particularly interest
you, there are still other aspects to explore. Various
people in the club are well experienced in the areas of
