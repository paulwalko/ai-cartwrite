In addition to an ammo box, you will need corregated
cardboard, " foam, glue, and tape. The 1" foam is the
easiest size to work with and is most easily cut with an
electric carving knife or a ripple-edged bread knife.
Corrugated cardboard is used here because it is cheap;
absorbs shock, and will help soak up any water that might
get into the case.
First, cut a piece of cardboard to fit the bottom of
the box. Then cut a piece for each side, making these
pieces slightly oversize. Put the bottom piece in and
then jam the side pieces in so that all five pieces are
held firmly in place by friction.
now place your camera (without leather case) into
the box with the largest body dimension up. On 35" SIR'S,
this means standing the camera, ud on its side with the
back parallel to the sides of the box. Cut and place
accross the box a partition to divide the camera, half
from the accessory half of the box. Vhen doing this DOS-
itioning, allow for an extra layer of cardboard at the
bottom and ton of the camera.
Now you should have the box lined with cardboard
(fig. 1) and divided into two parts. The object now is
to add strips of cardboard to the camera section to take
up the space unused by the camera so as to leave the
camera in a snug fitting slot, supported by the body, not
the lens. : Those strips of cardboard can be cut to shape
and then glued or taped together, then glued or taped into
place,
The camera is now taken out, and a piece of foam is
cut to fit the bottom of this space. After putting the
foam in the camera is replaced. The upper side of the
camera should now be within " of the top of the box; if
not, add more foam or cardboard on the bottom. It should
be noted that the space under the lens should be filled so
that the body is snugly held, but the cardboard should
not touch the lens; instead a piece of foam should be
glued here to support the lens. The space between the
lens and the side of the box should be filled with card-
board, but the lens should not quite touch it. This is
to avoid damaging the lens if the box is dropped. Now
the box should resemble fig. 2 and 2a. Note that the
foam is used only in a horizontal position. Vertical
pieces of foam tend to catch on camera corners and con-
tacts and make the camera a. bitch to get in and out of
the box. Cut cardboard edges may be covered with elec-
trical tane to give a smoother surface.
The accessory half of the box may now be divided up
in the same way, with seperate compartments for each
accessory. ?uild up the bottom so that each accessory
is Å¾" from the top of the box:
A piece of cardboard is now cut to fit the top of the
box and built up with strips of cardboard and foam to take
up the space above the camera and accessories. This top
should fit snugly into the box and a handle of avalanche
cord may be fitted to the top of it to facilitate removal
(see fig. 3)
