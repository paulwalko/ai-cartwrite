cave photography, the cave sciences (for example, if you
like creepy crawlers), first aid, and rescue work just to
mention a few. whichever path you choose to follow now
is up to you. All I can say is I, along with the rest of
the members, will try to expose you to the different
possibilities. Put you, in turn, have to come up to us
and ask us questions, prompt us, and hound us until you
get a question answered.
I just want to add one thing. This year we have a
good bunch of trainies. The future of the club is up to
you and I think you can really help the clubRight now,
the best way you can help the club is to study and pull
good grades. You're up here for an education and you sure
aren't going to help the club if you flunk out. If you
have to pass up a trip.or" miss.'à nights of drinking toget
some thing done, do it, Contrary to what some people
might say, grades and studies are important.
In closing, I just want to say keep up the good work
and good luck.

Where do we go from here? Hell, where were we to start
with? Approximately 320 of the regular members have been car-
ing more than twice this quarter, and three-fouths of the
officers are not in this category. rïow can we expect' trainees
to be enthusiastic cavers when they see as many of the club's
members just hanging on and contributing so very little to the
club asa caving organization? Vith such poor examples, no
wonder we have some trainees who seem to be here for the party-
ing and shy away from caving. Trainees see this as an activity
accepted by other "cavers",
Other negative aspects result: from this caving stagna-
tion, many trainees want to cave, but can find no one to take
them. 5o we have trainees that have been caving only two or
three times. And we wonder why there are so many "rebel"
cavers? What are YCU offering a new caver? Sure, studying is
important, but I wonder if there is any cirriculum that re-
quires the constant attention as some people claim to give,
Our reputation within (and outside) the region and rumors
bad mouthing the grotto are a favorite topic of conversation,
and raises some blood pressure. But what have we done to dis-
prove: these claims? That impression of the club have YOU given
at a gathering of covers? Here you able to talk about a re-
cent cave trin, or a recent party? Think about it.
Yes, there are skills such as mapping for trainees to
learn, but who will teach them? We have new caves to check
out, leads to push and ridges to walk, so lets see some act-
ivity in the grotto next quarter. Drag out those old clothes
and polish up the reflector. Take a trainee caving. Don't
just sit and call yourself a caver, go out and be one. Iets
