to jump on us and asphyxiate us. It was only through
sheer determination that our party kept going. We crawled
through a slim, muddy crawlway into the room where the
chain-gate was put up and it was here that our first trag-
edy almost occured. The victim was Jim Denton. He was
the last one through the crawlway and as he was nearing
the end both I ynn and Carol started singing:
"I'm "en-er-y the eighth I am, Hen-er-y the eighth
I am, I am, etc., etc..."
It was apparent that Denton was riled, "ie had :)
stopped crawling along and was now huddled in abject
terror of the sounds issuing forth from in front.
"Second verse-same as the first"
"I'm Yen-er-y the eighth I am, ten-er-y the eighth
I am, I am..."
"S-+-U-T ---U-P:.:" bellows from out of the hole (Note:
the duration of time that the words "shut-up" engulfed
would have been enough to allow a normal person to recite
all the names of the people in the cave club who are cur-
rently flunking at least one course).
Peace is restored to the subterranean depths and
somehow I got the impression that the Great God of Caving
was grateful for the restored silence. My suspicions
were confirmed when I noted that the chain did not try
to grab anybody when we crawled by it. Thus, the journey
continues. Stepping into the cold water of the run, I
couldn't help feeling some impending incident of iriporam
tance concerning the stream yet to be faced. So everyone
started on down the stream (everyone except Denton, Lynn,
and Carol: I wonder what they were doing back there?).
Eventually, they caught up with the rest of us and we
quickly reached our final destination--the back room.
Mike Wolf had said that there were no other passages out
of the room, but that we could look around and enjoy our-
selves. I found one little crawl that went from in front
of the stream at one end of the room, around behind a mob
of mud, and emerged at the other end of the room. I en-
joyed this crawl so much that I went through it three
times.
Carol and I ynn went off exploring down a little
passage and I followed out of curiosity (about the cave).
e reached the end of that crawl and Volf came down after
us, followed by another trainee. We sat around and sang
songs for ten minutes. The most fascinating item we saw
in this sewerish (in shape only) passage was a spider
first noticed by Tolf, This particular spider was cling-
ing upside down to the stalactites and seemed to be
performing some sort of ritual over I or rather, under)
one small nobule. The spider was moving up and down in a
rythmic manner that was not dis-similer to the rutting
