ROLF ACQUEARY
Eyes openii, dusty beams pour in
and a maelstrom of colors, haize,
and thought fragments slow and
disperse into a white plaster cracked sky.
The old timer awakens.
He lays there at first, finding it
a bit difficult to move, a feeling
he has been all too familiar with
ever since that time. His head
pounds slighty and fleeting images
of the past force him to he still,
He finds it difficult to separate
dreams from reality. He knows no

one to share tales or illusions or
anything. He is looked upon as senile;
an eccentric, fading also into distant
atmosphere. By his side a tarnished
lamp sits. Its flame grows dim...
