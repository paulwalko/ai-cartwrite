AN UNBIASEO KERORT BY
MKE VIOLE
It was a dark, dead night. The lonely farm house
of Bob Page, Steve Kerk and Joe Yeats sat on the fog enshourded
hillside. There was evil in the air. Something strange was
going on inside the house, whatever it was, it was loud
enough to wake the dead.
It was walloween, the V.P.I. Cave Club was celebrating
the pagan holiday with an equally pagan party the likes of
which had never before been seen on the face of the earth.
The party was attended by the usual horde of ghosts, goblins,
rednecks, dirty old men and Dennis Webb. Among the more
unusual costumes was that of Bill Stringfellow who came as a
hooker. Many a guy had to take a second look to make sure it
was Bill under the blond wig, make-up and custom-made G-string.
mark Slusarski, one of our distinguished graduates, made an
appearance as a Polish gladiator, wearing a suit of armor made

he would be the one with the most money on his name by party
time and thus win Bill as a date for the night. Needless to
say, everybodys' "favorite" guy turned out to be our own
President, Tuna Johnson,
The party was not without some unusual entertainment.
In a quick one round fight, Slugger Dam Douty won a victory
for womens' lib against trainee Tom Doyle with a quick right
to the stomach. Toms' stomach did the rest by bringing up
what he had been drinking for the last few hours. He spent
the next few minutes hanging from the front porch, looking
kind of green. Steve Kark did a fine job as disc jockey with
the 73 Panquet Party Tape. Steve kept the party going
between songs with witty remarks, nasty jokes and interviews
with such personalities as Ed Loud and Doug Perkins.
The party lasted well into the morning hours with every-
one having a great time, About 3 a.me people started dropping
like flies. Some found their way to a cozy corner, others
