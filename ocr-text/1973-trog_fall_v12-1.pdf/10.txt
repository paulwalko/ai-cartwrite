motion of mammals. Yolf didn't quite use that express-
ion; rather, he described it as if the spider was per-
forming a solitary self-sexual act upon itself. In a
flash, everyone else in the passage was craning their
necks to see this fascinating phenomena. I thought it.
was in rather poor taste for the male members to watch,
in as much as this was a female spider, Carol, after
having satiated her curiosity, crawled over the three other
cavers who were blocking her exit and led us out..
Then came the big event. Several people were crawl-
ing around in a hole in the cave floor and I jumped down
to look around. I found a small crawl where the stream
flowed and I splashed into it. Woll came down to see
what I had found and was really thrilled (Gee," he said,
"It really goes:"). We decided it should be explored,
but we debated about seriously going further; for neither
one of us had enoug!? of an equatic nature to go get
soaked. He called for someone small to push it, but all
we got was Denton. Our noble trip-meister felt it was his
duty to explore all routes. Not wanting to get his clothes
wet, he removed them. One of the male trainees did like-
wise. I felt it was safer to leave and did so. Then
Denton crawled into the crawlway, Mike Wolf was heard to
utter some thing to the effect of "My God What is this?"
I had had the sense to get out of that den of damnation
early and was not really suprised when Carol, goaded on
by her partner, also removed her clothing. Denton pushed
until the cave pushed back and emerged from the hole he
had pushed to see, sitting serenely on a rock, giggling,
Carol, Volf, too, emerged to a similar scene, but he was
coaxed out by we sane people above. From above it was
really an (uh) interesting scene. Three naked bodies
moving and contorting below in the half-light of our dis-
tant carbide lamps.
Well, so much for fun and games, I said to myself.
I started to put my shirt and pants back on (having taken
them off to wring them out) only to find that the cave was
still trying to kill me. This time it tried to give me
pneumonia by dripping all over my almost dry clothing.
I had lynn cook my feet with her carbide lamp, but the
people below didn't know this. I said (concerning her
lamp): "Don't move it back and forth, hold it still".
I was asked what she was doing and replied: "She's warm-
ing my toes." This was greated with many jeers and shouts.
ut that was it. We went back. Yolf and I tried to
go upstream only to have the cave throw mud at us and
stick our noses in the dirt. We got slopped and came back,
Ieaving was an anti-climax except for my finding a flow-
stone slide board. I crawled out through the hard way
and the cave pulled its foothold out from under me (that
little devil) and sent me sprawling. With a last drive
of effort I pulled my foot from the cave's tenacious
grasp and crawled free. We got out--all present and
accounted for after spending two and a half hours battling
Chernobog and his demons in their own realm. That a feati
