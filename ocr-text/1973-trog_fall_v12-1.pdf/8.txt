50 there I was, all prepared to freeze myself by
going with Denton to see ageless Jim Hixon, I had heard
enough rumors about this sage to truly whet my curiosity.
?ut the fates were against me as Denton developed a pass-
iona te urge to try to pass his calculus course by study-
ing over the weekend.
At the meeting, Mike Wolf announced that he and
Denton were going to Spruce mountain Run (also called
Spruce Run Mountain: and I don't care which is right)
and I leant at the opportunity to go with this dynamic
duo and see them in action.
The trin started off rather slowly with the gather-
ing of participants and gear the most time consuming.
Once on the road everything was dandy with various excit-
ing events occuring; singing all the songs we could, and
coasting down all the hills to conserve gas (and, in the
process, to block traffic). As we neared the cave, we
rolled merrily along; turned around and rolled merrily
back (we missed the cave). Not seeing it on our pass
back, we turned again and gallently dashed forward, only
to miss it again. On the next try we found the road
(which had been marked for us as being on the other side
of the road) and Denton roared right up the hill with all
the precision of a finely tuned pogo-stick. It was then
that we learned that Mike Wolf had been there before but
forgot how to get there (in the words of the trip-
meister: "'damn it, Wolf;").
After a brisk walk up the road, and a brisk search
to find the cave (a search in which one member was tempo
orarily briskly lost from us), we plunged into the depth.
I, of course, prayed to the Great God of Caving to see us
through and allow us the pleasures of his vast depths.
Looking back now, I can see that it was in vain that I
should have asked for guidance. Had I known what pains
and degrecations lay ahead I would have cursed him and
left the cave then and there. Put that is looking back
and at the time I was looking ahead--to make sure that
I didn't smash my face into some fool overhanging rock
that was waiting for me. I knew that the God was against
this trin very quickly. "Ty initial realization came when,
going down the first incline to the first room, a rock
jumped at my foot and bit it,
Well, it was all down hill from there. The cave
started throwing things at us from a bove and tried to
suck us down from below. As the roof closed in from above
to crush us, the little piles of rat-turds that were scat-
tered all about scuttled around beneath our hands trying
