Normal urinary output should be an ounce, an hour
while hiking or climbing. If less than that, there is
risk of dehydration with reduced physical performance. In
other words, make it a habit to drink more water than thirst
indicates (taking salt also if sweating or rehydrating from
sweating), .
. Remember that salt loss : on a Saterday on the approach
march which is not made up that night can lead to cramps,
heat exhaustion and reduced performance the next day on
the climb
General Comments: "That about POTASSIUM? It is a fad,
just now, to lace beverages with potassium because cator-
ade did it. But potassium loss in sweat is low, and potas-
sium is plentiful in foods such as fruits (including dates,
and raisins), rice, potatoes, nuts, lentils, peas, meat,
chocolate, and many others. A normal diet has enough
potassium to provide for 6-8. quarts of sweat; so you don't
normally need to be concerned about potassium deficit,
Exception: If you are not taking food normally, as
in the case of lack of appetite, vomiting or diarrhea, large
amounts of both sodium and potassium will be lost and a
doctor may wish to advise supplements. Conditions like
this are beyond the scope of this article.
"Electrolyte". beverages: Dilute orange juice, made
from frozen concentrate, is an excellent climbing bev-
erage, Add 1/3 level teaspoon salt (2 grams) per quart,
if you have been sweating, and then you have an alej.èctróna
lyte drink." You do not take salt tablets with this
beverage, Similarly with indol-itid, etc,
Gatorade, by contrast, has only 0.6 grams, of salt per
quart. If you need 10 grams of supplemental salt, you have
to drink 16 quarts of Gatorade to get it. This is not easy.
Vany powdered drink mixes are available. Read the
labels and do your arithmetic. If the label does not tell
you the salt and calorie content, write to the manufacturer.
If you don't know these numbers, you don't know where you
are in slat management, Include calorie calculations,
because you don't want to displace a balanced diet by pure
sugar, Suppose you do drink six quarts of the stuff, and the
calorie content is 400 per quart. You would then be getting
2,400 calories from sugar alone. This is not good food
management.
Acclimatization: The body adjusts gradually over
10-20 days of daily profuse sweating to conserve salt.
Accordingly, supplemental salt need starts to decrease after
the first few days. You probably won't need more than just
salty food after acclimatization.
Our gratitude to the following doctors who have
patiently guided us in preparing this article:

writing a full report which will be published by us as a
pamphlet later,
Dr. James_Burnell, Kidney specialist, Seattle, who
has researched sodium and potassium metabolism for 20 years.
