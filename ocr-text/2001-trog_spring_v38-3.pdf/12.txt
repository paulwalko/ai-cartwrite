bleh," he said.
Although Easter Beer is based on the
enjoyment of adults, that doesn't preclude kids
from joining in on the fun. Several club
members brought their children to the hunt.
Their parents went around the back yard early
in the day, hiding brightly colored plastic eggs
filled with candy in some obvious and some
not-so-obvious places.
Naomi Orndorff, 5, ran around excitedly,
waiting for her chance to hunt for candy. “How
about, the kids hide the beer, and the grown
ups hide the eggs!” she exclaimed. This
suggestion, however, was vetoed by some of
the adults involved.
Nao.mi confided later that she was comfortable
with the Easter Beer hunt because, as she said,
"I'm allowed to drink beer.”
“Oh really?" I replied.
"Oh yes,” the five year old answered. “But only
one kind.”
“And what kind is that?”
“Root beer!" she exclaimed, grinning widely.
While the children ran about underfoot,
grabbing plastic eggs as desperately as if they
were cups of water in the Sahara, the band
played in the background.
After their exhausting egg hunt, the children
relaxed by playing in the large outdoor metal
hot tub that presides over half the backyard. All
of the kids and some of the adults splashed and
relaxed in the water, which was cool because
the heat pump was not connected:
The beer hunt, while undeniably unique, did
not lack every resemblance to a traditional
Easter gathering. Club member Eileen
O'Malley injected the spirit of the Easter bunny
into the hunt by forming little bunny ears on
the top of each bottle of Tequiza she hid.
As well, Molly Newsome [sic] hid her beers
with a special Easter surprise. When each one
was unwrapped, hidden beneath the tin foil was
a thin purple strip of paper bearing the message
“This beer comes with a Cadbury Creme Egg,
see Molly."
Not withstanding some fun candy surprises,
this Easter Beer was fairly tame, compared with
some in the past, said several members. Club
member Mike Futrell gave an example. “The
'86 Easter Beer was cool,” he said. “One of the
guys from the club had a dead VW Beetle, so we
cut it up with a blowtorch. That was the event
of the Easter Beer.”
“And I have slides!” he added.
O'Malley agreed that there were more antics in
past years. “One of the funniest things I've
ever seen at Easter Beer was about four or five
years ago," she said. “Craig Ferguson pulled up
and there was a bunch of people sitting on the
porch - he gets out of his truck and pulls out a
metal detector."
“It was just really, really funny,” O'Malley said.
“Everybody started laughing - I think he just
did it for the shock value.”
Regardless of what happens at the next Easter
Beer, you can be sure of one thing – there will
be no shortage of shock value.
