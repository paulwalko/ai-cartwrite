Walk. Either one would be a bad place to fall.
The Weeble Walk is a long canyon. It is narrow
enough to stem across at something slightly
less than full extension of the legs. It is wide
enough though that a stumble would send a
person forty feet to the floor without getting
wedged on the way down. The walls bulge
outward at a certain level providing reasonably
good footholds. The neat thing about the
Weeble Walk is that it is hundreds of feet long,
giving one ample opportunity to develop the
technique of moving fast. I bounced from one
wall to another, foot to foot, as I cruised down
the passage. All the time I was remembering
what the TV commercial for plastic dolls had
taught me so long ago. “Weebles wobble but
they DON’T fall down.”
Beyond the Weeble Walk we made our way into
a network of nice walking passages. Each one
seemed to contain some sort of gypsum
formation. There were gypsum beards, gypsum
flowers, cave cotton, and gypsum needles over
a foot long. After three days of seeing these
beautiful formations everywhere I was
becoming jaded. Sure they were neat, but
sometimes it was a pain in the ass to constantly
avoid crushing something delicate.
At last we arrived at our lead. We surveyed
some small tight passages, which led to a large
room. Here Mike wanted to start a new survey
designation. After many suggestions he used
mine which was WK. It stood for Wounded
Knee. Kelly had injured his knee the day
before, Dan had banged his on today's trek, and
Mike had been nursing one of his for over a
month now. We set WK1 on a large cairn in the
middle of the room.
We surveyed a little over 1100 feet of cave. It
was not a bad day's work, but there was a mood
of disappointment in the team. Nothing had
gone really big, and no incredible leads were
being left for the next trip. We all had been
hoping to survey the cave to its 125th mile on
this trip and we were about a thousand feet
short of that goal.
It was decided to take a slightly different route
back to camp. In a large room filled with
breakdown there was some confusion about the
way onward. Dan, Kelly, and I stayed put while
Mike and Stan scrambled around. It was here
that three days of caving seemed to suddenly
hit my body. I felt tired, and thinking about
how deep in the cave we were just made me
more tired. My eyes felt gritty and my mouth
dry despite drinking most of the water I had
carried from camp. I perked up when we got
moving again. Conversation distracted me from
my weariness and focusing on not falling
brought out my second wind. Somehow the
conversation turned to creation science. Mike
quietly defended his views and Stan got really
wound up in a good- natured way. It was after
10:00 p.m. when we got back to camp.
Everyone's energy level was up and the mood
was good. Dinner hit us hard though, and with
a long day ahead we collapsed soon afterward.
DAY FOUR
It was the day of the long trek out of the cave.
I awoke with a heavy feeling in my gut. It was
all right to be nervous, but this felt like there
was something seriously wrong with me. Then
I started thinking about how dehydrated I had
been for the last three days and realized I had
to do something. I had some private time with
one of the cave-burrito kits I had packed and
then the world seemed like a much friendlier
place.
We completed the now familiar tasks of
cooking breakfast and packing away the
sleeping bags. New desiccant went in with the
bags. The tarps were swept clean and the debris
packed away in a pack. After two days of
lightweight caving, my camp pack seemed
ridiculously heavy. We bid farewell to the camp
and set out for the surface. The first part of the
trip was not bad. The passages were large and
the caving relatively easy. As we moved closer
to the entrance, though, things seemed to get
harder. Climbs became awkward and there
seemed to be many hills to hike up.
By the time we got to the Miseries I was feeling
pretty tired. We had a bite of food and a drink
before starting in. Stan and Kelly were ahead of
me and soon disappeared into the distance.
Mike and Dan were behind me. Dan seemed to
be flagging a little. I waited and helped get his
pack through a particularly awkward spot.
After that I started to keep my own pace,
