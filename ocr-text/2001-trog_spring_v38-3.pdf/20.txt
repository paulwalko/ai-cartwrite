What Do You Know About Saltpeter?
by Chris Hibshman
What is saltpeter? Why did people go to
extreme lengths to get it? Why did saltpeter
mining result in those large mounds of dirt in
Tawney's, which are evident 140 years later? If
you are looking for answers to these questions,
you should continue reading.
My duties as Vice President of the VPI Cave
Club include leading training trips, often to
Tawney's Cave. Tawney's Cave has a rich
history, dating back to the Civil War when
saltpeter was “mined" from the cave to
manufacture gunpowder. To impress the new
and naive trainees, I would spout out
everything I new about saltpeter (two or three
facts, plus several lines of bull sh# @). After a
few minutes (okay, maybe it was less than a
minute) of preaching, it became clear to me
that I had no clue what I was talking about.
Worse was when one of the more intelligent
trainees picked up on my ignorance, usually by
asking a smart-assed question that I had
difficulty answering.
For these situations, I had two responses.
Sometimes I would bull sh# @ a reply, piling on
the guano up to my neck. Other times I would
carefully change the subject. Either way, I felt
humbled by the experience. Combine that with
being a chemical engineering graduate student
and you'll see why I decided to research the
subject and write an article so future members
will not have to endure similar humility. (It is
important to note that I rarely expressed my
ignorance about the subject.)
WHAT IS SALTPETER?
The common name “saltpeter" usually refers to
potassium nitrate (KNO3). However, it may
also include calcium, sodium, and ammonium
nitrates. The archaic spelling “saltpetre” is a
synonym for niter or nitrate. What is the
difference between the various nitrates? Many
years of field testing revealed that the
potassium saltpeter is preferred because it
produces a better explosive than the inferior
sodium and calcium nitrates. (Incidentally
nitrates are common to most commercial
fertilizers. Combined with diesel fuel, this can
also make a powerful explosive, like the 1995
Oklahoma City bombing.)
Once saltpeter is purified, it can be mixed with
charcoal and sulfur to produce gunpowder,
which is an extremely important commodity,
especially when you are trying to win a war. The
composition of gunpowder varies, depending
upon the application and manufacturer.
Gunpowder consisting of 75% saltpeter, 15%
charcoal, and 10% sulfur seems adequate to
propel most projectiles effectively. The origin
of this mixture is obscure, but the Chinese were
using it over 3000 years ago. (Another side
note: The reaction for the burning of
gunpowder is very complex and may include
dozens of simultaneous reactions. The most
probable starting mechanism is the nitrate
oxidizing the charcoal.)
There are many places where potassium nitrate
can be obtained. It can be mined in its native
state in a select few locations worldwide, but
these places are limited and the purity is not
very good. Other places include organic waste
piles and animal manure, specifically cattle,
sheep, pig, chicken, and human excrements. In
fact, in Europe during the 1500's, it was not
uncommon for people accumulate their
excrement (and the excrement of their
livestock) into a large pile, allow it to sit
unabated for at least a year, and then extract the
saltpeter. Another common place to find
potassium nitrate is in the soil of caves,
including those of southwest Virginia.
BALTPETER CAVES
The soil in caves was the source heavily
exploited during the Civil War, and also during
the Revolutionary War. An article by David
Hubbard in the 1995 NSS Convention
Handbook lists 88 saltpeter caves in Virginia,
including several local to the Blacksburg area
(see Table 1).
Physical evidence of saltpeter mining in these
caves is limited to etchings of names in the cave
walls, old timbers or vats, and mounds of dirt
