some still remain on the trail they crush
underfoot like a thin layer of crisp snow. In

At a little after three in the afternoon we
stopped and dropped our camp packs. We split
into two teams and surveyed for a few hours
before continuing to camp. I was impressed as
my team found some clusters of gypsum
needles. The longest was about twelve inches in
length. Later, Mike called Dan and I to a low
spot in a jumble of passages. There we saw a
pile of gypsum filaments that blew my mind. It
was a combination of cave cotton and gypsum
beards that was at least four feet across at the
base. The middle part of it connected to the
ceiling about sixteen inches above. All of it was
snow white and looked like the angel hair that
one can buy at the store at Christmas-time. Dan
and I circled the display with our disposable
cameras knowing they would not do the scene
justice. Mike told us that it was the largest pile
of dense cave cotton he had seen in Jewel.
By the time we stopped surveying, the two
teams had a combined total of 1500 feet for the
day. We picked up the packs and continued the
journey to camp. Much of the remaining route
was pleasant, particularly the Volksmarch. Here
the ceiling averages a comfortable ten feet in
height and there is no breakdown to hop over.

up to our temporary home. As promised, camp
was a big piece of breakdown. Sediments would
have been softer, but Mike had decided that a
camp placed on rock would impact the cave
less. Tarps stretched over the block, which was
flat but tilted. In one little area a shelf of rock
supported three small alcohol stoves. A
laminated sign above the stoves read, “Home
Sweet Home.” Stan and I made a trip up to the
water collector. When we returned everyone
was happy to hear that all of the five-gallon
jugs at the collector were filled. There have
been grim nights in camp when some failure of
the collection system has forced the campers to
reduce their water intake. We all picked out our
sleeping spots and stripped off our grimy,
sweaty clothes before stepping onto the tarps.
The sleeping bags had been waiting for us in
camp. Each one was loosely packed in two
garbage bags. Desiccant packed with them
helped to keep the mildew away. The silk
sleeping bag liners we brought with us keep the
bags as clean as possible so they can remain in
camp for years to come. In a very short time
water was boiling on the stoves and we were
chowing down our freeze-dried dinners. It had
been a long day and we all crashed out quickly
after dinner.
DAY TWO
The watch alarms started beeping at 7:00 a.m. I
had been tossing and turning for the last hour
after the cold finally sank into my bones. We
ate breakfast in the sleeping bags before
packing them away. Then it was time to
assemble the survey gear and put on our still-
wet caving clothes. Everyone was comparing
volume of urine output. No waste can be left in
the cave and urine is the heaviest waste to pack
out. Psychological factors aside, packing out
urine weight is what limits the camp trips to
four days. Even if one can limit production to
a liter per day, the camp pack is noticeably
heavier on the trip out of the cave. None of us
were on track to exceed our carrying capacity
this morning. I was tempted to chug down a
liter of water because I was already feeling
dehydrated. Instead I limited myself to some
carefully measured sips.
