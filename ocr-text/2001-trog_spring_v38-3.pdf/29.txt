rope without being mauled.
"You go up and call someone for help. I'll stay
here and watch the dog,” Matt offered
heroically.
“No way. I'm not leaving you here alone with
this thing."
“But someone should keep an eye on it so we
can find it again.”
"Forget it. You're coming with me!"
I believe I detected a hint of relief in Matt's
ce as he agreed. I hopped onto the rope and
frogged up faster than I'd ever frogged in a
rope-running competition. The second I was at
the top, before I'd even removed my gear from
the rope, I called “Off rope!” Matt's ascent was
equally speedy.
Once out of the cave, Matt and I found the
landowner's son mowing the lawn. We told him
about the dog in the cave, and he assured us
their dog was safely in the house. We asked a
few neighbors, but none of them had a dog
missing. As we started back to the car, one of
them offered, “Hey, I think I've seen some
missing dog fliers around town. They've been
there for maybe a week.”
Matt and I changed
out of our caving gear,
piled into the car, and
headed towards the
Burger King/little
store to make some
calls. We located
Chris Rourke and told
him to bring some
gear and meet us at
BK. He grumbled, but
agreed.
While we waited (and
waited, and waited....)
for Chris, I went into
the little shop and
bought a can of easy-
open Alpo. Hmm, if I
were a hungry dog
stranded in a cave, would I prefer beef or
chicken livers? Matt and I waited for a long
time, but eventually a surly Chris rolled into the
parking lot.
On the way back to the cave, we stopped at a
light pole bearing a lost dog sign. Two black
female cocker spaniels were missing. Could our
cave dog be one of the spaniels?
At the cave, we geared up again and the three
of us rappelled in. The dog was nowhere to be
found. We walked around a bit calling, “Sally!
Sofie! Whichever one you are, where are you?”
Then Chris spied the dog in question. One red
eye glowed back at him.
She kept her distance from us, barking and
backing away when we approached her. She was
obviously scared, and perhaps a bit crazed from
her ordeal. Finally, the scent of yummy Alpo
drew her in close enough for Chris to nab her.
He tied a webbing leash to her collar. Captured,
the dog tried to escape. Chris let the dog run
around a bit, hoping she would calm down.
Matt and I had started back towards the rope to
get ready for the haul when we heard Chris say,
"Hey, what do we have here?" He'd found the
second dog.
The other, smaller dog was lying on the ground,
barely moving. She didn't seem to have any
energy left. But when Chris knelt down to her,
she licked his hand and then sprang to life.
Suddenly she was full
of enthusiasm, and
her doggie friend
seemed much less
nervous once the
smaller one so easily
accepted us.
We leashed the second
dog and walked them
to the rope. Matt went
up to lower us some
gear and to set up a
haul system. I sat
down and placed a
blanket on my lap, and
both dogs piled on
me. They settled in
and showed no signs
of ever letting me
stand up.
Matt and Chris worked out the system. Chris
cut holes into the sides of Matt's big plastic
gear box and attached some webbing into a
EU
