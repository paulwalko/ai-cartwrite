from the leaching process. More subtle
evidence is the old sediment marks on walls,
mattock marks, torch marks, and soot marks.
Most of the physical evidence that these caves
were once saltpeter caves has since deteriorated
or been destroyed, but an oral and sometimes
written history remains.
A recent visit to Tawney's Cave revealed
several pieces of evidence about the saltpeter
mining. In the Saltpeter Room (this proved to
be a good starting point) you should notice
several large mounds of dirt, which was the soil
after the saltpeter had been extracted. Old
sediment marks are found along most of the
walls in this room. Further down the passage
near the stream are dozens of names etched
into the wall. Several of these date back to the
Civil War and are still present. Here are a few
to look for:
“John W. Surface – Feb9th 1862"
“W.L. Surfice - 4 Febuary [sic] 1862”
“Wm.L. Surfice - Fabuary [sic] 7th 1861 -
Bought this cave in the year 1860”.
(And now it is time for a lesson in chemical
engineering... so pay attention!)
THE LEACHING PROCE88
During the Civil War, Major George W. Rains
was assigned by the Confederacy to oversee the
production of saltpeter. In 1861, he wrote an
article on the subject and distributed pamphlets
called “Note on Making Saltpetre from the
Earth of the Caves," which is where most of
this information is obtained. Now Major Rains
is somewhat of a newfound hero of mine,
because he was a great chemical engineer. The
best part is that he probably had no idea what a
chemical engineer was at the time. He
optimized the process and even included an
economic analysis of how much money a team
of three people could make in a week.
Cave dirt contains large amounts of potassium
nitrate, along with calcium and sodium nitrates
and many other impurities. Fortunately,
potassium nitrate is very soluble in water,
whereas most of the impurities are not. This is
the basis for extracting or leaching the saltpeter
from the soil.
