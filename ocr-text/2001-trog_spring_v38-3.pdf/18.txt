Chasing Sandy
by Chip Mullins
Every spring, young cavers or just those trying
to relive their youth come together at the
WVACS field station outside of Lewisburg,
West Virginia. Here grottos such as WVU, VPI,
and some as far away as Pennsylvania arrive to
share stories of caving and create new ones.
This tradition of gathering atop a hill in West
Virginia was started a few years ago by a VPI
caver, Sandy Knapp. The location is prime for
caying with so many caves located within a
short distance, and the lack of neighbors leaves
the nightlife only to the extent of ones
imagination. Yet the real reason people come is
to cave in places that they might not usually go
and see the beautiful caves located in the region.
This year the VPI grotto decided to cave all
together (with the exception of Chris Garguilo
who is never able to cave at these events). The
cave was decided upon by the leader - none
other than Sandy Knapp. There was some
discussion about how to enter the cave, as
Organ Cave has multiple entrances. We ruled
out entering at the commercial entrance and
scaring the tourist since one must inform the
owners ahead of time. Also, there was a rodeo
going on at the commercial entrance that would
have offered some amusement but in the end
been a distraction and hassle. Finally the Lipps
entrance was decided upon and the caravan
departed. One stop was made upon this trip to
gather the needed supplies of junk food and
soft drinks. Yet for some the trip to the cave
was not entirely fun as the twisty turning road
can turn ones hung over stomach upside down
and empty breakfast quite quickly. In no time
we were parked along the road and preparing to
enter the cave.
The group trotted slowly across the field
crossing the gates and playing with the electric
fence surrounding the cave. Only cavers would
find it amusing to grab an electric fence and see
how long they can hold on. Everyone made his
or her way down into the sinkhole and the trip
began. Our fearless leader pushed forth as the
trainees lagged behind trying to negotiate the
passage that was quite wet at times. After
fighting to reach what we thought was the
passage we hoped to reach, we found that as
often happens in caving we took a wrong turn.
As the rest of the group turned around and
rested, some of us went to look for where we
had gone wrong. Somehow I was talked into
going ahead with Sandy. I chased behind as this
woman moved rapidly through the passage. As
Kirk Digby said, she was so graceful that she
didn't make a sound as she swiftly maneuvered
through the passage as I stomped noisily
behind. Then we began a long low crawl where
I came out to find her waiting for me as I sat in
a pool of sweat - only.to find that we had
looped back to where we began and the group
was beginning to pass on its way back to the
wrong turn. Eventually everyone made it back
and we discovered that the right we made
should have been a left. Now the trip was
actually about to begin (or is where it should
have begun).
Some people were already half spent, but we
agreed to tread forth. Over and under low
ceilings we pushed on. Crawling on our bellies
and then only to be able to have enough room
to be on our hands and knees, the group began
to grow even more tired. The allure of prized
cave passage was drawing us further and deeper
into the cave. Yet still the surroundings just
became more of a maze and resembled every
other cave I have seen. A few members of the
group began to question if it was really worth
the effort to continue as they tired more. It was
near unanimous among those tiring that they
would turn back. Each person on the returning
group pulled together to find their way through
the maze of passage and eventually reach the
surface.
The dim light of the now setting sun pulled us
closer and then bathed us in its warmth. We
walked from the sinkhole across the field as
each of the cavers relieved themselves in the
manner that best suited their ailment, while
some of us just laughed and made comments as
cavers do in such situations. We returned to the
WVACS field station to relax, eat some grub,
