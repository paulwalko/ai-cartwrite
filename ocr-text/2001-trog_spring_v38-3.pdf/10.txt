A Beautiful Holiday Tradition: Easter Beer
by Rachel Clarke
Eggs. Candy. Bunnies. These are some of the
items we usually associate with Easter. But for
one group of friends at Virginia Tech, the
thought of Easter is tied to another word –
beer.
Every year, the VPI Cave Club celebrates the
holiday with its official Easter Beer party the
day before Easter Sunday. This year, about 50
people gathered in Montgomery County,
Virginia to celebrate the occasion.
"You don't have to stop being a kid when
there's no Easter bunny,” explained A.C.
(anonymous caver), a club member. “You can
still celebrate, in different ways. Think of what
adults like - they like beer. So instead of
hunting for candy, we hunt for beer.”
Easter Beer began slowly, around noon on
Saturday. People slowly trickled in, carrying
twelve- or six-packs wrapped in tin foil. The
point of the foil is to hide the brand of beer.
The idea is simple – if you can see what kind it
is, everyone will skip the cheap beer, and only
hunt for the expensive kind.
On such a warm, sunny afternoon, the hiders
had the time to contemplate where to
secrete each beer, slowly wandering
around the large yard, waiting for the
perfect opportunity to put each one
away with no one looking.
These hiders stealthy wove around the
bonfire that burned sporadically inside a
small ring of stones reserved for the
purpose. At times there was no flame to
be seen, only a small amount of smoke,
while occasionally the fire would flare to
several feet. In the heat of the day, the
fire was mostly ignored, but around five
o'clock the temperature began to cool
and people started to huddle near the
fire, soaking in its warmth.
Two Virginia Tech students, Eric
Stanley and Brian Ekey, forded the wide,
shallow creek bubbling throughout the back
yard. “Oh God, it's cold!” yelled Stanley as his
bare feet hit the chilly water. Despite the cold,
the two managed to successfully cross the
stream, strewing several beers among the rocks
scattered in the middle.
When each person was done camouflaging his
or her foil-wrapped beer, he or she got to begin
the hunt. The task sounds so easy... just look
around and find some beers, right? But the club
makes it a little more difficult than that. After
each person finds a beer, they must finish it
before they begin the next hunt. This rule
makes Easter beer hunting much more difficult
than Easter egg hunting, because by the time
someone starts looking for their fourth or fifth
beer, they have had enough to drink to make
the task pretty daunting.
The club members could overcome this
hardship by resting for some time between each
venture. They relaxed in the lounge chairs that
were scattered around the backyard, filling
them most of the day. The chairs faced the
makeshift stage so that those sitting could
enjoy the music while sipping their beer.
At the side of the yard was the stage, with a
