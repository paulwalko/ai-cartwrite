Andy initially faced some stiff competition
from Philip Balister, who gave a moving
speech (something about funneling club
money into the Elvis Grotto.). Andy's speech,
however, was so eloquent as to turn the tide in
his favor. He said simply, “Please don't let me
lose to Philip."
The club acquired one new member this
semester. Chip Mullins was voted in mere days
ago. Rumors abound that he was only voted in
to keep Samantha Lambert hanging around
the club.
I SMELL BACON....
Hams of the club have converted another two
suckers into the ham radio lifestyle. Scott
Rapier and Karen Everhardt are the club's
most recent hams. Despite their new interest,
they insist that they won't become obsessive
geeks like Philip Balister. (They'd have a long
way to go to catch up.) Since getting his ham
license Mark Eisenbies claims he's not going to
be a geek about it, but you can catch him on the
radio any random time of the day.
SAVĖ Us
The number of EMTs in the club is increasing
(good, because this group needs saving). Alison
Williams and Matt Burnett wrap up their
training this week. Alison has been running
calls with the Rescue Squad, while Matt prefers
to “save his strength" for when he's needed
underground.

married earlier that week. They pointed to the
toilet paper strewn pickup as evidence. Kathy
claims, “We'd been thinking about it for a long
time. Then we just got up one morning and
decided it was a good day to get married.”
This picnic had what seemed like a much larger
crew of dogs running around. (Guard your dog
from Rascal Pirie.) The only thing more
noticeable was the number of kids! Hugh Beard
and Karen Little brought Keelie to meet the
others. Also in attendance: “Little Elvis"
Elizabeth Ferguson, Megan Bruce, T.J. and
Naomi Orndorff with friend Senna, Sylvia and
Maria Conner.
As usual, the multiflora rose bushes didn't
stand a chance. Various pickups, jeeps, and
cruisers were on hand to prevent them from
overtaking the field.
WEDDING BELLS WILL RING
Bob and Kathy aren't the only ones willing to
take the plunge. This summer will bring
together in Kristin Posson and her fiancee Dan,
Dave Colatosti and Patricia Feely, and Carl
Bern and Amy Johnson. So how many baby
showers will we be planning next April?
New OFFICERS AND STUFF
The club voted in the new officers at the end of
the semester. Mike Cole is President, Spotty D.
Rapier remains Treasurer (will he beat LePera's
tenure record?), Kevin Rock is Vice President,
and Andy Yeagle is Secretary.
