Basically, there are four steps to “making"
saltpeter from cave dirt. The first is to leach the
KNO3 out of the soil and into water. Since all
nitrates are very soluble in water, this is quite
simple. Potassium nitrate is not the only
substance dissolved in the water. Hydrogen
nitrate and hydrogen nitrite is also present. To
increase the amount of KNO3 in solution,
potash lye (potassium hydroxide, KOH) is
added to the react with the hydrogen nitrate
and hydrogen nitrite to produce KNO3. The
third step is boiling the saturated KNO3
solution to evaporate excess water and produce
a supersaturated solution. Finally, cooling the
supersaturated solution results in nearly pure
KNO3 crystals. (Solubility of KNO3 in 100g
H2O: 2469 at 100°C; 32g at 20°C). These four
steps are analogous to making rock candy from
dirty granulated sugar.
The following is a simple description of how
the leaching process may be set up at a local
cave. To start out, four large barrels with at
least one head (end cap) are needed. Drill a
half-inch hole in head of each barrel and plug it
up with a cork. Set the barrels on some timbers,
with access to the plugged hole at the bottom.
Place some twigs and sticks in the bottom of
the barrel and cover with about 6 inches of
straw. Fill the barrel to the top with cave dirt
and then add as much water as possible. The
twigs and straw act as a filter to allow the water
to drain from the barrel without clogging the
hole. The potassium nitrate will dissolve in the
water, while most of the impurities stay in the
soil.
After a day, the first barrel is drained and that
water is placed into the top of the second
barrel. More water is added to the first barrel.
The next day, this process is repeated. Major
Rains recommended that each barrel has three
washings, and then the old soil is replaced with
fresh soil. The saltpeter-rich water is placed
into a fourth barrel. Some strong lye made from
wood ashes is added to react with the hydrogen
nitrate and hydrogen nitrite to form potassium
nitrate.
The water is boiled in a kettle to evaporate the
water and increase the concentration of the
solution. When “a drop taken up by the end of
a stick becomes hard or solid when let fall upon
cold metal or upon a plate," the liquor is
poured into a trough to cool. Nearly pure ( 45%
impurities) potassium nitrate crystals will form
and should be dried in the sun.
If done properly, twelve barrels of cave dirt will
produce about 100 pounds of saltpeter on
average. Of course, this depends on how much
saltpeter is in the cave dirt. Three men can
easily process twelve barrels of soil in six days
using the process illustrated in Figure 1. În
1861, the Confederacy was paying 35 cents per
pound of saltpeter. This would result in $35 per
week for three men, which was a respectable
income. By 1864, the price increased to $1.50
per pound, or $150 per week for three men.
The quality of gunpowder depends upon the
purity of saltpeter, so it was refined even
further at a plant in Nashville, Tennessee,
before being sent to the soldiers on the front
lines. This consisted of additional filtering and
recrystallization processes, similar to those
described above.
