Attack of the One-eyed Cave Monster
by Eileen O'Malley
It was a dark and stormy night... okay, so it was
actually a beautiful, warm, sunny day. But it
could've been dark and stormy because we were
in a cave and wouldn't know otherwise.
Anyway, on this summer day of 2000 I'd talked
Matt Burnett into showing me around Giant
Caverns since I'd never been there. It's not a
large cave, so there would be plenty of daylight
left to enjoy after the trip.
We arrived at the cave through the usual route:
get to Narrows (pronounced Nars) and then
drive around picking arbitrary turns until you
wind up on the right road. I tried to remember
the street names of the most direct route, but
it's like caving - you go down enough wrong
passages that soon they look familiar and
you're certain that's the way.
At the landowner's house we parked the car and
knocked on the door a few times. A cat eyed us
from inside a window, and we heard a dog
barking incessantly, but neither of them
opened the door for us. Nor did any humans.
Since landowner permission is not explicitly
required at this cave, we geared up and headed
through the weeds to the entrance.
The fence had been cut and pulled back - not
very useful in keeping anyone out. We passed
easily through the opening. Then we rigged the
entrance and dropped into the cave.
The entrance "pit” is mostly a slope, but it's
steep enough to warrant rigging at the top.
About fifteen feet down, the slope becomes
more steep. You pass through a corkscrewy
hole, and a few feet after that you drop straight
down 10-15 feet into the cave.
Matt and I strolled through the cave (yes,
strolled since it's basically two huge rooms) and
poked through all the things one could poke
through. We inspected the rotting remains of
the old commercial entrance steps, and Matt
pointed out the mud choke which used to be
the main entrance. Apparently they even used
to have dances and parties in the cave.
However, many years ago the entrance had
collapsed and sealed itself shut, thus ending the
commercial venture.
After a couple of hours of exploration, Matt
and I decided we'd seen the cave and wanted to
head back to the land of sunshine. On the way
to the rope I heard a jingling sound. I glanced
down to see if I had any loose gear - nope.
More jingling. Maybe Matt's gear was making
the noise.
“Hey, Matt. Is that you making that noise?”
"What noise?"
So I stopped him, and we stood quietly for a
moment. More jingling. Suddenly we realized
we weren't alone in the cave. We could
practically here the ominous horror-movie
soundtrack as the fear crept up our spines.
Then we saw the dark shape about fifteen feet
ahead of us.... between us and the rope. The
shape was moving low to the ground and
appeared four-legged. I grabbed Matt for
protection (yeah, I know, but nobody else was
there to hide behind). The shape kept its
distance, which was just fine by us.
Our initial horror-movie panic gave way to the
realization that the animal was most likely a
pet, since the jingling sounded like a collar. The
shape was too big for a cat, so it must be a dog.
Did the dog fall in the way we'd come?
Then we noticed that when Matt shone his light
around, one red eye reflected back at us. Only
one. “I guess it's a one-eyed dog,” I ventured.
Matt blurted, “Oh, God. Maybe his other eye
got poked out when he fell in!” Instantly we
both had the mental image of a dog with one
eye hanging bloody and grotesque from its
socket and a dirty stick protruding. Thanks,
Matt.
We moved hesitantly towards the rope and the
dog moved as well, keeping a wide berth. We
still couldn't get a good look at it, but it moved
without any evidence of broken limbs. By this
time we realized we'd have to catch it and haul
it from the cave. Was it dangerous? Would it
attack us? Was it some nasty, vicious breed? We
were both very nervous, but we made it to the
