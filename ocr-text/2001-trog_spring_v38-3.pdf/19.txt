shower, and enjoy beverages. Our only thought
was of the VPI cavers still in Organ on their
quest to find bigger and better passage before
they must return to make their signout time.
The beverages began to take effect and our
thoughts of seeing more of the cave faded away
as the night went on. The remainder of the
group arrived with stories of grand formations
and huge passage, but only after losing their
way yet another time. These stories soon faded
away as songs around the fire embraced us all.
More memories of YTR will come and go, but
only one will stand in my mind forever. As
Mike Cole so eloquently put it, “DON'T SPILL
THE WINE!”
