face as she told us that losing the dogs after
losing the house was just devastating. As we
turned to leave, the teary woman gave me a
fierce hug and thanked us again profusely.
Despite their urging, we left without the
reward. However we did give them one of the
club rescue cards, in case other pets go missing
and they suspect the cave. We assured them our
club has rescued many animals and would be
glad to help out if we could.
Rescuing those dogs was quite a moving
experience for me, Matt, and Chris. Giant
Caverns isn't visited very often by VPI or local
cavers. The next cavers to go there would've
probably come across two dead dogs. The dogs
survived as long as they had because there's
water in the cave, but they had gone a long time
without food.
Matt and I were silent and contemplative on the
ride home, until he finally spoke up. “I can't
believe I was scared of a cocker spaniel.”
