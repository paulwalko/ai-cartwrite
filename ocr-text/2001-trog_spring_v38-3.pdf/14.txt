Grotto Grapevine

Two of them even participated in the open mic
with acoustic guitar and singing. Despite
rumors that they think VPI cavers are arrogant
assholes, the JMU cavers seemed to enjoy their
weekend. John Deighan ran a vertical session
and led a trip on Saturday afternoon, and more
JMU folks went caving with VPI on Sunday.
Some even participated in the Easter Beer hunt;
next year we'll see if they've adopted the
tradition.
From
CLUB ADDITIONS
Maria Grace Conner arrived on the scene in late
February to the tune of 7 lbs, 13 oz, and 19.5
inches long. She had a rough first few weeks,
but is eating much better and putting on
weight. Now Anne Marie and Steve have their
hands full with the baby and a very active
Sylvia!
Birch Ambrose recently celebrated his first
birthday with a small party at the Bat Ranch. He
is now almost as tall as Molly and has more
energy to boot! Birch has been very dutiful in
his attendance of club parties, and he especially
likes the laser light show set up by his dad.
BANQUET
This year's Banquet brought many cavers out of
the woodwork to listen to Wil “The Bastard”
Orndorff discuss his Skydusky Hollow project.
The frantic ridge walking, surveying, and dye
tracing began in an effort to help the local
residents fight the proposed AEP power line.
Though Wil's information didn't stop the
approval of the route, it has opened the door to
many new surveying adventures.
For his efforts, Wil was awarded the A.I.
Cartwright award, the club's most honored
recognition. The rest of the slackers received
guano clusters and jokes at their expense.
EASTER BEER
This year's Easter Beer festivities at the Bat
Ranch included some fine musical
entertainment. Las Cucarachas de la Muerte
opened the show for a set and then turned the
stage into an open mic event. A very ragtag
band made up of Wil and Zenah Orndorff,
John McKenna, and Travis Coad performed
under the name Sweaty Sphincter Sweat.
(Sounds like something SCOTS wishes they
had thought of first.) Dave Colatosti took over
from them and did a one-man show until he
was overtaken by the Sweats for a jam.
The celebration coincided with the JMU cavers'
Spring Fling, which added a new assortment of
characters, including Carl Droms, to the scene.

Amanda Stiles made a guest appearance at the
party. She's still job and/or school hunting
from her parents' home in NOVA. Says
Amanda, “I keep trying to get as far away from
cavers as possible, and then I end up coming
back!”
PICNIC
This year saw the demise and subsequent toss
of seven kegs! The great weather on Saturday
was a contributing factor.
Strangely, some people took the sunny weather
as a sign to go underground. Newberry's was a
popular trip cave, and a few folks made it into
Buddy Penley's. There was a surprising
addition to the caving crew this year - see
Katherine Ferguson's article for details.
Bob Simonds and Kathy Lamb casually
mentioned to the group that thev'd just been
