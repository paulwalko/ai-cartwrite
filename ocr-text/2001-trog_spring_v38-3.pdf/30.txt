spider system. This attached to a beiner on
the haul line. Then he cut a hole in the
bottom of the box. Each dog wore a
webbing leash which we knotted beneath
the hole so they couldn't jump out.
We placed a dog in the box and set up the
haul. I frogged up the rope next to the gear
box, guiding it as Matt hauled from above.
The dog was understandably nervous and
tried to jump from the box, but the knot
held and I was able to calm her down with
petting and soothing words.
Chris then ascended with the second dog.
His dog was a bit livelier, and he had quite
a time keeping it inside the box. I assisted
Matt at the top, and Chris and the dog
finally joined us at the top.
Once both people and dogs were off rope, I
tied the dogs to the fence while Matt and Chris
derigged. The dogs were jumping and running
and desperate to take off. By the time we'd
reached the cars, darkness had fallen. We piled
gear into Chris' vehicle and muddy dogs into
mine, and set off to find the closest pole with
the lost dogs sign.

removed the sign from the pole. No address,
but there was a phone number. Chris produced
his cell phone and Matt placed the call.
“Are you the ones who lost two dogs? We
found them. We'll bring them by if you give me
directions to your house.” Matt gave her the
street we were on.
On the other end of the phone, a woman asked,
“Are you the two cars stopped in the middle of
the road pointing right at my house?” Matt
glanced up and saw a house set back into the
trees straight ahead.
We drove to the house and I opened the back
door of the car. The dogs ran out before we
could even grab the leashes, right into the arms
of two women on the porch. A very big dog
bounded from the house to the join the
greeting.
As we talked with the women, one the mother-
in-law of the other, their story unfolded.
According the them, the dogs had been missing
for four weeks! By this time the family had just
about given up hope of finding them. The dog
we first encountered was older and had a
cataract on one eye. That explained the creepy
one-eyed glow.
The dogs belonged to the daughter-in-law. She
and her husband had moved in with his mother
when their own house burned down a few
months previously. Tears streamed down her

Just a ways down the road we spied one of the
