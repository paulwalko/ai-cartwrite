To the Edge and Back: A Four Day Camp Trip in Jewel Cave
by Carl Bern
DAY ONE
It was bitterly cold outside as Mike Wiles
parked his car in the main lot of Jewel Cave
National Monument. I had been hoping for one
of those brilliantly clear winter days that are the
norm in the western U.S., but instead it was
gray. Ah well, I thought, it will just make seeing
the sun that much sweeter when we come out
of the cave. We grabbed our duffel bags and
headed into the visitor center. Mike is the Cave
Specialist at Jewel and has worked there for 22
years. He led the way through the visitor center
at high speed even though none of the lights on
the main level were turned on. Down in the
basement we found three other cavers. Dan
Austin, Stan Allison, and Kelly Mathis were
dressing and readying their packs. Each of
them looked thin and strong. These guys were
not just cavers, they were Jewel cavers. Dozens,
and in Mike's case hundreds, of trips into this
immense cave had allowed them to tune their
equipment and caving style for the maximum
efficiency Jewel required. By comparison, my
three previous trips in the cave seemed thin
preparation for the rigors of a camp trip. When
we compared pack weight I discovered that my
camp pack weighed a bit more than everyone
else's did. It was too late for me to try trimming
weight, though; Mike was calling the elevator. I
shouldered my pack. It was time to go in the
caye.
The first camp trip was not undertaken in Jewel
Cave until 1997. Mike is very serious about
minimizing impacts on Jewel, and camping is
always a significant impact on any cave. By
1997, however, the edge of exploration was
quite remote from the elevator. The
productivity of survey trips was becoming
limited by the amount of time a team could
k before having to start the journey out of
the cave. Safety was also becoming an issue as
even the strongest of explorers ran the risk of
an accident brought on by fatigue. An
underground camp was the solution to these
problems. After significant reconnaissance,
planning, and experimentation, a permanent
camp was established in the cave. Mike deemed
it successful when the first trip to use this camp
brought back 10,000 feet of survey.
Our trip started off slowly. Everyone had to get
used to moving through the cave with the extra
weight of a camp pack. Less than an hour of
caving brought us to the area where the real
work began, The Miseries. A great number of
crawls and tight spots had already been mapped
when the Miseries were discovered, so the
name was not given lightly. They are a 1,100
foot section of crawlways on the trade route to
the southeastern part of Jewel Cave. The
Miseries are followed immediately by the 700
foot long Mini-Miseries. These are so named
not for being shorter but because the ceiling
drops even lower. Many people are not
particularly impressed by the Miseries when
they first pass through them. It is on the trip
out, after hours of more caving, that they work
their terrible magic. Our group was not overly
concerned by the Miseries on this first day. We
knew that we had three days to go before seeing
them again.
Beyond the Miseries, Jewel opened up.
Metrecal Cavern and The Mind Blower led us
onward. There was an awkward constriction at
The Stopper and then things got big again at
the down-climb known as The Point of No
Return. We stopped at the water cache near
Sidetrack Tap and picked up another liter
apiece. Then we hiked through the truly
enormous Cloud Nine, a room that would seem
more at home in Mexico or attached to
Mammoth Cave. Eventually we came to the
Two-Step and the Three-Step. Here, individual
footprints rather than a trail led across a floor
thick with gypsum formations. The low ceiling
forced us to pass the camp packs carefully over
this gypsum. The next enormous room we
reached was Seventh Heaven. Beyond Seventh
Heaven was the Land of Milk and Honey, the
destination of my longest trip prior to this one.
This is one of my favorite areas in Jewel. White
calcite rafts the size of my palm and thinner
than Pringles potato chips cover the floor. A
