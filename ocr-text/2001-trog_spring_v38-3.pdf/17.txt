Elvis Grotto. Ban on Caving Discontinued: Co-chairs Underground at Picnic
by Katherine Ferguson
BLAND CO. - The caving world was shocked
Saturday when two high-ranking members of
the acclaimed Elvis Grotto. arrived at Picnic
muddy and tired. Co-chairmen Jeff Jablonski
and Paul Hess admitted to vertical caving.
The pair had descended into Newberry's and
rappelled Triple Wells. They did a few laps
around one section before making a critical left
turn. The ascent to exit the cave was done on a
reported thirteen year-old frog system.
This, in light of recent Elvis Grotto. activity as
VPI Cave Club Officers and Committee Chairs,
is clearly disturbing.
Kristen Posson, who did not attend Picnic, was
obviously concerned. After viewing pictures of
her beloved Elvis Grotto. co-chairs in muddy
cave clothes, she remarked sadly, “I certainly
hope that was just for the EG pin-up calendar,
and not because [they] actually went caving.
You know, caving is dangerous."
Respectable Elvis Grotto. co-chairs Ko
Takamizawa and Craig Ferguson tried earnestly
to maintain appearances by drinking beer and
hanging out.
Philip Balister, Ed Fortney, and Scott Rapier
also Darticipated in the Elvis Grotto.-approved,
aboveground activities of biking, hiking, and
bush pulling.
Mark Eisenbies, VPI Safety Committee Chair
and long-time Elvis Grotto. co-chair, did not
seem concerned about this episode. When
asked to comment on this surprising event, he
simply replied, “Whatever. Are you coming to
the race on Sunday?"
Picnic has had a negative impact on Elvis
Grotto. before. In 1999, Elvis Grotto. member
and longtime trainee Eileen O'Malley broke
down under pressure and obtained her VPI
Membership. She was voted in at Picnic.
Hess stated, “The face of Elvis Grotto. is
constantly evolving.” Does this mean that Elvis
Grotto. will be unable to maintain their non-
caving agenda? We will have to wait and see.
