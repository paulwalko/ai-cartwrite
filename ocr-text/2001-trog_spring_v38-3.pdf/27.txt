we could through that. She got her butt wet but
she was drier than if we made her do it herself.
After we climbed down the breakdown (well,
some lazy people crawled but I won't mention
her name) we ran back into John and the rest of
the group. It turns out they were pretty much
the cavalry since everyone else was gone for the
weekend. It was all good though – they were
rested up and warm and they were great moral
support. At that point we lumbered out of the
cave and we only missed our signout by
something like 90 minutes. Damn 8-hour
trainee trips.
Overall I was pleased with how the whole
situation went. Every person on the trip acted
extremely well under the circumstances and I
thought they acted appropriately. On the
surface John made sure the basics of a chain of
command was being set up and people were
being called out. Each person in the cave
looked out for Cathy but also was very aware of
their own status and never let themselves get
too tired, cold, hungry, or thirsty. Cathy did an
excellent job and she helped out a tremendous
amount.
There were a few things that could have made
the whole experience better. First and most
importantly Cathy could not have gotten hurt.
Damn trainees. That would have made the trip
a whole lot better. We wouldn't have had to
carry a single person out then. I wouldn't have
to sit down and write this article, either. Damn
trainees. The only other thing I thought could
have gone better was the treatment of her
ankle. There was not much in the way of
splinting material available so we kept it as
immobile as possible. Second was that I should
have made more of an effort to cool her ankle
and elevate it. This would have gone a long way
to reducing the swelling. Other than those two
things I believe all went as well as could be
expected with the equipment at hand.
This accident is best chalked up to the “shit
happens” theory. Cathy hadn't done anything
stupid or dangerous, she just landed badly. This
could've happened to anyone on this or any
other trip. In fact, I'm planning to do some
research to prove it. I'll take all the trainees on
another Smokehole trip and send them down
the slide one at a time until enough of them get
hurt to prove the point. Details will be
published later.
After we left the cave, Cathy went to have her
ankle checked out and found out it was
sprained. She was in this funky-looking plastic
cast for a bit and then upon being freed she
went and broke some other part of her leg. I
had nothing to do with that! Oh yeah, and this
article had nothing to do with terror but I
needed a title.
