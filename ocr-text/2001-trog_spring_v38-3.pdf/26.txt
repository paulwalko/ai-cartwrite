Terror at -24 Feet
by Matt Burnett
weekend of OTR and most cavers were out of
town.
Elliot, Nik, Scott (?) and I stayed to start Cathy
moving towards the entrance. Initially we tried
a few feeble attempts at wrapping the ankle, but
that quickly ended in disaster. I had some over-
the-counter pain medication in my pack that I
thought would spoil otherwise, so I gave a pill
to Cathy and we started the brute-force method
of carrying her out. Let me tell you, V-shaped
rooms suck when you have to carry a person.
SHE GOT HER BUTT WET
BUT SHE WAS DRIER
THAN IF WE MADE HER
DO IT HERSELF.
It was a bright and warm September day -
perfect caving weather. Actually, I don't know
what it was like outside but the cave was a nice
cool 54° with just the right amount of humidity
- perfect cave weather. It was near the
beginning of the Fall 2000 semester when John
Deighan and I decided to take Valerio Viti,
Scott Edmond, Cathy Cogswell, Cory Brozina,
Nikolas Asaro, Elliot “I-need-an-easier-to-
spell-last-name” Darchicourt and Rob
McClinton to Smokehole. This was a first cave
trip for some of the trainees while others like,
oh say, Cathy had been a few times before.
The trip in was pretty uneventful - lots of
looking at the formations and explaining
various aspects of caves and caving. Everyone
seemed to be having a good time. Some of the
trainees were picking up on basic skills very
fast which was quite good to see. We had
reached the Big Room in a decent time and, as
trips often do, we took a long break at that
point.
After everyone had enough of resting and
looking around the room, some people set out
to turn one of the “hills” in the big room into
a mudslide (start ominous music now). Most
people on the trip took part in the mudslide
except for me - I tend to follow the laws of .
physics and my body was at rest damn it. Right
about the time we were going to leave, Cathy
took one last slide down the slope and just
started rolling around at the bottom grabbing
her ankle in obvious pain. Of course this meant
I had to move. Damn trainees.
No one had heard a snap and her ankle did not
look to have any obvious signs of injury, but
when you compared it to the other ankle it was
obvious that it was starting to swell. At that
point we gave Cathy the option of trying to get
out with help or to be carried out. She chose to
try and get out with some help.
John took four of the trainees with him to get
some more experienced cavers underground to
swap out with the trainees. Unfortunately this
would be quite the task since it was the
We eventually decided that the best method for
transporting her was to have a person on both
sides of her supporting her and two people on
either side to provide support and balance to
those doing the carrying.
It was slow moving across the Big Room, but
about the time the floor started evening out the
pain medication started to kick in and Cathy
suggested we let her crawl on her hands and
knees for a while. Apparently the pain
medication had dulled the pain enough that she
could stand minor movement in her ankle.
Woohoo! That rocked! We let her crawl
everywhere she felt comfortable crawling and
we would carry her over some of the rougher
obstacles like streams and cobbled floors. This
was a significant improvement on time.
The trip to the entrance was rather
unremarkable at that point. The only major
obstacle left was the roughly 15-foot section
where you generally have to squat down and
wade through the water. I didn't think Cathy
was moving enough to keep herself warm if she
got that wet so Elliot and I carried her the best
