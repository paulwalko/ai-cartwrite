thinking that I would just wait for them when
things got big again. On I crawled, shoving my
beastly pack ahead of me. I was in the zone,
pain and weariness safely tucked away in the
back of my mind. Suddenly I noticed that the
floor beneath my face did not look heavily
traveled. My pack obscured the view ahead and
the ceiling was low enough that I could not
quite turn my head. Hmmm, I seem to be off
trail; maybe this will connect back to the trail,
though. I shoved the pack ahead and crawled
along further. The pack wedged. I peered
around it and see that the passage had ended.
Crap. I managed to turn around and get the
pack ahead of me again. Oh well, I will just
backtrack until I meet up with Dan and Mike. They
will set me right. Wait a minute, though. I am in a side
passage. They could pass my wrong turn before I get
back! I could be lost in this part of the cave
where there is hardly a place to sit up straight!
Crap! I hustled back the way I came, shoving
the huge pack ahead of me so fast that my arms
begin to ache. I see lights! "Hey Carl, you went
the wrong way,‚Äù said Mike.
After that incident I stayed close to Mike and
Dan. Dan seemed to becoming down with a
cold and it was debilitating him fast. The rest of
the trip out was slow. At last we arrived in the
Target Room, near the elevators. In addition to
our stash of Gatorade there was a damp poster
and some envelopes waiting for us. Each
envelope had one of our names written on the
outside; Stan and Kelly had already picked up
theirs. The cards and poster were to
congratulate us on the 125th mile. We had not
accomplished that, but we had passed the 200-
kilometer mark. That was cause for celebration
and the poster acknowledged that milestone,
too. We wearily made our way to the elevators.
That night the four of us went out for pizza and
beer. The next morning I set out for Denver
before dawn. From behind the steering wheel
of my car I watched the sun rise over the snow-
swept Wyoming landscape. It was a very sweet
sight indeed.
