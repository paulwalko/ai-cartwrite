TRAVELIN
Steve Wells and Joe Thompson are still running
around chasing jobs as overpriced janitors at
nuclear power plants. The money may be good,
but Wells claims the “sitting around all day!
lifestyle isn't so great for his figure. So much
for that construction worker bod!
Pam Mohr just returned from a month-long
trip through Portugal. She plans to spend a
mere two weeks at home before spending two
months driving across country. Her extensive
traveling isn't bizarre - it's her willingness to
spend two months stuck in a car with Kirk
Digby that has everyone baffled.
Steve, Anti-Steve, and Joe Thompson head to
California this summer to rappel and climb El
Capitan (a mere 3000 feet). The jury is still out
on whether Wells can convince his evil half to
climb it on knots with him. (His initial
comment? “Yeah, right.”)
Paris was the destination in January of the
Winter Weekend Abroad crew consisting of
Jerry and Joan Redder, Joan Johnson and Ko
Takamizawa, and a few other folks who this
author has failed to recall. That's okay, because
thanks to the great wine there's probably a lot
that they themselves don't recall about the trip!
The vacation was fast and furious, but the
group did manage to sneak some museum
culture in around the wine and cheese fetes.
ROPE RUNNING (OR WALKING, FOR SOME)
Don't forget to come out to the Yellow House
on Wednesday evenings this summer for rope
running. It's a great chance for new folks to set
up their gear, test out other gear, and chase the
Orndorff girls around the yard.
