Incident at DMC
by Bill Balfour (as posted to a listserv)
Wells and LePera (Da Steve's) went into DMC
on Friday evening [March 24, 2000] to push the
top of Mega Dome. About 100 feet up the
infeeder going to Mega Dome, Wells slipped
and fell backwards a few feet into a crevice
dislocating his shoulder. LePera spent several
hours trying to get Wells bandaged up so that
he could make it out on his own but Wells was
in too much pain.
At 5:00 a.m. Saturday morning Lepera headed
for the entrance and arrived at my house at
approximately 8:00. We called Steve Smith for
some medical advice then we called Eric
Stanley and Chris Rourke, two EMT's in the
tech cave club and got them on the way. We
also called Ben Schwartz to come. We wanted a
fast team to get in and assess the situation
before having to alert any full scale call out.
At 10:00 a.m. Ben and Eric entered the cave
taking food and drugs. At 10:45 LePera, Chris,
Matt Burnett and Alison Williams headed in.
Ben and Eric got to Wells just before noon and
administered some drugs and were successful
in getting the shoulder back into the socket; it
basically went back into place on its own after
they got his shazaam suit off. Wells was then
ready to boogie and they started out, meeting
the other crew close to the bottom of the
Weathermaker. In the meantime, several other
folks had shown up including Steve Smith, Wil
“the Bastard” Orndorff, Phil Benchoff, Philip
Balister, Eileen O'Malley, and Sandy Knapp.
Ben got out first at 5:00 and told us that
everything was ok and that Wells was coming
out on his on power. Wells exited at about 6:00
and the last person out was about 7:00. There
was plenty of beer to go around at that point!
Several of the folks including the Steve's went
on down to the Knipling cabin to partake in the
Dudefest activities and were fed and roasted at
the same time. Wells has a new nickname
“Shoulder” for his troubles.
A big thanks to everyone for the quick
response and getting the job done without any
fuss 'or muss. Everything went very smoothly.
Thanks also to Gary and the rest of the
Knipling family for their hospitality and
understanding. And thank you Steve for not
hurting yourself any worse than you did; you're
not a wuss in my book no matter what LePera
says.
