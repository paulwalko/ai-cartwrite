by tnis time the drops were riced so mortimer, Igor, Tadeusz,
and myself got into a sedan chair designed for the climb ahead. The
bearers grabbed the handles and hauled us up the hill. At the lip
of the drop the rope test team rappeled (abseiled) down the pit.
Unce down, the five cavers pulled the rope to test it (see Figure 3).
Satisfied that it would hold, they signaled to wortimer that all
was ready. Snapping his thumb into place, ski started into the
misty chasm. I asked Igor if the thumb gets hot and ne explained
that the blood circulates and dissipates the heat. The only danger,
he explained while offering me some kielbasa, was to ris backwards.
