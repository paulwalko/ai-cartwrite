SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1922
I'm mad as Hell
and I'm not going to take it anymore!
It is time for a rather poignant editor's column concerning the recent devel-
opment with the Don Davison STC/Don Martin NSS News/lan Ellis Supekack events. I
do not know how much anyone at there knows about it, but I have heard enough items
to upset me (and I have not been able to find anything to refute my feelings. As
I see it, the major problem lies not in who is right or wrong about the value of
a chunk of steel and aluminum called the SupeRack, but about the moral attitude
taken by some high-standing and important members of the N.S.S. I feel that Don
Davison is being screwed by several people in the NSS. Whether Don is right or
wrong is irrelevant. What matters is that he is not getting a fair chance and it
cauld happen to anyone of us at anytime.
The whole matter started when Davison did an evaluation of the SupeRack (I
have reprinted the original article here). wyle Isenhart brought the article
before Don martin (NSS News Editor) in the Feb. 14 letter where he states that the
vertical section should get to edit the article because of a motion they passed for
themselves. wyle was allowed to edit the article and Davison tried to add more
confirming data to the report (this data included but toned down in the May NSS
News). Well, there were still problems. First Larson then Martin complained about
the SupeRack article by Davison. Finally, both Ian Ellis and Kyle Isenhart were
allowed to rebut the Davison article. And there you have the may News.
Davison got the poor end of the stick because he never did get to show his
real opinions. Don Martin claims in his April 29 letter (reprinted in part here).
that he believes in presenting a fair and concise account. But Davison's article
was edited twice before publishing while ullis and Isenhart were included intact.
As an editor myself, I do not consider this to be good editorial practice. I will
admit I may be biased, but I will publish any cogent matter that I am sent that can
point out the other side of the story.
Even more important than the Davison case in specific is the general concepts
of policy that Davison's case has brought out. First, the Vertical Section claims
a right to edit all material dealing with vertical techniques, etc. This is an
outrageous attitude leading towards total bureaucratic control. Larson makes the.
statement that ads placed in the News in good faith cannot be criticised in his
March 31 letter (reprinted here). Martin, on April 11 makes a similar remark that
only proof (underlined in such a manner that it would have to be very convincing)
of falsehood will enable an advertisOnet to be criticised. This means that an
item that claims you can stake your life on it can not be criticised until a life
is lost on it. This is a sad state when people are censored for trying to help
others. And there are so many other, comparitively simpler, problems, Martin will
accept Davison's instances of injury with facts and names when Davison from the
very outset of the STC's research program has stated that unanimity will be main-
tained to protect people. Martin also, after recieving a letter of protest, wrote
that he would edit out part of that protesting letter to the editor in order to
save the writers embarrassment. A letter to the editor is judged such because it
is to the editor and not edited by the editor! Une final point, von martin is not
only NSS News editor, but also on the Board of Governors. This is a classic case
of conflict of interest. It would not be allowed in american government. It goes
against the system of checks and balances that keeps american democracy as func-
tional as it is. It should not be tolerated. I admit that I am Vice-president
as well as editor for my grotto, but I will gladly step down from either position
if my fellow members want me to. Personally, I think Martin should relinquish one
of his positions for the reason that he carries too much power and could be caught
in a conflict of interests which could not result in the best interest of the NSS.
I am sorry that such a situation as this one has had to develop. As long as
it has, though, I think we ought to be able to see all sides of the real issue and
to decide on our own what should be done. I hope that we can all make the decision
that is best for each of us. By my above article you can tell that I have made
my decision,
