SPRING
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1977
Charlie Larson to James Dawson, March 31, 1977
"Criticisms of advertisements placed in good faith and considered acceptable
for one of the Society's publications (in this case the News), by any other NSS
committee would, if published, constitute an intolerable conflict between two
NSS committees, not to mention a complete betrayal of the advertiser and the
policy under which the advertisement was accepted. The S&T article submitted for
the March News (and the only one I've seen) included an evaluation of the adver-
tisements for the Super Rack.
Don Martin to James Dawson, April 7, 1977
"After due consideration and following a lengthy phone conversation with
President Charlie Larson, I have decided to exercise my prerogative as editor and
make the changes indicated on the Xeroxed portions of the STC report concerning
the SupeRack which will appear in the May issue."
Don Martin to Don Davison, April 11, 1977
"Incidentally, I will not print any articles detrimental to any paid adver-
tising unless the writer proves that the ad is totally or partially misleading
in its claims--and that there is a definite chance of danger by persons using
the technique(s) or products advertised. In the case of the Superack, I now con-
sider the issue closed except for any "letters" which might come in. I intend to
route the letters to either yourself or to Kyle as the case may be for answering.
out, if you have just one instance of a caver injured because of the improper
functioning of the Superack, please document it with facts and names and it will
be printed as a service to the membership."
Don Martin to Don Anderson, April 29, 1977
"...I am a firm believer that an editor's main job is to present a fair and
concise accounting of any controversial material to be printed for the entire
membership....I do resent the remarks stating that Ian cllis used his economic
influence to sway my decision... In any case, if your letter is printed, that
section will be deleted--more to save your signers from possible embarrassment
than to indicate my guilt or lack of it concerning the issue at hand."
