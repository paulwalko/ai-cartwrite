SupeRack, et. al.
WARNING -- Superack
over the years, vertical cavers have developed mechanical rappel devices which
enable more of the friction, necessary to control the sliding rope, to be produced
in the rappel device, and require less of the friction to be produced against the
body. The standard rappel rack currently allows almost all of the control friction
to be produced in the rack itself, with control being maintained by sliding the
bars and varying the number of brake bars in contact with the rope, The Superack,
as currently supplied by the speleoshoppe, is not an improvement on the standard
rack. This new product does not provide variable control on fast ropes; in these
situations the Superack becomes a constant friction device, requiring significant
and continious body friction to maintain control. An example of the lack of fric-
tion and control follows.
January, 1977
"We riked the pit with slightly used mountain-lay Goldline and I started slow-
ly down the 160 foot drop using the Superack. About 150 off the floor, I attempt-
ed to stop using the braking force of the rack alone (a typical and easily accom-
plished task, when a standard rappel rack is used). only sliding the bars on the
superack upwards with ALL the strength in my left arm achieved this result, About
100 feet off the floor, stopping the slow rappel using the SupeRack alone required
the strength of both arms to jam the bars upward. The bars moved easily and
jammed completely, but only great force produced sufficient friction. About 50
feet from the floor, control was lost when my braking hand couldn't be moved
rapidly enough to assist the left hand in jamming the superack brake bars. The
safety rappel cam was activated."
The male narrator, a strong and experienced vertical caver, weighs 185 pounds.
Less frictional control would have emerged from the SupeRack if blue water III
had been used, how might this affect a 250 pound caver carrying extra gear? Cavers
weighing over 300 pounds use the standard rack effectively. With these heavy
weights, jamming the bars 18 especially important. Yet, when a strong 185 pound
caver jammed the bars on the SupeRack in order to stop a slow rappel, sufficient
friction was produced only with an extraordinary amount of force - that supplied
by two arms - even with 100 feet of rope hanging below him.
It is strongly recommended that cavers NOT abandon the standard rack for the
more expensive, and less controllable superack. The claims and comparisons of the
of the advertisements and introductory article are incomplete and misleading. The
SupeRack does run cooler than the standard rack, but at a tremendous sacrifice in
friction and control, two important safety factors in rappelling.

Kyle Isenhart to Charlie Larson, February 14, 1977:
"...in 1976 the Vertical section at its meeting passed by wide majorities
several motions, one of them stated that "All articles pertaining to vertical
techniques or equipment to be published in the 'N.S.S. News' or 'Bulletin should
first be reviewed by the board of the Vertical Section of the N.S.S. for accuracy."
Don martin to Don Davison, barch 15, 1977
"after due consideration of all sides concerned regarding the Superack mat-
erial--both yours and Kyle'g--and after deliberations by the NSS Executive Comm-
ittee, President Charlie Larson is seriously considering appointing an ad-hoc
committee to look into the whole situation before going into print. I have con-
curred with this decision."
