1977
Polish Caving Techniques
in february a crack team of polisn cavers undertook an unprec-
edented challenge; to earn the vertical wight patch in one dayTo
iiormal cavers this seems an impossible feat, but to tne intrepia
cavers from the Polish People's Republic Such tasks are chila's play.
t considered myself quite forunate to have the opportunity to accom-
pany the team as it went for proke, wortimer ori, the leader of the
solish People's Republic Caving Contingent (Perico) confided to me
before the trip "Yes, my friend; it is for to laugh...only eight
vertical shafts. why, in my country it is not unusual for me to
aoseil (rappel) into a dozen vertical shafts in a day." Ã¼nly later
did I learn that wortimer is a chimney-sweep. The country is full
of smoke stacks which do not conduct smoke through the top, but
rather have a hole at round level so that the smoke can be used
in the smoked-fish industry, leaving the chimney unused and ideal
for rappeling (abseilins). No wonder Poland produces so many
vertical cavers. I would like to point out that the trick is not
to rappel (abseil, all the way to the bottom of the chimney.
we quickly reached our destination in Alabama, while the
transport teams were searing up, Igor, one of the main assault
sroup, was demonstrating the renowned Polish ihumb Rappel (abseil)
Iwee figure i). AS Igor explained, break bars wear out, but not
the thumo. After a month the thump hardens ana can be used again
and again. I was especially interested in the carabiners Igor
showed me. the sates on the mark I opened outward at the end,
tne iark dat featured a side gate which swuns both in and out. It
was easier to deris, dzor explained. (ree figure 21.
