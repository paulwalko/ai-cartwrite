THE T'puri TRUCLUDYT
-1977
BANQUET
On February 19th the VPI Grotto held its annual banquet.
The speaker R.E. Whittemore was excellent what with his nar-
rative and slide presentation. The awards committee was headed
by Lor Windle and assisted by Jackie Redder who replaced the
wounded Mike Wolf (more about that later). Pat Louden won the
Sex award for her work with cupid. She was awarded a leash to
take care of the animals she dates. Jim venton was given the
Heartthrob award for continued efforts (sort of a booby prize).
de recieved a do-it-yourself sex kit, Denton was also a co-
recipient with Jim Hixson and Linda for the mange award. They
were each given a bar of soap to take care of themselves. Lynn
wright earned the Flame uut award for her state of mind at al-
most every party. She was given a box of personalized barf
bags (half-gallon size). Tuna Johnson earned the Armchair
Caver for his lack of speleoing. He was given a seat cushion
made from Mike Wolf's shredded coveralls (that's pretty low).
Tuna also recieved a set of earplugs for the I-Don't Want-to-
Hear-It award for his martyrdom as club advisor. Doug Thompson
won a foot-high rubber duckie (but never collected it) for sinking
his Toyota in the Potomac River at Old Timer's. Alan Armstrong
won the wreckless wriver Award for having his Renault in the shop
for half a year. He won a French translation book with all the
necessary terms he would need. Mike wolf won the brain Bucket
for his dedication. The night before Banquet we had no people
worthy of the brainbucket. Mike Wolf, made a kamikaze assault
on an ice patch and busted out his front teeth. Guano Clusters
were given to bill stringfellow for his work behind the bar and
at picnic, Ed Loud for his driving force with the miller Con-
test, and Buddy Denley for being a great land owner. Ed Rich-
ardson was going to have been given the PW (Pussy-whipped )
award, but it was given later when Ed was removed from office.
He was upset.
Banquet party was another wonderful success as usual. By
an amazing act of the great cave god, Chernobog, the Banquet
was prophetic. Jim Denton, winner of the heartthrob, found a
sweet young girl named Carol-inn for his heart to throb about.
Lor Windle will surely be remembered for his plee at the end
of the awards ceremony. He said "If you don't like these awards,
then go earn some yourself. Get wildly drunk tonight and win
yourself the flame-out; or leave the party and wreck your car
and get the Reckless Driver award, Now go out and win it!!"
The next morning lor totalled his subaru in a barrel-roll just
outside of Blacksburg, Mike Wolf sustained some injuries. The
police were impressed with wolf holding the brainbucket and
grinning his toothless grin while a foot-high rubber duckie
quacked in the back of the car. But all's well that end's well.
