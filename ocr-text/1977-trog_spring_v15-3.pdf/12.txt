Drinking,
Techniques
To make a finger bowline
belay, start with a piece
of avalanche cord or sim-
ilar substance. Make a
bowline by following the
diagrams #1 through 4.
de sure to snug down the
knot and m lt the cord
end to prevent untying.
Next, poke a hole near
the top of your cup. Pass
the standing-line end of
the cord through the hole.
Tie an overhand knot in
the end and snug it down
as shown in diagrams #5
through 7. Be sure that
the hole in the cup is
not so large as to allow
excessive spillage from
the hole it. elf. If the
hole is small, the cord
itself will virtually
plug up the hole. Besides,
you won't be drinking from
that point on the cup.
During the testing, the
DTC came to the conclusion
that the bowline must be
of a sufficiently large
enough size to slip off
of the finger without too
much problem. Otherwise,
the cup is too difficult
to disengage during such
events as dancing or go-
ing to the bathroom,

SPECIAL REPORT. DRINKING ACCIDENT AT SPRING VAR !!
It has become readily
apparent that in extended
party situations even the
most ardent of partiers
will face the brink of ex-
haustion. At this point,
even the greatest die-
hard may lose his grip and
drop his cup. It was with
this problem in mind that
the DTC developed the fin-
ger bowline belay. (See
diagram above) This has
been extensively tested by
members of the DTC in many
party situations and proven
to be effective in limiting
spillage.
in essence, the bowline
is attached to the finger
in such a manner that if
the cup slips out of the
hand it won't fall beyond
the length of the tether.
There will be a minimal
spillage due to the jolt
and the cup finding its
i own center of gravity...
On April 2, 1977 the
Virginia Region of the
National Speleological So-
ciety experienced one of
the most massive drinking
and partying accidents ev-
er witnessed. By extreme
good fortune, members of
the DTC were present at
the attempted rescue and
survivors have been inter-
viewed to determine the
cause of this massive dev-
astating catastrophe.
The weekend of April 2-3
was bright and brisk down
in Abingdon, Virginia where
the Virginia Region was
holding its annual Spring
meeting. on Saturday, the
2nd, a party was to follow
the meeting and dinner.
The party started badly
when it was found that the
party conditions were im-
properly rigged, fortun-
ately, members from VPI
had brought their own gear
and the audio was re-rigged,
Everything was fine until
11:00 PM, when a member
of RASS cut the music to
announce the presentation
of a movie, "Castleguard",
in another room. The party
quickly returned to normal,
but was interupted at mid-
night to show the film once
again, this time in the
only party room! There
were no alternatives. The
film was shown (50 minutes
of good caving, but not
real action). By the time
the film was over, the
party was dead. There were
