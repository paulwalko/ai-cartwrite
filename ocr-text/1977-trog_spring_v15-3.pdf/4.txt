The club has made great progress in the past year with
renewed emphasis on mapping and cave exploration. We are ex-
pectins several new members to come in soon and are hoping
for another rood crop of trainees this fall. The miller
Contest produced its usual revenues this past fall and is
expected to do so again this Springs
So, things are going fairly well, but there is still
room for improvement. We need to re-evaluate our trainee
program to see if we can reach a larger percentage of the
caving public. It is obvious from the vandalized condition
of many caves that a large portion of the caving population
is not aware or does not practice proper cave conservation.
By expanding the awareness in both conservation and safety
we can benefit caving and cavers by helping to preserve the
caving environment and by reducing the possibility of ac-
cidents which would not occur if proper techniques were
used.
I feel we should make a strong effort to educate per-
sons who are unaware of safety and conservation techniques.
i would like to see the entire club make a group effort,
not just a few members, to introduce new persons to the club
and to inform these people of cave conservation and safety
so we can have sood caving in the future.
urink beer, Kaise nell, it's great!
best of Caving,
