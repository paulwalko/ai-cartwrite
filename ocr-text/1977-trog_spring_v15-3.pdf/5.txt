nere's what they said about the last TROG:
"VPi's mind is in the proveroial gutter again. Aside
from a declaration of war (in the suise of partying) on the
Doc. Grotto... tney manage to make themselves look siliy.
rino else would brag about drowning Toyotas? Also in this
issue is a funny parody of the safety and Techniques üomm-
ittee column in the NN News.".

"Witty humor, satirical spoofs, songs are intwined around
serious articles.. on caving. Their 'Drinking Problems wolved'.
spoofs the NSS New's S&T column. # song commemerates the great
Thorn Creek Campground flood this past year. For those of you
who have never tried a rappel spool, here's the plans for
making one and how it works."

"whitt and I laughed, rolled on the floor, cackled for
hours over your issue. Very fine Job, In a rare state after-
wards, whitt said he'd even like to camp near Vi at the next.
convention. rie was more sober next day...".

"My hard-hat is off to you. my only hope is that people
might sometimes get as sood a laugh from the Baltimore Grotto
iNews as i got last night reading the rozlodyte. "Combat" by
mike wolf had me falling off my chair. The stuff about rolling
"those lousy Divers into the gutter' was the best part. I had
hardly recovered from that article when I turned the page and
saw 'Pukes and Near Pisses'. I died. Although I hardly know
any of you Valers, I think it might be safe to say that any
grotto who prints such nas ty things about the WTC (uave von-
ison?) and the D.C. Grotto has got to be all riäht! If you
continue publishing newsletters of the same caliber as this
one, you will make me very happy. Then possible, cvelyn
Bradshaw will be too busy setting on your case to bother with
me. Keep up the rood work. it sure is nice picking up a
newsletter and not having to see the same old bullshit!
