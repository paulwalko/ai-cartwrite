Doubles, he went on was simply using two fingers instead of the
thumb. Already Ski was prussiking back up the rope, I noted that
he was using the goose-step system. Apparently the German occupation
of Poland was not totally wasted on the Poles.
And so it went, cave after cave. All eight pits, and it was
only possible through teamwork, pre-rigging teams, rope testers,
derigging teams, and those stalwart sedan bearers. I was a little
disappointed because I could not witness the famous Polish Rodeo
Rig (See figure 4). I asked Ski for a demonstration and he agreed.
Selecting a suitable rigging point, ski poised himself on the lip
of a 100 foot pit, carefully coiled his lasso-rope, and took a few
wind up swings with the loop. Taking careful aim, he tossed the loop
toward the rig point, a 2 inch thick stalagmite 8 inches long, and
leaped into the pit at the same time. To my amazement, the lasso
found its mark and the stalagmite held. Stanislas, another member
of the contingent, shook his head and let me in on the fact that in
his province it was customary to leap before throwing the lasso.
On the way back to base camp we compared caving techniques and
equipment. The most interesting innovation was the solar-powered
caving lamp that the PPRCC is currently testing. This could be the
wave of the future as carbide supplies dwindle and energy conserva-
tion becomes more pervasive in the caving, community.
I would like to conclude this tale by expressing my admiration
of the PPRCC. They are nothing if not resourceful, competitive,
and innovative. Vertical techniques flourish among the polacks of
the Polish People's Republic but not anong polacks in the United
States due to the preponderance of basement apartments. It seems
that polish cavers from the People's Republic and their emigres are
truly poles apart.
