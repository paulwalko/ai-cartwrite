SPRING
THE TECH TRUULULITE

wwe...wonder...mazement..du!! None of these words can
really explain it. There are no words that can really be an
adequate definition of that which is indescribable. Truly
there can be no other word for it than just saying
The Grotto Grapevine
The grotto has been quiet this year. The general con-
sensus agrees that VPI Grotto is waiting, like a coiled snake,
to spring at any moment. Indeed, though comparitively low
key, we are still very active,
As has become traditional, I shall relate the amourous
adventures of our grotto first. Past president Mike wolf fell
before the awesome aura of (w) Pam toiles, the only highlight
being the grand party siven by the Peterson's that weekend. Fast
troublemaker won vavison also yielded to a greater power and
wedded Cheryl jones. Dennis Vaders has advanced his rendezvous
with romance and will wed this June, Skip Whitehurst will get
the law laid down to him in August as he marries Francis.
in the realm of the not-specifically-permanent type of ro-
mantic activity there is much to discuss (but most of it is
still rumor and we will let sleeping dogs lie-so to speak).
All i can say is that there are several recognized encounters.
Pat Louden snagged Chuck Shorten's affection late last year.
jim venton has also made a move (wee following Banyuet article).
Iuna Johnson, as always, is still looking. Wous l'hompson has
found something. vonnie Carter has found nothing. cd vevine
is not looking.
in the world of important cavins there is much to say.
Wie held our election for officers in April and came up with:
A president named Carter (uonald u.), a re-elected V.. named
vivindle (or modo a treasurer who rings like a pell (uavid), and
a secretary called sica (Phil). The latter is member 196 and
there are three or four other trainees setting ready to claim
their number at the time of this writing. With land owner re-
lations in mind, VPI Grotto voted to buy a metal sate for Buddy
Penley and then convinced the Virginia Resion to match funds
for a second gate. cxcellent team work! mapping projects
continue in several caves across the state (the state of South-
West Virginia that is).
of miscellaneous note; frame and Suzanne have returned to
Alaska. Ed Richardson and Nancy will move up this Summer, Jim
Bearden, Lor Windle and a mess of other people have rented a .
house in Christiansburg for next year's parties. It will pro-
bably be called The 600 (for it surely will be).
