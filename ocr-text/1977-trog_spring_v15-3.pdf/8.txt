THE NIGHT THEY DROVE THE REGION DOWN
ZZZZ
sung to the tune of
"the night they drove old dixie down"
(for explanation see the w.l.C.)
Joe Waver is my name and I urove to Voimento,
till those from www came (we nopeu they woulan't drive this far),
at tne party on saturday, we were thirsty and ready to play,
I took the peer and drank it like nell,
it was a time I remember not so well.
The night tney drove the resion down,
and all the beer was pouring,
the night they drove the region down,
And all the people were soaring,
I'hey went ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha,
ha-na-ha ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
sack with my friends from tennessee and in comes the enemy,
"Cavers, listen to me, here's a film that you have to see,"
Now I aon't mind them showing the flick, ana i don't care
if i feel kinda sick,
Just show the film to those who request,
out they should never have snown it to all tne rest.
The night tney drove the region down,
INow the peer wasn't flowino,
The nignt they drove the resion down,
ause the movie they were showing,
They went na-na-na-na-na-na-na,
na-na-na na-na-na-na-na.
Like my grotto around me, I'm a partyin' man,
And like the cavers beside me, I need to arinx to stand,
well, we were rowdy, both loud and drunk, but a movie
laid us in the bunk,
į swear by my puke and the tears I weep,
You can't raise the party back up when it's fast asleep.
The night they drove the region down,
And the beer nad stopped pouring,
The night they drove the region down,
For all the people were snoring,
They went 2-2-2-2-2-2-2,
2-2-2 2-2-2-2-2.
