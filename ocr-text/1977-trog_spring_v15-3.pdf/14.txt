Troglodyte (Revisited) Song
(sung to "Troglodyte" by Don Davison)
Times change. This may be the way things are
or the way things may become if we are all
not as careful or caring as we should.

Lyin' in the gutter, lookin' back and forth,
When this thing crawls at me a smellin' like a horse.
all at once it pukes its guts, retching by the score,
must be a Troglodyte feelin' kinda poor.
un they're drunk and rowdy though sober ones are nil,
They like it fine just to lie there in the swill,
where it's dark and dirty and sticky on the floor ,
Places that make normal folk run right out the door.
Flat on his back or on his hip or rear,
Six-pack he's gurglin', that ain't half his beer.
Pony bottles full, full of what, you ask.
Beer, wine, or whisky to make the burnin' gas.
Drunk on his ass and beer mus in his hand,
Patch on his arm of the group he knows is grand,
Cooler in his car. see the booze they snarf,
And in the still of a late spring night you can always hear them barf.
some so to conventions and some to UTRS.
back and forth and back and forth just drivin' in their cars.
jammin' bottles into mouths where rolaids often 30,
Comin' out a-drinkin' beer at five degrees below.
Crawlin' and a-wallowin' in gooey muck, you know,
wonderin' if sclerosis of liver's sonna show.
fightin' off the mouching bums and punks who'd drink him clean,
It ain't no wonder he loves to set obscene,
unce an old Troglodyte, ne thought he'd take a ride.
uh well he totalled it because he did imbibe.
Now if one drinks they all head for the street,
'Cause they know that drunkin' drivin' is a rap they can beat.
Their cars are made with four wheel drive, when drunk they drive like hell,
They love to knock down tree trunks and try to hit them well,
but if you see one wheelin' by or drinkin' of the booze,
aeep your distance far away or your soul you will lose.
for many a man, Lord, a-thinkin' he was smart,
nas drifted into beer joints and heard old Troosy fart,
And then a spell took over as on the floor ne fell,
And ever, ever after his soul dwelled in drinking hell.
