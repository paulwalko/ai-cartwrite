tired bodies all over,
Virtually no one was still
in shape to continue the
party. Nearly everyone
went to crash. Those that
remained were very drunk
and unable to party or
quickly discovered that
their partner was no long-
er among those present.
By 1.30 the party had been
destroyed. A few brave
souls remained awake and
helped clean-up All was
still by 5:00 AM, Sunday
morning
ANALYSIS
This accident is an ob-
vious example of the time
lag involved in drinking
and partying. When people
drink hard, they have to
exercise to work off the
alcohol. In this situa-
tion, the alcohol was giv-
en an hour to work over
the body without any re-
juvenating effects of ex-
ercise through partying
(dancing, singing, etc.).
All of the people inter-
viewed agreed that they
were injured by the lack
of activity caused by the
showing of the film. Minds
four hours drunk cannot
fathom any movie. Bodies
fall similar prey. An
informed source told us
that the decision to show
the film at midnight was
made because the Virginia
Region, and VPI in partic-
ular, had partied enough
at their banquet, etc.
Such malice cannot be ex-
cused when it leads to an
accident like this one!
'Dear DTC'
IN. AT A PARTY I DRANK RUM
SO I WOULDN'T GET SICK, I
PUKED UN PURPOSE AND FELT
GOOD THE NEXT MORNING.
DID I DO THE RIGHT THING?
Yes. As long as you do
not plan to drink anything
more that night, puking is
an excellent way to purge
the system. Unfortunately,
many people feel really
sick after puking and can
not drink anymore so I
would reccomend puking
only at the end of a party
or if you have learned your
limitations. Everyone
should learn this technique
for extended partying sit-
uations.
as it should. The kidney
should have no problem
bringing all of the alco-
hol out of the blood
stream in that time, I
would reccommend an exten-
sive program of testing
yourself to find how much
you can drink of what how
quickly to determine what
is best suited for you.
Everyone should know their
limitations and preferences
and should try to achieve
or excell as the situation
demands. This will help
to reduce rescue needs in
party situations,
2N, IS IT SAFE TO SMOKE
DOPE AND DRINK?
Personally, I would have
to say no. In most states
you can be arrested for
dope, but you have to be
in a rare state (in public,
driving, or such) to be
arrested for consuming
alcoholic beverages. So
why take the chance?
4N; ARE THERE MANY SITUA-
TIONS WHEN A PASSED OUT
DRUNK SHOULD BE LEFT A-
LONE RATHER THAN BEING
MOVED TO A MORE COMFORT-
ABLE POSITION?
Yes. There are many
times when it will be a
wiser thing to leave well
enough alone and let a
drunk lie. There will be
many an unpleasant discov-
ery that an inebriated
sot will have a violent
reaction if moved. Many
people will tend to be-
come ill if moved while
they are feeling poorly.
So I would not reccommend
any excessive motion or
tampering lest you find
that your aid is not
totally appreciated.
5N. WHAT WOULD YOU CON-
SIDER AS ESSENTIAL PAR-
TYING EQUIPMENT FOR ANY
EXTENDED PARTY SITUATION?
In any party, there are
essentials and there are
essentials. A person
could get by with only
his beer if he can drink
it warm. But for almost
all beer drinkers any
party will require a
cooler apparatus. These
coolers can range from
a fancy camping cooler
(cost $20+) to a large
styrafoam cooler ($3+)
to a small six-pack
cooler ($2+). There are
also special coolers
designed to snugly fit
cans and bottles, but
their price is still
too exorbitant. Other
near-vital accessories
include such items as
styrafoam can and bot-
tle holders for drinking
beer or a drinking glove
if drinking cold wine
or a mixed drink from
a container. If the lat-
ter, you must have a
drinking vessel for the
liquid, Other enjoyable
but unneccessary items
include things such as
chairs, blankets, etc.
for when you get tired,
food, money, etc. for
when you get hungry; and
aspirin, Rolaids, or Alka
Seltzer for when you feel
poorly.
3N. OCCASIONALLY AFTER 4
OR 5 BEERS OVER A LONG
PERIOD (6 Hrs) I WAKE UP
WITH A HEADACHE WHICH
LASTS ALL DAY THAT IS SO
PAINFUL THAT I CAN ONLY.
ELIST LATERALLY, HOW DO
I ALLEVIATE THIS FEELING
POORLY?
It would appear that you
may have a dysfunctioning
system that does not act....
