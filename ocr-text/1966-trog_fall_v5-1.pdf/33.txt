WhelIan Auf Cave

About a week ago the three of us, Harry Travers, Troy Glaudight,
and Rhinston: Poole ( no pond intended ) were sitting down in the snack
bar looking through Caves of Virginia for a cave to explore when we came
across Whellan Auf Cave listed in the lifor the record only" section.
Although it would probably turn out to be nothing but a twenty-five foot
mud crawl, it was close to school so we decided to check it out anyway.
Stopping at a little country store to get candy, bars, we asked.
the man if he had ever heard of the cave. He said that he had and reluctantly
gave us directions to find the owner, but advised that we not go into .
the cave as it was very dangerous. He would not elaborate on this danger
so we thanked him and left for the cave.
Arriving at the owner's house, we found that he was not at home
but we got to talk to his wife, aunt, uncle, and three cousins. We im-
agined that these were the cave owner relations we had heard about at
Grotto meetings. The wife gave us permission to enter the cave but. none
of the people wanted us to go in due to ithe danger which we then found
out to be a supposed maze section which was laid out like a crossword puz-
zle with only one solution passage, '.
With some misgivings we entered the cave which we thought had
been formed in limestone although Harry took it for granite. Rhimston
thought that. We were in 'marble country, but I told him that he was
confused with some other cave system,
While exploring the cavern we found one room which was so..
full of little brown bats that we aptly named it "The Little Room".
In other sections of the cave we became covered with mud, completely .
soaked with cold water, and finding the maze section to be non-existant,
we emerged thoroughly disgusted with the whole hundred plus feet of
passage. We wish now that we had followed the owner's advice and left
Whellan Auf alone.
