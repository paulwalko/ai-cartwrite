FALL, 1966

At the end of this 500 feet, we came to a "T" intersection with
walking passage which extended to the left just. 50 feet but was a good
deal more .extensive to the right. We followed this passage, which also
has a small running stream in it, about 800 feet to a siphon pool in the
bottom of a spherical room. The siphon looks and sounds exactly like a
sink trap. There is absolutely no hope of pushing it.
No one returned to the cave until midsummer of 1966, when Whitt,
Glen Davis, and I decided to get the survey underway. We mapped all of
the section that we had explored the past fall, and then began to survey
the numerous side passages, starting on the east side of the main passage.
Our first lead was interesting in that coon tracks adorned the floor, but
it became too small for humans. The next passage was very rewarding for
it lead across seven passages, parallel to each other and to the main
passage. We left a station at every intersection and surveyed the south-
western extensions of the parallel passages, none of which went very far.
....
The next. weekend we three returned with John Peduzzi to survey the
remainder of the parallel passages, and, we hoped, the rest of the cave.
Ed Morgan and Bob Lewis were to join us later. "M" passage, the furthest
from the main one is about 300 feet long. On the eastern side there is
a ten foot pit into which a stream flows and coon tracks appear on the
silt floor. Passages !!J", "K", and "I" are not extensive.

We started into "Il passage with the hopes of finishing the parallel
passages in a couple of hours. fus we started off, Whitt was first with
the Brunton, John next with the tape, I held the red flashlight, and Glen,
bringing up the rear, took the notes. The first.400 feet is straight,
although much of it is crawling. We had gone through a tight place, which
Morgan later refrained from pushing because it "looked as if it didn't
go." Just past Gremlin Falls, we were forced to begin belly-crawling.
Often Glen was so far behind that John scratched the reading in the dirt
beside the survey station. Whitt kept saying at each station that the
passage went only ten feet more. Finally, we came to a high slot which
we chimneyed up and found ourselves in a large room. There were many
formations, the first we had seen, and water could be heard gurgling,
We found one section of the room which was decidedly warmer than that
which we had already come through, and determined that both the water and
the warm air currents were from the surface. We all huddled around this
warm blast as if it were a radiator..
ma
From this room, we followed a passage which doubled back on us. It
is a flat crawlway with a hard mud floor which gradually descends and the
passage ends with a small hole on the right side. Whitt said he couldn't
get through, but when he stuck his head through and found that he could;
we all groaned. Â· Whitt and John went through to explore beyond. This is
the one tight place in the cave. At one instance, one is pinned by the
ceiling and the floor. However, the floor is of soft dirt and a way can
be dug.
