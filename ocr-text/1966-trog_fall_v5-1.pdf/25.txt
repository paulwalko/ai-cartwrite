BUTLER CAVE
November 19, 1966
by David Yolton
Personnel: Tom Vigour, Jack O'Meara, John Atthowe, David Yolton.
We entered the cave at about 4:30 p.m. and reached Sand Canyon, the
main passageway of the cave, with little trouble. The purpose of our
trip was to carry in equipment guch as the New-V bars and "space blan-
kets" to be used the following week for the Butler mapping trip in Marl-
boro Country.
We left our equipment in the canyon and proceeded to the Penn State
Lake area where Jack O'Moara wanted to do some general reconnaissance, and
to see what the possibilities for draining the lake were. After wandering
around a few wrong passages for a while, we arrived at the lake. Jack
crawled through the water to get a better look at the situation and de-
cided that the lake couldn't be drained. This accomplished, we hoaded
back to our equipmunt in Sand Canyon, and proceeded from there toward the
top of tho Crisco Way We found it after a few hours of walking through
the water and deposited our equipment. On our way back to Sand Canyon
and the cntrance, we stopped and had a nice hot dinner in the Trunk Chan-
nel. Beforo wo reached the turnoff to the entrance, we made one last
stop to see the Moon Room which although it has been muddiod up, is still
quite an impressive sight. We got out of the cave at approximately 1:00
d.I. and woro met with the coldest night of tho season to sleep out in.

For one that docan't mind a little water, the cave is quite nice be-
cause it is possible to see a lot of main fortions of it by using almost
all walking passage. It is quite nice in some places because there is a
lot of dry sandy walking passage although it is somewhat lacking in for-
mations.

As for the past two Thanksgivings, I
again wanted to spond the broak working in
Butler. With Mike Hamilton retiring from
caving and ascending to mountaincoring in
Colorado, Butler fell into my lap. Tho
ono part of the cave that needed attention,
and had not received any sincc Thanks-
