there was some eight inch rimstone. Just beyond the Gypsum Room.
there was a three and a half foot soda straw reaching from the floor
to the ceiling. Getting a little hungry we started the long trip

still in his Jumar gear, we nominated him unanimously to go down

CASSELL FARM CAVE
November 13, 1966 by Marie-Christine Noble
Personnel: Anne and "Whitt! Whittemore, ED Morgan, Glen Davis, Carolle
Noble, and Marie-Christine Noble :
Cassell Farm Cave is actually a series of closely connected
caves in Burke's Garden, Tazewell County. The caves' entrances are
in a field honeycombed with sinkholes, Carole Noble surveyed these
entrances. She found that there are at least seven entrances: two
of which are stream fed, all the others having dry openings. These
entrances are located in a radius of several h ndred yards. ,

The portion of the cave that we surveyed is about one hundred
yards from a dirt road and over a hill. The first room is easily
accessible; it divides into three passages. The main passage enters
a roofless room with a small waterfall. This room opens directly
to the surface, however, entrance to the cave would only be possible
by a fifteen foot vertical descent..
After a walking passage and several rooms, the main course
divided into two passages. The right passage seemed to have been
explored before, the left seemed unexplored.
This virgin system is a series of about threc or four fairly
large rooms. Running along the floor of these. rooms is a foot wide
fissure, from which can be heard an underground stream...
