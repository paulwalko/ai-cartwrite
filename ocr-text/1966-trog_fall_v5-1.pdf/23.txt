THE TECH TROGLODYTE
Saturday was the trip Phil and I had looked forward to - Rocky Hollow
Â·Cave. While our car was being filled with gas, the attendant pointed out
the entrance to an unreported cave, only 150 feet from us. It was located
in the parking lot of a laundromat. Entrance was gained through a cement
and steel tunnel. Bill Biggers climbed on down, but reported it was
filled with gravel and silt,
Following Don Finley and Rick Shultetus of the University of Kentucky
We sped toward Big Stone Gap. Also on the trip were John Davis, Charlie
Maus, and John Holsinger.
Arriving far up the mountain road, at the site where we parked the
cars, Finley's first action was to remove his hubcaps. "Yes," confirmed
one of the local boys standing nearby, l'If you don't, them fellas up the
holler will steal 'em. I reckon I ought to know, I lived here all my
life." This local boy decided he would guide us the two miles up the
mountain to the cave. Delmar, a candidate for the Redskin's line, was
only in the 7th grade, but he stood six feet, one inch and weighed 240
pounds. He literally ran up the steep trail as we dragged after him,
lugging 180 feet of ladders and about 600 feet of rope. For one who has
never been to this area, they must imagine a completely different caving
area. Gone are the long valleys and gently rising ridges. Instead,
continuous river gorges, exceptionally steep and sometimes very high are
found. The entrance to Rocky Hollow Cave is at 2900 feet.
While several of us began mapping, Phil and Don checked out an en-
trance farther down the limestone bluff. However, they did not have
enough rope to reach the entrance.
Rocky Hollow is a large passaged, vertical joave in which we explored
about 3000 feet of passage. Although there are several pits over 75 feet
deep, the bottom (stream) level can be reached with a 45 foot ladder and
a 30 foot ladder. There are many short homemade wooden ladders for
shorter drops and ample quantities of logs and telephone cable - used by
the local explorers. As Holsinger said, "If those guys are wild enough
to climb 60 feet on telephone cable and logs, then they're wild enough to
steal my hubcaps." As with the other two caves we had visited this week-
end, Rocky Hollow will demand a return trip...
Sunday, after saying our goodbye's, we headed for Blacksburg and
home, stopping only briefly for a short trip through Natural Tunnel.
