THE TECH TROGLODETE
14
Deciding that there was probably too much to survey beyond the tight
place on this trip, we turned back, and on second thought, surveyed "H"?
passage. It is not as extensive as "I" and was completed at that time.
We ended our survey and returned to the surface, Meeting Ed on our way
to Mr. Banes' house, he told us that they had tried to find us, and had
checked all the parallel passages. If they had only posted a little more
in "I" passage, they would have found us. Tsk.
In the latter part of September, Morgan, George Stonikinis and I
mapped part of a small maze section on the western side of the main pas-
sage near the siphon pool. We also finished the tail ends of the paral-
lel passage survey and found a few more formations.
On the first weekend of the fall quarter, two carloads of cavers :
descended into the cave. Among the group were Tom Roehr, Bob Simonds,
and Jack O'Meara who went with Whitt to survey the portion at the end of
"'I" passage beyond the tight place. My group consisted of Bob Lewis,
Cletus Lee, Glen Davis, and Ed Morgan, We finished up the maze section
near the siphon pool and then went back to the "T" intersection.
Beyond this intersection, to the northwest is a crawlway leading to
sand-floored rooms. We mapped this, and rather than making closures that
would make us backtrack, we continued in the passage which seemed to keep
going. It did, indeed, keep going and we mapped about 700 feet of pas-
sage. This passage parallels the first 500 foot section we surveyed, and
for the most part is hands-and-knees crawling with intervals of walking.
The termination of this passage is just below the entrance pits down
which Doug climbed to lead us on our first exploration. The passage had
been somehow overlooked on earlier trips because one has to crawl almost
immediately.
Báº¡ck at the drawing board we decided that Thierry's map had consisted
of our 500 foot and 700 foot sections, and the entrance room.
Our last trip in November 1966 finished the survey. Morgan and Dave
McCloy went to the back of "I" passage to finish up Whitt's survey of the
previous trip and to check some pits through which we hoped to get into
Banes' Cave, The two pits found in this section are 125 feet and 250 feet
away from the lower level of Banes' Cave. However, mud fill discouraged
this hope. Also on this trip, Glen, Whitt and I surveyed the entrance
room and made several needed closures in the vicinity of the "I" inter-
section.
The streams in the cave are running, and do not seem to chang'e mar-
kedly with the surface changes. We wonder at the position of the siphon
pool in relation to the surface and where the water goes. We wonder if
there is a trunk channel somewhere which takes water from the other three
