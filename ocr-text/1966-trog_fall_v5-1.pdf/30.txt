skill, a back rappel. After collecting all the gear, we made our way
back to the entrance. This final stage was made by chimneying (on
belzy) up the crevice. Getting everyone out was a long, wet, cold pro-
cess. My total time in the cave was nine and one half hours, enough
to complete 20 hours with a club member on at least three trips.

BRASS KETTLE HOLE AND JOHNSON'S CAVE
by David McCloy
Fersonnel: Ed Morgan, Linda Heitz, Tom Vigour, David McCloy.
Over the first weekend of 1967, Ed decided to go on one of his
cruci-lition,? Wcolend cevi: trip. We reached our first objective;
Brass Kettle Hole, located in Tazewell County on Saturday afternoon,
and we gave the farmer who had directed us to the cave a treat by letting
him see VPI cavers in action as we body rappelled down the sloping
entrance drop. This slope was only about 60 degrees and extended down-
ward for about 70 feet, however, the mud made it hazardous without a
rope. In this cave we mapped and surveyed approximately 1300 feet and
wo enjoyod a mud fight at the end of the cave. On the way out, Vig
and Ed climbed up the entrance drop unessisted; however, Linda and I :
climbed out on belay.
The noxt morning after ... refreshing night's sleep in Ed's station
wagon--it had been raining too hard to find a place elsewhere to
sleep-~We were ready to explore the next cave on our itinerary,
Johnson's Cave in Russell County. The night before we had already
driven to within the approximate location of this cave. The Cave
hed a big, booming entrance and about 100 feet in the cave we cocked
breakfast and, later, dinner. After breakfast, while Ed and Linda
were cxplcring outside for another entrance, Vig and I went back
in the chive for 200 feet for a little look-see excursion and we were
amused to see a fox. As Vig and I went back out o: the cave we met Ed
and Lince and also the former who lived across the ronde Without
any light of his own, he gave us a guided tour of the front portion
of the cave. After he had left we got down to come serious mapping
and surveying. After squeezing through a tight eight foot crawlway,
we get into some interesting passageway. At one point the cave had
tri-level passageways. After we had mapped 1000 feet we explored
tho remaining accessible cave in the back which probablÄ±r totaled
about 500 feet. We found one or two possible leads to more crve
which could be acted upon by a later trip.
