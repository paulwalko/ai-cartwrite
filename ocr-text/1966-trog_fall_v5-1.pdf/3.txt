THE TECH TEOGLODYTE
DO
EDITOR'S COLUMN
#
Here's another issue of the Troglodyte and this is the editor's
column. Instead of wasting time telling you stuff you already know,
like we're the World's Most Active Caving Organization", that we're
doing all the work in southwestern Virginia, excluding Holsinger's
beat, that we have the greatest parties and average three trips a
weekend, I'll just kind of collect all the little bits of gossip,
scandle and news that might be of interest and put them here. Maybe
this should be called the "Filler Column", but anyhow, here it is.
The Fieldhouse New Year's party was pretty good although I
thought that were too many differently-oriented factions there, mainly
Us and the yankees. Nagy did a good job of getting everybody together
and making then sing, but. when you don't know the "Falcon", you can
only do so much. Our sincere congratulations to Hester Ailes for her
tremendous job of resurrecting the Germany Valley for cavers.
Have yi all seen Dr. Halliday's new book, Depths of the Earth?
It's fairly good, talks about a lot of the lesser known cavesand just
about anybody who is anybody has his name in it at least once. Iyle.
Conrad has a couple of good pictures of Schoolhouse in it, and there's
a good, but somewhat spectacular, chapter on the Butler-Sinking Creek
System. The Life of the Cave by Charlie Mohr "and Tom Poulton is well
worth your time and $4.50. It: contains many fine pictures, and an ex-
cellent text.
If anybody has any 'quality magazines available for the Clover
Hollow library, give them to the Equipment Chairman. Mike will see
that they get to the library. After reading the register on a recent
trip there, I think the Club should purchase a couple of Donald Duck
comic books for Massachusetts cavers to read; it seems they don't ap-
preciate our epidermal tastes. Oh yes, Bob Jullian got conned down
the "Thistle Tubell, all those tiny little helictites at the bottom,
huh, Bob?
In closing, my CONGRATULATIONS to our new officers (April 1967
to April 1968): Stoney, Ed, Mike and Bob. I think we're in for a
good year,
Tom Vigour
