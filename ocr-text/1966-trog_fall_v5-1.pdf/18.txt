Saturday at 1:00 P.M. our group left to begin our eight hour
trip. Soon we were struggling to get the car up the extremely rocky....
road to the cave when our first injury was received. Henry was
hit in the leg by a rock that the car spun out, While changing
clothes , Keener remembered that he had left his boots on campus
and had to go back to get them while the rest of us rigged the drops
to the Canyon Room.
The first hundred feet of passageway is a good workout for
any vertical caver. First of all there was a seventy foot entrance
drop followed by a high squeeze through a narrow V shaped slit
in; two rock slabs. The log which we used to stand on was broken
in two at the time, Next we had to bridge a five and a half foot
gap for a distance of about fifteen feet. Then we descended a ten
foot drop that was kind of hurtin' for handholds, After a fifteen
foot back rappel over flowstone we were at the tie in spot for the
Grand Canyon Room. The ceiling of this room was about 125 feet
above us. Below there was nothing but 100 feet of darkness. At the
bottom of the Grand Canyon Room we rested until we saw a star far
above us which turned out to be Rick Keener with his carbide lamp.
He came down by means of a carabiner. At twenty feet from the floor
the carabiner popped open and he hit the floor rather hard.
At the side of the room there was a stream which came from a
high waterfall about fifty feet upstream. With the exception of a
trip to the bottom of the Andrew's Room, ours was not a sightseeing
trip. While Wes and Keener rested, Henry and I went down the crawl
to the bottom of the two 150 foot waterfalls which form the huge
Andrew's Room. We lit a small piece of magnesium ribbon and the
sight of the waterfalls was even more impressive when Iit up. If
it can be said that getting to the bottom of this room is half the
fun; then getting out is at best the other seven eighths.
After the detour we proceeded to explore parts of the cave
which are less frequently visited. Keener wanted to see Idiot's
Delight so we allowed him 45 minutes for the round trip. At the end
of this time he had not returned but Wes generously decided to allow
