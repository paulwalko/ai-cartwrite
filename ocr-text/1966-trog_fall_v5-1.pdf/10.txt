men THE TECH TROGLODYTE
A rather expensive, but nonetheless enjoyable dinner was followed by
a somewhat disjointed speech given by an old caver and professor at VMI..
Dinner was followed by a business' meeting; among items discussed was
a Region publication. The "D.C. Speleograph" was suggested, but no posi-
tive action was taken. The Spring business meeting will be held in Har-
risonburg next March.
Dr. John Holsinger conducted the Virginia Cave Survey meeting, and
interested persons were assigned specific areas of the state to work in.
Bill Karras, formerly of the NSS, presented a very interesting film
taken during the rescue in Rowland Cave, Arkansas in 1965.
À small party was held at Roger Baroody's home after the various
sessions were over. Things quieted down somewhat after the gendarmės
arrived.
The Officers of the Virginia Region for 1967 are: Chairman - Roger
Baroody; Vice Chairman - Ed Bauer; and Secretary-Treasurer - Anne Whittem
more.
