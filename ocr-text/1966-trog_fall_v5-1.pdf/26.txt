THE TECH TROGLODYTE
way to accomplish overything was to spend an extended lcngth of time in
the cave. The notorit tyof the "Crisco Way", a 500 foot crawlway carrying
a stroam and coated with grease-like mud, plus the lure of Grecnbrier
County, made recruiting a problem. However, with a fcw letters, I had
throo 'other fools that agrocd to go. Rick Kcener and I from VPI, Bill
Royster from the Shonandoah Valley Grotto, and Richard Beck from Peters-
burg, a former VPI caver.
Our next problem was sloeping guar, slooping bags of any kind would
be impossible to drag down the "Crisco Way" and kuep dry. I became
familiar with the National Research Corporation's "Space" Blanket at
Holubar's in Boulder this summer, and they seemed our best bet, A lotter
to the company explaining our problem rosulted in six "Space" Blankets,
at no cost, in exchange for a report on their capabilitics. Nu-V Bars
supplemented with candy bars, boned chicken, fruit cocktail, and bouillon
would hopefully kecp us alive.
We entered the cave at noon, Thanksgiving Day, and wore at the
Crisco Way! in threo hours. Dry clothes are essential for an extended
trip, consequuntly, wo cerricd fairly largº packs into the cave. They
wero a rcal problem in the "Crisco Way" as they absorbid water; and mud
just loves packs. The thirty-five foot pit into Marlboro Country adds
another pack with ropo and ladder. Aside from a short bulay line and a
small water-foll, the drop was nogoti?tüd with no problcms.
Amidst such comments as "they'ro probably carving the turkey at home
now", and "what the holl am I doing hcro?", we "enjoyed" our Thanksgiving
dinnor of bonod turkey, fruit cockt-il, and a somewhat battered can of
brow that Rick had somehow haulid down the "Crisco Way".
The evening was spent getting to and looking over the Candle Room
and trying to decide what had to be surveyed and checked. After check-
ing throu question marks, wo went into a crawlway, changed into dry long-
johns and settlcd down with our "Space" Blankets.
If onough insul tion is used butwein you and the ground, and if you
wear porfüctly dry clothos (lottsa' luck), you can stay fairly comfortablo
in tho Blankets. In order to rotain body heat, the metallic liner cannot
breath, and consequently tho moisturc builds up ... and gots COLD. Two
hours of sloup at a stretch was it. I've never shivcred for five minutos
straight before. With all the probloms, though, wo did manage ten hours
of fairly sound slcop. Họt bouillon and a Nu-V Bar (BARF) lessened the
agony of wet clothes and wo woro off aain Friday. Rick and I mapped to
last big unsurveyed passego in Marlboro Country, and Richard and Bill
spent the day chocking question marks. Another cool, damp night in our
"Spaco" Blankets (livened up a littlo when I rollid over on a burning
candle) and moro hot bouillon gót us moro or luss ready for the trip out.
A losing battlo up the "Crisco Wayıl and a three hour hike to the cntrance
did us in. Fortunately, we met Jack O'Meara and Mal Hightower at the
entrance. They hclpod us out, and had a beautiful six-pack for us. After
