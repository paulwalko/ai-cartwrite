Newson found the cave after five tries. Whitt broke a trail
through the snow; Barry slid back down to the road. We surveyed
several hundred feet; Newson helped by watching and making helpful
comments. Vig set stations, Barry explored ahead, Whitt read the
Brunton, and I took notes.
After we got to the first fossil room, Barry lost interest in
surveying. We left the cave at 7:30 so Newson could make dinner
at Mrs. Smith's. He was a little late. Jewson's reall-" a good guy,
but he's hard to wake up when he's drunk a lot.

NEWBERRY'S CAVE
January 14, 1967
by Danny 0. Wright
My most interesting vertical caving trip while a trainee was to
Newberry's Cave. The trip leader was Tom Roehr, Treasurer of the
VPI Grotto. Other members on the trip included Jim Cooper, Cletus
Lee, Bob. Simonds, Bob Amundson, Gary Moss, and Nancy DeJarnette.
It had snowed hard about a week prior to our trip and the melt-
ing of this show had made the entrance drop to the cave dripping wet.
The entrance was a 50 foot deep crevice. A short distance from the
entrance we encountered a 12 foot drop with a breakover. Before
making this small drop, we rigged a cable ladder and belay line for
the return trip. The next drop was what we had all been waiting for,
the 180 foot drop. Bob Simonds and Cletus were the first to rappel
down because they wanted to get hero shots of the rest of us with
their cameras. To our surprise, they found the rappel was extremely
slow with the double brake bar rigs we had all planned on using.
Therefore, Jim Cooper decided to make his drop on a single brako bar.
I guess that most of us thought that Coop had the sense of a Mongol-
ian Idiot, but it turned out that he had the only decent rapnel of
our group.
After about an hour of exploring, we started the climb out.
The ascent up the 180 was made on a passage called the Devil's Stair-
case. It wasn't exactly a good place to go for a Sunday stroll.
The Staircase oponer up some 40 or 50 feet above where we had rigged
the 180 foct drop. I now got the chance to learn another new caving
