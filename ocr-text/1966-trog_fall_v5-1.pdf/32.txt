SLUSSER'S CHAPEL CAVE January 21, 1967
by Bob Amundson
Personnel: Whitt and Anne Whittemore, Cletus Lee, Gary Moss, Bob Amundson
SIusser's Chapel Cave is located about five miles northeast of
Blacksburg. The entrance narrows down quickly to a small crawlway.
The crawlway continues on for a hundred feet or so and drops into a
channel about ten feet high and six feet wide. Chert was rather abundant
in this passage along with many formations ( mostly stalagmites ) growing
on each side. There were also many pools of which many were several
feet deep and wide enough to make a good splash. We followed this passage
for quite a ways until we came to the place where Whitt had stopped on
his last mapping trip in Slusser's Chapel. ..
We preoceeded to mapi Anne set stations, Whitt read the Brunton,
Cletus took notesand Gary and I looked on ahead. Shortly the passage
had a branch off to the right which we mapped. Gary and I continued
on for about five hundred feet and reached a Y junction. We took the
left branch and followed another 200 feet to a point where the passage
ends. In this section of the cave there was much large breakdown,
On the left near the top of the dead-end passage I noticed a
place between a large breakdown rock and the ceiling large enough for
me to crawl through. After crawling ten feet I found myself in another
passageway parallel to the dead-end channel. This passage was full of
stalactites. A twenty-five foot walk took me to a fair-sized room.
I wont back to the mapping party and we mapped up to the dead endian
We then went on out and back to Blacksburg. We had spent four hours
in the cave and had map-ed .700 feet, some of it virgin passage. We
were surprised to find the weather nice when we came out but not too
happy to learn the outcome of the CIemson game,
