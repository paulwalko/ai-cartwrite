THE TECH TROGLODYTE
BANES' SPRING CAVE
BLAND COUNTY, VIRGINIA
Banes' Spring Cave is one of four caves located in the northern
flank of Walker Mountain, immediately below and northwest of the prom-
inent High Rock, on which stands a fire tower and which the Appalachian
Trail passes by. The other three caves in this group are Banes', New-
berry's, and Buddy Penley's.
la very short description of the cave is given in Douglas! Caves of
Virginia. It notes that the cave is a maze, more or less on two levels,
and that the length is 1750 feet. Through the survey completed by mem-
bers of the VPI Grotto in 1966, we found that the cave is developed on
two levels and is not really a maze, but rather a system of parallel
possages. These passages have developed in two directions, mainly
northeast-southwest and almost due east-west. Our completed survey en-
compassed 9,000 feet!
The limestone beds into which the cave has developed, dip into the
mountain. The entrance is in a streamib edat a point where the bottom
of a layer of sandstone is in contact with the top of a layer of lime-
stone into which the cave is developed. A concrete box sets above the
entrance to collect water from the stream during heavy rainfall and to
keep water from falling into the cave. This box was used at one time
as the water source for Mr. Banes' house; the water being transported
down the valley by a system of small pipes.
Recent work in Banes' Spring Cave by the VPI Grotto began during
our Fall Project in 1965. We had proposed to do surveying in Buddy Pen-
ley's Cave to see if it could be connected to Newberry's Cave, to check
several leads in Newberry's, and to explore Banes' Spring Cave more
thoroughly, since the description in Caves of Virginia seemed inadequate
in comparison with the nearby caves.
na the event of November 13, 1955, Barry Whittemore, Doug Draves,
Tom cht, Jack Keat, Rick Keener, R. E. Whittemore, and I explored the
cave, v entered by a slot on the right and dropped into a medium-sized
room, Vloriny several crawlways,
w e sünned as to where Thierry ·
got 1770 1204, Doug was not to be chiedo y lowering himself down a
series of pits on the left side of the anciance, he came to a crawlway
which looked impossible for anyone birt himself. We all got through, how-
ever, and immediately had to manipulate our bodies around a huge rock
slab which all but fills the passage. Once past this barrier the going
is easy. We followed a sinucus passage for about 500 feet, dropping down
at one point ten feet to a steam. Opis stream enters this passage near
the huge slab and winds wear and in the passage for the entire 500 feet.
At times, one can eithem d'op down to the stream level or take the
higher, drier route and co other times one is forced to be in the stream.
Movement in this passage consists of crawling, walking, and climbing, but
one feels that he has done a good deal of crawling once he is able to
stand again.
