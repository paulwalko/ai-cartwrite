missing. (Ed. note- this is usually the case.) Dr. Jackson said that
a pack rat had carried it away. I have my own ideas.
Our party then went to the blast furnace and tried to build a
fire. Quarterman must have thought that he was the missing link
or something for he immediately climbed up the side of the furnace
and had the time of his life calling "Gung Ho" and then tossing
bricks, boards, logs, etc. at us.
After the smoke came the rest of the parties and ran us out into
the cold. Luckily our spacious limosine soon arrived and brought us
back.
And thus it was that I became a caveman (some people doubt this
fact); and after coming out into the light, I reached the conclusion
that some people looked better in the dark.

Catawba Murder Hole
A party of fourteen cavers plus the driver and a friend left
the M.I. Building at 10 a.m. August 22, bound for the Murder Hole
north of Catawba. For the most part, the trip consisted of one
bump after another coupled with an ample supply of dust well mixed
with a fine collection af exhaust gasses. This mixture proved to
be a little too potent for one member of the party but soon recovered

However, in their place we were joined by Mr. Hopkins, Sr. and Hopkins,
Jr., age eleven, who incidentally supplied his own rope, smart boy.
A short climb up the mountain led us to the entrance of said
cave. Here we were all given a good laugh by the get-up Mr. Hopkins
had, old corroded clothes from various members of the group. Of
course, since Andrews wes with the party', the first job was to
partake of the growley, or is that spelled right? This proved to
be too painful a process for as usual Loyd was in great need of food
and, true to form, had none with him. However that good old "share
the growley" attitude that the club has, came to his rescue.
At just about noon the parties squared away and started in---
Crabb served as chief of party on the exploring and took along with
him the two Hops, Loyd, Moore, and Elson who was a newcomer to the
gang. Elson, being a soils technologist, decided to see what was
