thainuvitable picture taking, Wo_changed clothes and headed for the nearest
store to gorge ourselves on anything that was not a Nu-V Bar.
From my previous experience, despite Plummer's article in the Bulletin,
plus what we learned on this trip, camping trips in caves usually result
in more sleeping than work. We left two notable question marks and a
virgin pit unchecked, plus one passege unsurveyed. A twenty hour trip
would have accomplished as much if not more.
The "Space" Blankets worked very .well for their size (4"x2"x6" folded)
and weight (10oz.), and nothing else would have been easier to carry in
and kecp dry. The Nu-V Bars kept us alive, I guess, although they tasted
like Ivory Soap and contained only 200 calories. A hot drink is a must on
a long trip and bouillon is good although it does not contain much food
value. The dry clothes kept our rorale high, although they were a royal
pain in the "Crisco Way". In closing, I repeat, a twenty hour trip can
get as much done as a fifty hour expedition,

JOHN BROWN'S AND MOLER'S CAVES
MICHAEL FRIEDERS
DECEMBER 18, 1966
Personnel: Terry Pick, Gary Cooney, Flora Wells, Michael Frieders.
John Brown's is a cave whose entrance is a hole cut out of a railroad
by-way in Harpers Ferry. On arriving at the cave in about a foot 0:2 snow
we met a group of cavers from the D.C, Grotto that informed us that the
ceve was flooded and there was no use going in, but we did anyway. The
cave has quite large passage until you take one of the side passages which
ncrrows it out a little. It was in one of these pesrages that we found
about six feet of water so we turned back.
After a long snow bottle on the hill over the cove we decided to move
on down the road about three miles to Moler's Cave on Cave Hill Farm. The
farmer there has a log book which he likes to have everyone sign before
entering the cave. To get to the entrance you have to walk through a cow
pasture (watching where you step and huroring cows). The entrance is very
large with a lot of bresk-down in the initial passage. Most of the passage
is very large and can be. walked through. On this trip we went bck to
the sign saying "stream pas' age" and went down through a series of holes
to the stre?m passage.
We followed the passage for a while before meeting up mith group
of cavers from itorthern Virginia Toch which was making its way through
