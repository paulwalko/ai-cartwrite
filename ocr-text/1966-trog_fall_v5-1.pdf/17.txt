caves as well. Now that the mapping is completed, other studies can be
made. In this respect the cave has potential. As far as caving goes,
the cave provides a variety of physical exertions, but is not as im-
pressive as nearby caves.

and myself left Blacks-
burg to go to Newcastle
Murder Hole. After
trying to find H2S a
pair of gloves and
signing our lives away at the cave owner's house, we rappeled into the
cave at about two o'clock in the afternoon. After we did the 50 foot
entrance drop, we followed a walking, downhill passage. In this passage
were several small pits, which could be traversed. We did the traverses
and followed the passage into a room. It was a rather large room,
mostly filled with breakdown.
We climbed around the breakdown for a while and then climbed down
into a canyon which ran along the outside of the room. There was a
waterfall in the canyon and a stream. We followed the stream until we
came to a siphon. Hos climbed behind the waterfall but could not go
very far. We then climbed out of the canyon and continued down the
passage. We came to another pit which could be traversed. We all
looked at the hairy traverse and decided we all had homework to do so
we left the cave at six o'clock that same afternoon.
Note: The cave: owner does not want cavers to drive up to the cave
because it will kill the grass in his pasture. However, he will let you
park your car just inside the gate of the pasture.
