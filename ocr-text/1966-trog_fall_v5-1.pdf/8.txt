THE TECH TROGLODYTE
hopefully still attached. This method would be useless in, say, New-
berry's, but there are an infinite number of variations. Ingenuity
and common sense are closely related.
The second technique is known as the two-carabiner, two-prusik
hoist. Its rigging and operation are best described by the diagram.
With this method, two, or even one person can haul another person up
a drop. In its elementary form, the hauler has a 3-to-1 mechanical
advantage (theoretical), but an extra turn may be added for a slower
but easier 5-to-I advantage. The rig is not too complex, once its ope-
ration is understood, but practice is recommended.
Of course, no rescue technique will ever replace good, sound
judgement (regardless of what Billy Gus says). With winter caving upon
us, the use of good judgement becomes even more acute. After all, you
wouldn't want to miss the Spring Picnic, would you?

THE PIG HOLE BAT PROJECT
In the darly days of the VPI Cave Club, back in the early 1940's,
many of the club expeditions went to Pig Hole Cave. At that time the
only entrance to the cave was down the 120 foot free-fall drop. How-
ever, a survey indicated that a point far in the back section of the
cave was fourteen feet above ground; consequently, a new back: entrance
was dug. Wood and drain titles have since been used to keep the fif-
teen-inch square hole open.
As one approaches the last hundred feet of this back section, he
becomes aware of large deposits of bat guano, sometimes six feet deep,
on the floor. There has, in fact, been talk by several cavers about
mining these guano deposits. However, there are very, very few bats in
this area, or in the rest of the cave.
