*** FALL, 1966"
beneath the soil-after the pressure from Crabb and Edminster made the
trip the only way to ease the pain. For á few minutes Graves, the
driver, and his friend Miss, Miss, Oh, shucks I can't remember--can
you?, were also in that exploring party. However, the lack of radia-
tors and other means of keeping warm soon drove these two up to the
warmer climes. Close on the heels of this first party a survey party
composed of Jones (for the sake of accuracy in mapping), Southworth
(for the sake of getting into tight places), and Andrew. (for the sake
of a measuring stick in the tight squeezes), and Edminster (just for
the fun of it) came along shouting angles, lengths, walls and ceilings
and making black spots on the walls and blacker spots in a note book.
While the exploring party went on to rig the rope ladder down the
hole to the little lake that wasn't there, this party doubled back
under the exit or the entrance, however you want to look at it, and
found, after much grunting and groaning, a place where light entered
the cave. It was apparently a cleft in the rocks in the open chasm
at the entrance. It was impossible to go clear to the opening but
the map shows its general location. Down this same passage a bug
trap was found--three guesses are too many as to what that means--
that's it--Doc Jackson had come and gone from that same spot.
- Cra! (lected to descend the laduer to thc çreat unknown firstgis
créat were the grunts thereof as he descended „that tilted bit of some-
thing called a ladder. Finally, word came that it was muddy, at least
it wasn't lakey as we had expected it to be. After a few rather
casual remarks concerning the way the mud let one slip, there was
a more genteel report that there were initials in the mud. The report
that 1890 was one of the dates was the signal for the rest of the party
to start its descent just so that there would be some one there to look
after George in case he started to get violent. Well, it wasn't long
before the whole party had checked the fact that the date was just
what it had been reported. The whole center of the room consisted of
a low lying mud hill on which these letters and dates had been
scratched with fingers and other sharp tools. This was particularly
significant for there was evidence of a high water mark at least
thirty feet from the floor. Good evidence of the slowness of the
sedimentation in this particular cave.
We returned to campus having brought back no more people than we
took in. Indications for success - good indications.
