A TALE OF TWO RESCUES
pengence again, dear readers, we find ourselves in the throes of a .
Blacksburg winter; a little patch of Siberia in the Sunny South. .
To a caver, this could mean a number of things, among them are the
possibility of flash floods (if you're a West Virginia Caver), or wet, -
icy ropes in those well-known Virginia entrance drops. This last hazard
should bring to the VPI caveris mind two incidents that occurred last win-
ter, and the lessons learned (and unlearned) from chilly experience.
For new or non-VPI cavers, perhaps a brief recapitulation of these two
"rescues" is in order. First, however, it is interesting to note that
both rescues occurred only one week apart, with the successful" one oc-
curring before the lunsuccessfull.one.
The first occurrance took place at Člover Hollow Cave, in Giles :
County, Va. Alan formstrong, Gary Skaggs, Dave Strope, and John Peduzzi:
had entered the cave about three o'clock Saturday afternoon, rigging the
70-foot entrance drop with a 3-inch goldline rope. They returned to the
bottom of the drop around midnight and began the prusik out. Though no
appreciable amount of water was entering the pit, enough had accumulated
on the rope to freeze it into a solid icicle. Armstrong rigged in and
made the ascent with some difficulty. Gary Skaggs, a novice, started up
next. After considerable difficulty and backsliding; he made it up and
over the breakover. The rope was getting worse. Dave Strope began his ...
attempt. He made the first 20 feet by moving two feet up and sliding
one foot back. The dampness in the rope had been compressed into solid
ice. His knots began to slip, then slide uncontrollably. He made a
rapid, jerky descent and landed in the pile of decaying humus at the
bottom. Undaunted, he made a second attempt, only to experience a
second terrifying elevator ride into the wet leaves. Not wishing to ex-
haust himself, he decided to rest and let John Peduzzi try his luck.
Peduzzi would not give up without a fight, so he also made two attempts,
with results all too similar to Dave's. There was little doubt in their
minds that they were trapped. Any further attempts at prusiking would
only result in exhaustion. "There were no ladders on had long enough
for the pit, and too few persons: topside to do any hauling. A thick
layer of snow prevented hauling with the car. So they did the next best .
thing - they threw in the towel and went for help. Al and Gary arrived
back in Blacksburg about 2:00 aim. and found Ed Morgan: and me just re-
turning from another trip, Gene Harrison was still up studying and was
ready to go immediately. Barry Whittemore was notified and was standing
by with a car close at hand in case the rescue party had to phone for :
more help. He was the only person left on campus who knew a rescu è was
in progress, thus no unnecessary hysteria was created. .
The five of us then returned to the pit. The morale of the two
gentlemen at the bottom had not been dampened by their chilly vigil. A
hoist system was rigged whereby a rope was affixed to a tree above the
pit and ran down, through a carabiner on the "victim's!' chest harness,
