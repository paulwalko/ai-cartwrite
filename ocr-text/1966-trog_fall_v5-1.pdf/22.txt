Vol. V, no. 1
FALL, 1966,
was trapped at the bottom of a pit with no rope to the surface. So, on
the following nights, we hung a rope down from the skylight.
Early on Turkey Day, Bill, Phil and I set out to find Hairy Hole,
near East Stone Gap in Wise County. We spent some time searching the
brambles and cedars on the steep, limestone-outcropped hillside, but,
after locating an entrance to Powell River Cave and another entrance to
an unreported cave, Phil spotted the awesome pit.
We returned to the car for our gear. Upon reaching the cave again,
a young boy, out hunting, joined us. He seemed quite harmless, inspite
of his careless gun handling, until I was over the edge of the pit and
the others at the bottom. He wondered aloud, quite matter-of-factly what
would happen if someone cut our ropes.
The pit itself was a clean 120 feet, with many leads from top to
bottom. After initial exploration, we followed an old stream passage up-
stream and found ourselves in virgin. passage. Going back into the moun-
itain (sw), we found a series of crawls, canyons and climbable pits. Cir-
cling ground, we hit the stream passage again and followed it northeast,
possibly very close to. Powell River Cave, where a wet crawl dampened our
spirits. In this area we found several other crawls leading to larger
rooms and another stream. After finding 4000 feet of cave, 3000 feet of
it virgin, we prusiked out and headed for the hotel.
After exchanging tales with the fifteen or so others, we hit the
sack in anticipation of the morn.
On Friday, we drove to Gate City, met two young boys from Kingsport
and headed for Blair Cave.. We mapped our way through the entrance sec-
tion which was quite steep and very muddy. We soon found ourselves in a
stream passage about fifteen feet wide and twenty to thirty feet in
height. Occasionally, we went in up to our knees. The entire cave was
decorated heavily with flowstone draperies. After mapping about 900
feet downstream to a siphon, we found the same end about 400 feet up-
stream. In total, we mapped about 2000 feet leaving only two unchecked
leads.
This particular trip was very interesting, as the two boys had a
dialect all their own. One, Sam Taylor, entertained us with his story of
being one of three boys to find the largest ground sloth ever discovered.
It was about ll feet long, and he had kept it in his garage until it
started deteriorating. When he finally got around to telling the Smith-
sonian about it, they just about went crazy.
Again we returned to the Shelburne to swap stories with Jerry Freda
erick, Stan Carts, Dick Sanford and others. They had spent the past two
days in Crackerneck Saltpeter, Big and little Kelley and others.
