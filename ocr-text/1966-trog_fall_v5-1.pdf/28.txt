THE TECH TROGLODYTE
the cave with a minimum of equipmentLater on at the end of the passage,
we net the D. C. Grotto group again and followed them out of the stream
passege the same way we came into it. All in all there were about
nineteon cavers in the cave.
A second trip was made a week later on December 26, 1966, With Gary
Cooney, Bob Amundson, myself, my sister Lorraine and another girl, Chris
Casto. This trip was mainly to show the girls what caving was like.
These two caves are gront caves if you happen to live in the D.C. area
because it only tokes about an hour to get to them from D.C.

FLUTE CAVE
January 1, 1967
by Anne Whittemoré
Personnel: Tom Vigour, R. E. Whittemore, Barry Whittemore, Dave
Newson, Anne Whittemore.
Vig and Whitt contracted to survey Flute Cave in Pendleton County,
West Virginia during the ole New Year's party at the Fieldhouse.
Sunday morning dawned and we were still sacked out About 11:00
Barry stumbled over our tent and woke us up, After breakfast we sat
around the wood stove trying to get up nerve to go to Flute, Newson
got interosted in our leck of effort and joined the team. Vig lent
Barry one of his smelly shirts and Royster's hat and lamp so that
he could go too,
About 3:00 Vig said that he felt kind of sleepy, Whitt said,
"Let's go." Vig stumbled to the car and started getting his gear
together: 'Well, I don't think I can go; can't get my lamp apart,"
"Keep trying, Vig." "I can't go; I don't have any carbide." "Don't
worry, we've got extra." "Geez, I can't go; mý boots are frozen shut."
"Whitt, give Vig your old tenny pumps." "'My clean clothes are dirty;
don't guess I'll be able to go." "We'll put a poncho on the seat, Vig.!!
!! Guess I'll have to go."
