EDITOR'S NOTE
No other grotto has the long proud history that the VPI. Cave
Club has. Some of this history has been preserved in the Grotto
files which have been kept since the club began back in the early.
Forties.
Since the Club has not always had a medium of publication,
many of the adventures filed away in this voluminous subterranean
crypt have enjoyed but little attention. Beginning with this issue,
however, the editorial staff has decided to put some of this history
into print.
To find some historic trip reports for this quarter's issue,
we grope our way back into the dusty corridors of this hage limestone
vault to a door marked -- let's see -- how about 1943? (We're nearly
to the end of the corridor:) Now if we can just get this door open--
creeeeeeek...groan, ., squeak! -- there we are. There are lots of
drawers here; wonder what we can find in the one marked "C"? Hmmm--
county maps, carbide prices, campus regulations, Clover Hollow...
here's a thick one; "Catawba Murder Holell... sounds exciting...here's
another; "Canoe Cave"... that should be enough for this issue.
So here they are, dedicated to old Timers, armchair. cavers,
and other alumni of the VPI Grotto; our trip reports from...
THE KARSTOPHAGUS
Canoe Cave
After awakening in the middle of the night (8 a.m.) and eating
a good wholesome breakfast in the mess hall, the Grotto (accompanied
by yours truly) made its sojourn to Canoe Cave. This is indeed
a cavern resplendent in its cleanliness-- mud galore..
The entire group of cavers gathered at the Finger of God for
religous services, after which the partiu qushed on to their various
missions; the party to which I was assigned had as its mission
general sightseeing. Nothing exciting happened after the first hour,
then Cartwright found a new passageway which we went down. Crawling
down a forty-five degree slope, at times sliding on the omnipresent
mud, we went through a narrow"coin slot!! and down a drop on a slimy
slippery rope to a room which had as its main attraction, a lake.
We later found this lake to be quite deep; for proof see Sharp. .
Caldwell almost went for a swim ,but in spite of all we could do
to prevent it, he managed to catch himself.
It then felt like dinner time to me, but.we ate about. two hours :
later. Everything was perfect except that I found part of my food
