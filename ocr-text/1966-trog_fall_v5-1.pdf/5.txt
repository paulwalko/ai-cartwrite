THE TECH TROGLODYTE
back up through a nylon pully suspended from another tree above the pit, :..
thence down the hill to the four people who would do the bulk of the
hauling. A fifth person, stationed near the pit, helped with the hauling
and relayed signals.
John and Dave were on the surface in a matter of minutes. They were:
in as good a condition as the rest of us. They had done the wisest thing.
When the snow had covered our footprints, the world and the Roanoke
Times were oblivious to anything unusual that had occurred that night.
The second incident took place at Catawba Murder Hole, in Botetourt
County, Va. Many tales of fiction based on the incidents surrounding:
this rescue" have been publicized in the various news media. It is
perhaps unnecessary, therefore, to relate such a detailed account, but,
for the record, here are a few of the undistorted facts.
Catawba Murder Hole. has a small entrance in the side of a large,
steep-sided sink. The entrance room is shaped like an oblong funnel
with a 60 foot pit in the center. A handline is usually rigged from
the top of the sink to the entrance, and another rigged from inside the
entrance down to a flat-floored area adjacent to the pit, When five
cavers from Blacksburg entered the cave late Saturday afternoon, there
was an appreciable amount of water pouring into the pit.
Of the five persons in the party, only one, Carole Noble, was a
member of the VPI Grotto. She had very limited vertical experience at
the time. Rick Keener, a non-member at the time, had some vertical ex-
perience. The other three (Bob Williams, Glen Davis, and Joe Kreck) were
novices, but had done some limited vertical work.
The party deemed the water not to be a hazard, and, using a ż-inch
nylon rope, proceeded to the lower level of the cave. They spent several
hours on the lower level, then began the prusik out. Joe Kreck started
our first, but experience lamp trouble ten feet off the floor. The
water entering the pit was fresh snow-melt, so his hands were too numb
to make any repairs. He finally made it up with some difficulty, but
was completely drenched and, needless to say, quite cold. Keener as-
cended next with no difficulty. Kreck then informed Keener that he
would return to the car to change into some dry clothes, then summon
the local rescue squad. Keener tried to disuade Kreck, and Kreak ap- :
peared to agree with him, but would return to the car for dry clothes,
nonetheless. It was a quarter-mile walk to the car and several nearby
houses. When Kreck got there, he called the Troutville Rescue Squad
while a dozen experienced VPI Cavers sat in their rooms back at school.
Meanwhile, back at the pit, the three remaining novices made the..
ascent without serious incident. Às they were preparing to leave the :
cave, however, they were greeted by a glare of spotlights and the
shouts of the rescue squad. The County Sheriff was on hand to harangue
