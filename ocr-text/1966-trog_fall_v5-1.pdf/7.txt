FALL, 1966
the students, along with a reporter and several T.V. cameras from Roa-
noke. Since the whole rescue was in effect a false alarm, the repor-
ter composed a sensational piece of fiction to justify being called out
into the snow.
In a trip report, later, Joe Kreck made a statement to the effect
that it was better to be embarrassed that nothing happened, than to be
sorry later that something did and no help was, available. By comparing
this incident with the one a week earlier at Clover Hollow, one may
easily see that this reasoning is fallacious.
First; at Clover Hollow, something did happen. Two men were actu-
ally trapped and rescued, but no one was embarrassed nor sorry later.
At Catawba Murder Hole, no one was trapped, but people were both em-
barrassed and sorry later. The cavers were embarrassed, the members of ...
the VPI" Grotto were sorry...
Second; the people at Clover Hollow knew how to handle an emergency
situation and did so quite efficiently. The people at Catawba Murder
Hole did not know how to handle even a potential emergency, and blun-
dered their way into enough bad publicity to last the VPI Grotto for
years to come.
The point is this: use good judgement. If and when that fails,
then know something about how to handle the results. One helpful piece
of information is knowing whom to call. Use your CRCN list, (or call
the U.Va, Security Office at 1-295-2166), also, "Harrison's Handy
Handout" may be most helpful for a local rescue. Nat Cap is about as
good as the Roanoke Times as far as bad publicity is concerned, but
this is up to the individual.
Another bit of knowledge that is often overlooked is the various
self-rescue techniques. Although their application is somewhat limited,
they can be real life-savers in, say, a Tazewell County pit where help
would be long in arriving. Two such techniques will be presented here.
The first is a method of eliminating waterfall problems. Many
times, when prusiking in a direot waterfall becomes difficult, a per-
son at the bottom of the drop can hold the rope aside, thus keeping the
prusiker away from the water. But, one may ask, what happens to the
last man? This requires some ingenuity. Two ropes are rigged for the
drop, the prusik rope being passed around a stationary object and at-
tached end-to-end with the second rope. The second rope is held taut
from above. The last man may now prusik free from the direct. force of
the water. This method was used effectively in Cassell's Cave (Poca-
hontas County, West Virginia) a few years ago. This method may also be
employed when spin becomes a problem. As long as the prusiker's center
of gravity is not under the tie-in, his weight will prevent him from
spinning. The ropes are retrieved by untying the main rope and letting
'it fall into the pit. The second rope is hauled up with the main rope
