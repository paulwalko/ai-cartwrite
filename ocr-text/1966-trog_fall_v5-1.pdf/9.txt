FALL, 1966.?
It is the theory of several of us that at one time there were 'ter-
rific colonies of bats in this area, but the opening of the new en trance
caused tria passage to dry out, thus forcing the bats to leave. Or per-
haps it was the draft of varying temperature that did it.
Regardless, two years ago, several of us built a wooden cover for
the new entrance which cuts down considerably on the amount of draft.
Since that time we have noticed that there seem to be more bats in this
back area now. If we are to draw any conclusions whatsoever, I believe
that now is the time to begin counting the bats in this area so that we
may note whether there is any significant change in the years to come.
Due to the low ceiling of the passage in this area, I think that it
would be possible to mark off boundaries, about 200 feet from each other
and about the width of the passage. Then possibly four times a year,
someone could go through that section and make a physical count of the
bats. Of course, the season and time of day will be important factors,
but these are not major problems if enough counts are made, assuming
that the counts are accurate and they are carried out over a long period
of time,
.
I would appreciate any ideas, comments, or suggestions on this pro-
posal.
On February 26, I made the first counting trip. I found 37 bats
in the section between the Mud Bridge and the back entrance. Included
in this group were two types of bats: small brown bats and social bats.
There was slight snow cover and the temperature was in the low 20's.

AROUND THE REGION
The 13th annual meeting of the Virginia Region was held at the Uni-
versity of Virginia, in Charlottesville, Saturday, November 22, 1966.
Seventy-five people, representing eight area grottos and the West Vir-
ginia Association of Cave Studies, attended.
The main program, consisting of three informative talks, was held
in the afternoon. Dr. John R. Holsinger discussed the Surgenor's-Galla-..
han System in Lee County, Virginia John M. Rutherford explained the
purposes and aims of the West Virginia Association of Cave Studies, and
then discussed the Great Savannah Project which the group is now engaged
with. R.E. Whittemore presented a very enlightening program on the work
being done in southwestern Virginia by the VPI Student Grotto. .
