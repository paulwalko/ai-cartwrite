THE TECH TROGLODYTE
One notable investigation led up a steep, muddy climb and down
into a underground pond. A successful attempt was made to link this
passage with a crawlwa" on the other side of a rock wall.
The last and largest room of the system held the surprising
climax to our surveying trip. Several small crawlways led from this
room. One led to a maze of small stream courseways which branched
and often dead-ended, or looped back to the last large room.
Another portion of this crawlway made a U-shaped detour from the
passage into a room with a vertical shelf and a corkscrew walkway
about fifteen feet long. Another crawlway on the side led under and
around the last, large room. Also, it is possible to connect this large
room with the one that precedes it by a circular crawlway and a passage
through some tight formations,
This trip took place on November 13, 1966. Only 1400feet of virgin
cave were surveyed; however, the cave has the potential for more investi-
gation of its system of ëntrances and passageways: "

On the Wednesday night preceeding
Thanksgiving, Phil Lucas (formerly of VPI)
and I met Bill Biggers in Blacksburg and
headed southwest for the weekend. On ar-
riving in Pennington Gap, we checked in at
the Shelburne "Tourist" Hotel where many
other cavers were already assembled. Holsinger's and Baroody's voicės
led us to the room of activity.
MACAM ADAT
Our gracious acceomodations were a central room (with central 95°F
heating) which didn't include any windows, only an eerie skylight. Phil
complained the following morning of awakening in his sleep and seeing the
moonlight filtering down through the skylight shaft, foggily thinking he
