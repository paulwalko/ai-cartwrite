The group consisted of Tony, Val and myself and I
felt privileged that Tony had arranged a trip for my
visit. Withy Hill is one of the two or three most highly
decorated caves I've ever seen, beautiful white and
yellow formations everywhere, and at the end of the
main passage, a small grotto that was breathtaking,
with a deep green rimstone pool, festooned with
white and transparent flowstone and stalactites. The
closest I can come in comparison is that it's like the
Queen's Bath in Pig Hole on steroids. Because of the
long closure and the controlled access, the cave is
mostly in pristine condition. Many caves in the Men-
dips are gated, and the local caving clubs have keys.
Frequently they are in sinkholes in farm fields, just
like in Virginia. One thing notable is that I've never
seen graffiti or trash in a British cave.
Outside of the Mendips, I've been to one cave in
South Wales, Ogof Ffynnon Ddu II (that translates
to Black Spring Cave II). South Wales caves typically
have big booming passages, like some in Monroe and
Greenbrier counties, W.V. They are very different
than Mendip caves, and very impressive. The third
major caving region in the U.K. is the Yorkshire
Dales in Northern England. I haven't been there yet,
but my impression is that the Dales are the TAG of
England, with world-famous vertical caves. As is true
in continental Europe, vertical caving in England re-
lies heavily on rebelays and smaller diameter rope.
Tony jokingly refers to that system as SRT (single
rope technique) and our style as SRD (sling the rope
down).
Caving in the U.K. has been a very enjoyable experi-
ence, both with the opportunity to experience great
caving in another part of the world, and with the in-
credibly welcoming hospitality I've received from the
MNRC In addition to Lynn and myself, they have
also hosted Amy Johnson on a trip a couple of years
ago, and would likely do the same for other VPI
cavers.
Seven MNRC members are coming to Convention
this summer at the OTR site and then spending the
following week in Blacksburg. I hope many of us will
take that opportunity to renew old friendships or to
meet them for the first time.
