(the 300 used to double rig the canyon
looked a little less than ugly). However,
I am sure that I will get lots more prac-
tice honing this skill. Anyway, we all fi-
nally made it to the entrance where we
shuddered to think of how cold it was
up there. Kirk climbed rope first and I
eagerly went second. I tried to climb
fast so I could build up some body heat
so maybe it wouldn't feel so cold at the
top. By the time I was up, Kirk was feel
ing better, so I made my way to the car
and got the heat cranking while I
changed. It was very cold while we
waited for what seemed like ALL
NIGHT for everyone to climb out. Fi-
nally we got the rope de-rigged and all
the gear loaded into the car. Then we
came back to Blacksburg, and I slept
for a long time.
