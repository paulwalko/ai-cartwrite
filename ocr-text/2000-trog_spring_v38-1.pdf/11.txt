rest of us made a more leisurely hike out the next day.
Tex jacket and standing beneath the chilling water.
Dennis made him stay under long enough to snap a
picture. After that it was time to leave.
The trip out was uneventful except for one incident.
Dan dropped the same expensive jacket from the top
of the pit, scaring the crap out of me at the bottom
On the surface Pat and Dennis cruised quickly down
to camp. They packed up and hiked out that after
noon, called back by real-world responsibilities. The
more to be learned about the caves of this area. Next
year's expedition will focus on more cave survey and
a promising dig that will require the efforts of a ded-
icated crew. Cavers come back year after year to work
and explore. Thanks to the remoteness and alpine
conditions there is still more to discover.
