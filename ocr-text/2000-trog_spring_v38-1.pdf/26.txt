FORMATIONS
In spite of the profusion of sticky clay in most of the
passages, the cave has numerous small calcite forma-
tions of great beauty. Most of these formations are a
muddy brown in color but several white crystalline
stalactites and stalagmites are found in the main pas-
sage, while the left wall near Station 48 is covered
with a glistening coat of white flowstone. The cave
also contains several small formations of rimstone,
but no helectites, oulopholites, oolites, or cave pearls
are present.
BIOLOGY
No cave life was observed, even the usual bats and
salamanders were absent. No insect traps were set so
it is possible that the cave contains some minute in-
sect life that is not easily observed.
FOLKLORE
The numerous initials and markings on the walls of
the cave are ample evidence that the cavern is well
known to the people living in the immediate vicinity.
However, no folklore was volunteered by the owner
or any neighboring farmers, so evidently none of the
usual tales or murder, suicide, or buried treasure are
linked with this cave. The cave had no specific name
so the Grotto named it after the owner, Mr. W. N.
Southem.
COMMERCIAL POSSIBILITIES
The formations present in this cave are numerous but
so small in size that any commercialization of the
cave as a tourist attraction is extremely improbable.
The small size of the passages and the generally mud-
dy condition of the cave further decrease its commer-
cial possibilities. The drop at the entrance and the
muddy intenor also prevent its use as a storehouse.
