SOUTHERN'S CAVE INTRODUCTION
The V.P.I. Grotto is a student branch of the National
Speleological Society, an organization devoted to the
scientific study of caves. This Grotto, known around
the Blacksburg region as The Cave Club, is composed
of students and instructors at Virginia Polytechnic
Institute who are interested in discovering, exploring,
and investigating all caves in the surrounding area.
The V.P.I. Grotto offers a cash reward for informa-
tion concerning any caves over a half-mile long and
within a 30 mile radius of Blacksburg. A prize of $5
for every mile of cave is offered, with the stipulation
that the cave must be previously unknown to the
Grotto. (See Fig 1.)
On June 14, 1947, Mr. LeRoy Williams of Christians-
burg, Va. informed the Cave Club of a hitherto un-
known cave on the farm of Mr. W. N. Southern one
and one-half miles south of [cave location omitted].
The cave had never been visited by a member of the
N.S.S., but it was supposed to be quite large, with
many rooms and several long passages.
INVESTIGATION
On June 22, 1947, an advance party of 5 Grotto
members followed Mr. Williams' directions and lo
cated the cave without any difficulty. The cave was
situated in Elbrook Dolomite and was entered by way
of a small hole 2 feet wide and 3 feet high. A sheer
drop of 25 feet just inside the entrance necessitated
the use of a rope, all other passages were negotiated
without assistance. (See Fig. 3.) The cave was com-
pletely explored and, due to the difficulty of estimat-
ing distances underground, was thought to approach
the one-half mile minimum of the Club's reward of-
fer.
SURVEY AND DETAILED EXAMINATION
On July 20, 1947, a large party of Grotto members re-
turned to the cave for the purpose of making a survey
and examining in detail the various features of the
cave. A rope ladder was used to negotiate the 25 foot
drop at the entrance. A surveying party of four then
proceeded to survey the cave with a Brunton pocket
transit and a steel tape while two other parties exam-
ined the passages and calcite formations in more de-
tail.
EXTENT OF THE CAVERN
The main passage of the cave runs in a general north-
northwest direction and the far end of this main pas-
sage is 635 feet from the entrance and north 39 de-
grees 30 minutes west of the entrance. Due to the 25
foot drop and the gently sloping floor of the cave, the
far end lies 85 feet lower than the entrance. The en-
trance is on the south slope of a small hill so the ex-
treme end of the cave lies more than 100 feet below
the surface of the ground. The total length of the pas-
sages is 1335 feet
HYDROLOGY
The cave has no stream flowing through it, but, in
spite of this fact, it is extremely damp and contains
much seepage from the red clay soil above. The floor
is flooded to a depth of several inches in two places
and the last half of the main passage is lined with sev-
eral inches of wet, red clay which is very viscous and
plastic.
Way Back is a series of articles pulled from the club archives. Every once in awhile it's nice to be reminded
that this cave club has a long and rich history of cave exploration. The idea and this submission came from
Lawrence Britt, keeper of the club files.
