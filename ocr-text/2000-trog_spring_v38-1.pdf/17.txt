You Can Only Be So Serious with Pants Full of Cheese
by Bob Cohen (Guru and Wearer of Lactose Tolerant Underwear)
Surprise Cave continues to pleasantly live up to its
name. On a recent trip to the cave I somehow got
separated from Chris' group. Bob Z. heard about a
shortcut to the Heaven area. We were checking it out
when I saw a lead that had my name on it. Some mys-
terious force drew me on, and I lost the group or they
lost me. It compelled me to keep going into a passage
I had never seen before. I heard a voice and thought
it was Chris and our new Russian cayer friend. I
crawled and climbed to the voice. It turned out to be
a false god named Harry who was on an early trip (big
surprise) with Barbara. They were on their way out
when I met them on top of the Corkscrew. However
it worked, I found another way from the top of the
Corkscrew to the main stream passage. Bob Z. found
a shortcut to Heaven. These routes were far from vir-
gin, but they were new to us. It's nice to fantasize
about being the first, just like dating.
Some years ago one surprise the cave summoned up
was quite outstanding. I had some cavers in from out
of town. Mutual caver friends set it up for them to see
me and go caving. They were my friends' work ac-
quaintances.. As far as my friends knew, my guests
were serious geology types. The instructions I re-
ceived were, “Show them a good cave, but don't get
too silly or wild.” (What, me?)
We went to Surprise Cave. I decided to pack a snack
of
for all. It consisted of an assortment of crackers in a
Nalgene jar and two cans of that pressurized cheese
product. This is the stuff that needs no refrigeration
and will last into the next Ice Age. It comes out of a
nozzle, flowerette style, like whipped cream, so it can
remain untouched by inhuman cave hands. This
seemed like a perfect cave food.
I ran out of room in my cave pack, so I put the two
cans with the capped nozzle down in my front hip
pockets of my coveralls. We were on a mellow sight-
seeing trip, so I thought this arrangement was fine. I
forgot all about the cans after the beginning of the
trip. When we all cleared the bottom of the Cork-
screw, I started having a slight sensation of my lower
cave like my outfit was shrinking. At first I wrote it
off to putting on a few pounds. As the trip went on,
I acted as a serious tour guide to these serious folks.
Everything went fine, but I couldn't shake the feeling
of my suit getting tighter. At one point I slipped and
slammed my leg. I braced for the pain as I hit the
rock, but it barely hurt. I continued my role as guide
until someone in the group said, “This cave is unusu-
al; it smells like Swiss and cheddar.” Then it hit me
what was going on. A quick check of my pockets con-
firmed the curdled facts. The caps came off the two
cans in a crawlway. The nozzles ripped a hole inside
my coveralls, broke off, and filled my outfit with two
kinds of cheese. I decided to hide the truth and go on
with the show. This worked until I started to lead up
a tight climb. My cheesy past was revealed when each
leg bottom produced a different flavored yellow
mass. The group realized at once what happened and
produced a laugh that reverberated through the entire
cavern. We all just sat down and told a whole bunch
of raunchy jokes and cheesy stories..
The rest of the trip was considerably more silly. I tried
to keep a straight face and point out speleothemes,
but the rest of the crowd wanted more from me now.
When I tried to continue, they dropped their pants in
unison and made animal sounds. My surrender took
the form of all of us exiting the cave in Monty Python
silly walking style. They all assured me they had a
great unforgettable time and wanted me to promise
another cheese performance the next time they were
in town. Days later my friends wanted to know how
it went with their serious co-workers. I told them,
“You can only be so serious with pants full of
cheese.”
One last note of a more serious nature. The cheese
padded my leg from being hurt when I hit it on a
rock. Maybe cave suits could be designed with CP.S.
(cheese protection system). Imagine pressurized cans
connected to shock and motion sensors that would
immediately fill your suit with cheese to prevent inju-
ry. I could see somebody taking a fall down a large pit
and no one getting too concerned. They should just
have a large amount of crackers and wine on hand for
the clean-up.
