Potholing with the M.N.R.C.
by Walt Pirie
MNRG, you ask? Yep, that's the official name of the
British caving club that visited us, summer of '97. It
stands for the Mendip Nature Research Committee.
A pretty awesome name for a caving club, but then
it's England. Besides, the club was founded in 1906
and in the early days, caving was just one of its major
interests. The MNRC is located in the Mendip Hills
in Southwest England, one of the three major caving
areas in England. I've been caving there several times
now, and I thought I'd try to give a brief impression
of Mendip caving. Before my first trip, in December,
1995, I admit to being quite leery of caving in En-
gland. All I had heard indicated they were small, wet,
cold, flood-prone, dangerous, and very difficult. And
the only visual impression I had was from the Sid
Perou film of Otter Hole, parts of which would be
enough to make me give up caving. But I still wanted
to give it a try. That became possible when I hooked
on the intemet with Denzil Brown, one of the
blokes who was here in '97. He invited me over that
first year, and off I went. Well, caving aside, I had a
great time on that trip. In true caver fashion we par-
tied, pub-hopped, ate like a SIVTAC food orgy,
hiked, and in general I had a ball. I also learned that
funky nicknames are not unique to the VPI club.
Members of the MNRC go by such monikers as
“Mushroom.” “Droid.” “Womble,” and so on. Is it
any wonder we've gotten along with them so well?
The caving was great too, and not nearly as forbid-
ding as I had originally feared. I caved mostly with
Denzil, Tony Littler, Angus (Dave Bell), and Tufty
(Dave Tuffery), all of whom were on the trip over
here a year and a half later. Before I could go caving,
I had to buy some caving gear, as mine had been sto-
len in a London train station on the way to the club.
In the nearby small city of Wells, Somerset, a caver by
the name of Tony Jarrett (J-rat) runs what I think is
the only caving vendor in the world set up in a regular
store in the downtown shopping area. The shop is
called Bat Products. The club was able to lend me
most of what I needed, but at Bat Products I pur-
chased two things which are standard caving clothing
in England and different from what most U.S. cavers
use. The first was rubber boots, which they call “Wel-
lies,” short for Wellingtons. A few U.S. cavers use
them and although their traction isn't the greatest,
they are really nice in wet caves. The other was a “fur-
ry suit,” which I've never seen in the U.S. It's a one-
piece long-john made of thick, piled material for
wearing under caveralls, and is pretty standard in En-
gland. They tend to be a bit warm for me, but again,
helpful in wet caves.
In the Mendips, my first cave was White Pit. This
cave was discovered only around 1990. The passage
is kind of small, and the cave is a bit muddy but not
what I would call wet. It has some small, very pretty
white formation areas, and overall it was a pleasant,
fairly easy trip. The biggest surprise was that the tem-
perature in Mendip caves is about the same as in Vir-
ginia: in the low 50's. By the way, a second myth
about British caving was dispelled on that and subse-
quent visits. I have never heard a member of the
MNRC refer to caving as potholing.
The second trip that first year was to Swildon's Swal-
lett, the longest cave in the Mendips, at just under 6
miles. This cave was quite different, involving a lot of
moderate breakdown climbing. It was mostly clean,
bare limestone and quite wet, but not enough to be
unpleasant. The entrance series was mostly a break-
down crawl and climb-down ending with a cable lad-
der. As I was climbing down the ladder through a
very light waterfall, the light seemed to be playing
tricks on me in the spray. When I got to the bottom
I found out why. I looked to my left and there was a
Christmas tree, complete with blinking colored lights.
I think they were operated with a motion sensor. Ap-
parently it's traditional for some group to pull a prank
like that in Swildon's at Chrismas. How they ever got
it through the entrance series I'll always wonder. No
one with me knew which group had done it. We then
climbed and crawled down to the stream level at
Sump 1. Sumps are a common feature in the lower
levels of Mendip caves and I think there are 9 just in
Swildon's. Some are quite short and free-diveable,
but we didn't attempt that on this trip. That's some-
thing I'd like to try on a future trip.
So far I've done eight caves in the Mendips and the
most spectacular was in March of this year (2000). In
late 1999 a cave called Withy Hill was re-opened after
being closed for over twenty years. It had been
owned by a quarry and no access was permitted. Like
a few sensitive caves there, a trip must be arranged
with and led by an approved leader. In this cave, the
leader limits the party to three cavers in addition to
himself, because of the delicate nature of the cave.
