bells out and the rappel is free. Frank's is the nicest
pit I have done so far in Colorado. It looks and feels
a lot like something in TAG, deep and broad and aes-
thetically pleasing. The temperature is a good remind-
er of the alpine setting, though.
A few minutes later all six of us were at the bottom
of Frank’s Pit and the through trip could begin. We
made another short rappel between some break-
down. This brought us into a room with marmot and
pack rat skeletons fused into flowstone in the floor.
We used flagging tape to mark their locations so that
other cavers would not trample them. .
The next notable passage was the Sand Crawl Belly
crawling is not so bad when the floor is nice and soft;
too bad it was sopping wet. The Sand Crawl brought
us out into a small room. Here was another exposed
climb, this time fifteen feet up flowstone. I got up it
first and ended up in the lead. That did not last long
because I missed the turn to the Black Slide. Once I
was back on track I followed Pat and Dennis on the
climb up to the slide. The Black Slide is a steep slope
of dark flowstone that one has to traverse. The low
end tongues out into the top of a tall room. Obvious-
ly you do not want to fall while crossing. Jim told me
that they usually crossed it by balancing on the small
slick knobs in the middle of the slope. I had seen
Dennis and Pat cross the top where the close ceiling
makes it possible to safely chimney across. After tak-
ing this path myself I managed to convince Jim to do
the same. I am not certain that he liked it better.
Now we found ourselves at the Overhanging Dome
Room. This was the site of another accident back in
1990. One must negotiate a 20 foot overhanging
climbdown by use of a wet etrier permanently in
stalled in the cave. Helen Hassemer was just below
the lip of the drop when she fell, landing on her back
Luckily her pack took some of the impact. Helen was
hurt but there was nothing to do but continue mov-
ing toward the lower entrance. She made it out of the
cave and down the mountain. X-rays showed that she
had cracked two yertebrae. Needless to say she was
very lucky. This incident was on my mind as I nego
tiated the lip. It was awkward, but not impossible.
Upper body strength is the key. If your arms are
strong enough you do not have to fiddle around get-
ting a foot in each loop of the etrier.
When everyone was safely at the bottom of the climb
we took our one and only break of the trip. Dan
pulled out a down parka. Even though it was damp it
looked nice and warm. I never even sat down on the
cold rock but it still only took me five minutes to get
chilly in this breezy room. Fortified with some food
we pressed on to the Coral Slide. I was in the lead
again and discovered the Slide to be a steeply sloped
funnel shaped room. The funnėl led down into black-
ness. I climbed down cautiously at first until I realized
that the slide got its name from its incredibly grippy
surface.
Being in front for the Coral Slide meant that I was the
first one into the next section. The T-Slot is just what
the name implies. It is a slot shaped like a T that is just
small enough to keep your head level with your
shoulders as you move forward. Oh, and the bottom
of the T bells out into a black chasm that roars with
water far below. I pushed forward with Pat on my
heels and once we were on the other side it did not
seem so bad.
Once everyone had made it across the Slot we made
our way to the Second Great Room. This was a tall
diagonal fissure of a room with no visible ceiling. We
traversed it by some breakdown wedged thirty feet up
from the floor. As we left the Second Great Room we
searched for a lead that Jim wanted to check. We ney-
er found it, but Jim did not seem to mind. Soon we
were at the Oxbows. The Oxbows are tall sinuous
passages with fairly smooth walls. They weave dra-
matic curves like an old river. At one point there is a
true oxbow in the passage. An overly sharp bend has
actually been separated from the main flow of the
passage. The Oxbows have no floor. They simply get
extremely narrow at their bottom. This forces a per-
son to chimney along above the narrow spots. I
found the Oxbows to be great chimneying. Pat and I
charged forward in sheer enjoyment of this wonder-
ful section of cave
We dropped out of the Oxbows into the Register
Room. After adding our names we listened for the
others. As soon as they were in earshot Pat and I took
off down the Moonmilk Passage. Pasty white moon-
milk seemed to glow on the walls. This brought us
quickly to the final obstacle of the through trip: a
traverse across the nameless pit near the lower en-
trance. There is a crawlway on the far side of the pit.
Thirty feet down the crawlway is the lower entrance
to Spanish. Strong incurrents of air suck winter
snows through the crawl and into the pit. Here the
breeze loses its strength and drops the snow on the
edge of the pit. Normally this provides a nice snow-
bank on which to traverse the pit. This past winter
was fairly light on snow and so the snowbank was
nonexistent. I checked out the new traverse and
found only one tricky spot, a step around a blank wall
to a muddy ledge. There was one finger hold to help
