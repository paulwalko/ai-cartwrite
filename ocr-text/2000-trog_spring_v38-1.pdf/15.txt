BANQUET
The Newport Rec Center continues as our favorite
place to hold Banquet, despite the mix-up of dates
this year. Traditionally on the Saturday of President's
Day weekend, the Rec Center double booked their
space and eventually bumped VPI to the following
weekend. Attendance was high, though, and hopeful-
ly didn't prevent any out-of-towners from making the
trip.
Bill Balfour presented a slide show and talk on Doe
Mountain Cave (DMC), the latest cave-craze in Giles
County. The DMC stories are gaining a life of their
own; be sure to catch this slide show on Saturday
evening at the Spring VAR.
The dinner was excellent, as Steve “Tink” Williams
never lets us down. The awards ceremony highlighted
the best (and worst!) of our grotto members' behav-
ior. Here are just a few of the awards given out (hey,
if you want to hear them all, you have to go to Ban-
quet!): Matt Burnett received a golden radiator for his
Bronco wannabe, the Steves received certificates for
finding “The Second-deepest Pit in Virginia,” Mike
Homne presented himself with the Armchair Caver
award, Joe Thompson received the Safe Driver
award, and of course there were lots of Guano Clus-
ters.
Banquet co-chair Wil Orndorff livened up the crowd
late in the evening by performing what is now called
the Millennium Dance with trainee Mandie Aldrich.
If you've never seen Wil wearing only a black teddy,
be grateful.
NCRC INVASION
Several VPI cavers have recently completed ad-
vanced NCRC training and are encouraging trainees
and members alike to participate in an upcoming
weekend-long orientation to cave rescue. Matt Bur-
nett, Joe Thompson, and Brad Atkinson were pleased
with the extensive training and are ready to contrib-
ute their knowledge when needed. (Just keep them
away from cell phones.)
GRACE, THY NAME 18 WELLS
Steve Wells, master climber himself, managed to fall
three feet and knock his shoulder out of joint while
caving last month. Unfortunately Steve LePera, the
only other person on the trip, has no medical training
and wasn't able to pop the shoulder back into place.
LePera caved out and, after several hours of debate,
decided to call a few friends to help drag Wells from
the cave. Turns out some drugs were all it took to
loosen the shoulder and it popped back in nicely.
Once back in one piece, Wells raced out of the cave
and managed to beat most of
and managed to beat most of his assisters” by an
hour. Within thirty seconds of his exit, Wells was
drinking a beer, smoking a cigarette, and laughing
about his misadventure.
On a more serious note, this brought to light a real
concem which was previously unaddressed. Based on
this latest experience, the club has recently passed a
measure requiring anyone who goes on a 12+ hour
caving trip with Wells to be a certified and current
EMT.
SPEAKING OF VICES
The club recently elected their new officers. The
President is Eric Stanley, the Vice President is Chris
Hibshman, the Treasurer is Scott Rapier (the new dy-
nasty?), and the Secretary is Matt Stec. Thanks to the
previous officers who did such a great job for with
club (except the Secretary, who shall be banished to
his kayak).
Amy Johnson, now living in Colorado, was recently
elected the President of the Colorado Grotto. The
time spent as VPI's secretary clearly whet her appetite
for “The Big Chair.” Does this mean she now gets to
tell Carl Bern when he'll cave and where?
YTR
Once again, YTR (Young Timer's Reunion) took
place at the WVACS site. The campground emptied
on Saturday afternoon as most of the attendees went
underground. Mixed grotto trips went to Culverson
Creek, Hurricane Ridge, Bone/Norman, and Organ
Cave. (Apparently this year's Culverson Creek trip
did not contain any height restrictions.) The rain held
off until Sunday moming as most people packed up
and went home.
PICNIC
This year's picnic was mostly cold and windy (sur-
prise!), but that didn't stop the diehards from biking
to Bland on Saturday. Sandy Knapp, the only woman
to tough it out, managed to sail past many of the men
with ease. Later she tried to downplay it out of con-
cern for their fragile egos.
Concerned about the unprotected key of Newcastle's
Brown Ale at the picnic site, bikers Philip Balister and
Ko Takamizawa planned ahead: the tap to that keg
travelled to Picnic in Ko's backpack
Several groups of cavers actually caved on Saturday.
Kirk Digby suckered Ed Fortney into taking a trainee
trip to Newberry's. Despite having five trainees on
the trip, they managed to exit the cave before dinner
