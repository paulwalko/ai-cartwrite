THE PASSING OF A FRIEND
The sad news just arrived that Alejandro Villagomez,
a long time Texas caver, friend and ex-husband of
Maureen Handler, and friend of many VPI cavers,
died a week ago in Mexico. It was not caving related
and the details are not yet known, but they won't
change the sadness cavers all over are feeling now.
OTR AND CONVENTION
Once again, VPI kicked some serious rope-running
ass at OTR, bringing home many first and second
place prizes. Sue Setzler and Zenah Orndorff duked
it out in knots, frog, and rope walker. The end result
had Sue beating Z in knots and rope walker.
Unfortunately for some, on Sunday afternoon a
small, impromptu More Wine party broke out in the
VPI campsite. It then travelled to the Forks of Cheat
Winery booth for reinforcements. The resulting rips
to Steve Wells' jeans made for some good entertain-
ment, but some cavers were soon unable to attend
the awards ceremony. Those that did make it passed
out in their chairs and missed the event as well.
There weren't many cavers at the convention in Ida-
ho because of the travel distance. However the Zo
kaites family represented us well: every member
competed in the rope running sessions! Carol still
isn't certain how she got talked into that.
Sandy Knapp, Jerry Redder, and Carol Zokaites were
awarded NSS Fellowships during the convention. We
hoped Sandy would stop now, but she's still trying to
organize the club into a caver-event frenzy.
THE PRODIGAL CAVERS
As if seeing them only at big functions wasn't bad
enough, several out-of-town VPI cavers have come
back to Blacksburg to attend Virginia Tech (again).
Alison Williams, Ko Takamizawa, and more recently
Mark Eisenbees return in the pursuit of advanced de-
grees. (Of what – inebriation?)
Scott Rapier began the trend last year, returning to
chase down a B.S. in Horticulture. (We always knew
he was a bit off.) Philip Balister placed his employ-
ment with GE in limbo as he takes a crack at a mas-
ters level engineering degree.
Speaking of going back to school, Kirk Digby (after a
ten year lapse), Chris Rourke, and Chris “Guido”
Garguilo are all trying to finish up that pesky B.S. de-
gree. You wouldn't know it, though, based on the
number of evenings each week Guido spends at the
Ton....
In an interesting twist, Amanda Stiles left town to at-
tend school... in Germany. She signed on for a one-
year stint and will return to her parents' home in
NOVA when she gets back to the States. Ask Wells
about his recent visit.
BLACKSBURG CALLS
Cavers from all over are moving to Blacksburg in
droves. Bill Balfour has landed in Giles County sur-
rounded by newly discovered caves and many neigh-
borhood “dudes."
We think Mike and Andrea Futrell have moved into
the Bat Ranch, but it's hard to tell. Their stuff is there,
but the two have been in Borneo for the last couple
of months.
Ben and Corey Shwartz, cavers from BCOS, have
planted themselves (and two cats) in an apartment
close to downtown. Ben is working and going to
school while Corey searches for a permanent job.
Be careful! These people are slowly infiltrating the
club, possibly to steal club secrets.
Movin' ON UP (OR MAYBE JUST OVER)
Carol and Joe Zokaites moved to a huge house near
the Life Bible College in Christiansburg. The house
has a back porch extending the length of the house
and more rooms than they know what to do with.
They hosted the pre-Banquet party so they could
show off their new pad. They were astounded to dis-
cover that increasing your house size increases the
number of people who attend your parties. The real
question is, who got stuck with the jar of anal lube?
Sandy Knapp has moved into an apartment in
Blacksburg. She claims she loves living so close to
downtown, yet most Friday evenings her car is
parked outside the Ton. (She claims she comes
straight from work, but given her flexible schedule
it's highly suspicious.)
Jackie and Bob Hoell, in true caver fashion, plan to
live in separate states for the next year. Bob has ac-
cepted a tenure-track position in Georgia, while Jack-
ie will remain at George Washington University.
Plans after the first year are uncertain, but they have
a long way to go before beating Joan Johnson and Ko
