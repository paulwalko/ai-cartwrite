tally hosed down...water is still draining out of his
caving suit in a steady stream. By this time he's
worked his way over toward the ledge, and I see by
the look on his face we're both thinking the same
thing.
“There is no rope to the floor," I say as he gets off
rope shivering.
“Uh-huh."
“This is not good.” I reply. We're laughing a little, but
it's not funny.
“You have to fix it,” he said.
I knew that, thanks. I have no idea what he tied at the
top, why he came down the wrong rope, how many
bolts are there or anything. So I'm trying to get some
information, but Wells has become a blubbering idiot
at this point and can only stand there shivering.
“F-f-f-fix it,” he mutters.
“Well, what's going on up there?”
“F-f-f-fix it."
“What's tied off to what?” I prod.
“F-f-f-fix it.”
This conversation is useless. Now I just think to my-
self, “This is not good," instead of saying it. And the
solution to the problem is as hideous as it is obvious...
I need to climb up the 100/175 that Steve just rap-
pelled down and do what we'd originally planned: rig
the 190 at the top and bring the 100/175 back down
to the ledge, so we could then rappel to the floor. I
will get just as soaked as he did. I will be just as cold
as he is right now. What a lovely way to end my life.
I just stood there trying to think up some kind of
clever way out of this while Wells went to the tent to
strip off his soaking clothes and wring them out.
When he reappeared he still didn't appear in very
good shape. And he still didn't provide very many de-
tails about what the rigging and bolts currently looked
like at the top.
So I got all of the stuff he'd had previously clipped to
his harness and took it with me because I wasn't sure
if I might need to use the wrench to remove a hanger,
or what. I felt I needed everything just in case. After
I got all this stuff together, Wells was doing a little
better and explained that he'd placed a bolt right at
the top, but then drowned the drill in the waterfall
and it had stopped working. He'd gotten soaked in
the whole process, and the result was the 100/175
rope was rigged such that as you climbed, you pretty
much had to climb in the waterfall.
The last thing I did before leaving the ledge was dou-
ble check that Wells was actually clipped into some-
thing and wouldn't tumble off in my absence. Then I
had to do the same as Wells had done, rappelling
away from the ledge, then switching over and climb-
ing up the 100/175. Pretty much the moment I fin-
ished changing over, I swung out across the pit and
under the waterfall. Lovely.
Like a pendulum, I swung regularly back and forth
through the water. My hands were frozen almost im-
mediately. Each time the water hit me, I'd kick out to
the side. Between cleanings, I had just enough time to
take a breath and a step up. Except to make things
more interesting, the belay line had become twisted
around the line I was climbing and had so much fric-
tion, Wells couldn't pull it through. So each step up I
took, I had to pull that amount of rope through the
runners and feed it back down to the ledge. Take a
step, pull the rope, swing through the water, take a
step, pull the rope, swing through the water... over
and over. Near the top, things got even better. Be-
cause the belay line was twisted, it was running over
a bunch of muddy rock ledges on it's way up and back
down. Each time I pulled on the belay, a bunch of
rock crashed down on my head. “Thanks, Steve. I
love this! This is GREAT!” I'd call out, although I
doubt he could hear me.
I'm leaving something out. I wear glasses, and be-
tween the waterfall, the muddy rock beating me in the
head, and all the steam rising off of my body, visibility
was about 8 inches. And that was only when my pa-
thetic intermittent Petzl Mega felt like being on. My
carbide cap lamp... forget about it! So I climbed right
into the knot at the top before really even knowing I
was there.
And this is when it got fun. I couldn't see, couldn't
hear anything Wells said, if he did try to say anything,
and couldn't feel anything below my elbow. Even
though I was probably thinking clearly, I was think-
ing, “What if I'm not thinking clearly?" Ugh. Anyway,
I got my upper body out of the water and discovered
that there were three bolts traversing across the top
of the dome, the last of which was in the waterfall,
and that's the one everything was currently tied into.
My goal in the end was to rig a butterfly into the bolt
farthest from the waterfall to make future ascents a
little dryer, and then put a second butterfly in the sec-
ond closest bolt, and lastly to remove all the crap
from the bolt in the waterfall and rappel back down.
I'd like to detail more of exactly what I did here, but
I can't really remember. I was super cold and my
