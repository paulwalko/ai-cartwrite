Expedition to the Caves of Gold
by Carl Bern
Jim Wilson mentioned the trip to Spanish at the very
first Colorado Grotto meeting I attended. The area
intrigued me immediately. Jim described the caves as
wet, 33°F, with plenty of ropework and exposed
climbs. What makes the trip a true expedition experi-
ence is the fact that one must backpack into the area
and camp to access the caves. I chatted with Jim dur-
ing the break between the program and business por-
tions of the meeting and decided that I had to join
this year's trip.
That was in February. This August I found myself
cursing in Thursday morning rush-hour traffic on In-
terstate 25 in Denyer. I had a backpack crammed
with gear and a sack lunch in the back seat and only
ten minutes to get to the other side of town. When I
arrived at Skip Withrow's house half an hour late I
apologized profusely. Not all cavers run on caver
time. Even Dan Sadler, who had worked until four
that morning, had arrived on schedule. I chucked my
gear in Skip's Truck and the four of us were off.
Three hours later we pulled into a dirt parking lot
where we met Dennis Laird. Dennis was the only per-
son in the group with whom I had been caving be-
fore. From there we drove up an extremely rough dirt
road to the trailhead. Here we ate our lunch and then
saddled ourselves with our gigantic backpacks. We
spent all of a quarter mile hiking on an established
trail. Then Jim led us onto a hunter path that led
steeply up a ridge. We followed this path for over an
hour until we reached one of Jim's landmarks and
turned into the trackless woods. A little over an hour
of bushwhacking brought us to our camp. It was lo
cated just below treeline at 11,000 feet. We set up our
tents on level spots carved into the slope. It began to
rain an hour after we arrived. The rain was quickly
followed by intense hail. Such is life in the big moun-
tains.
I was awakened the next morning by the chatter of
the alarm squirrel. Jim wamed me that it went off ev-
ery morning at six. While I was there that little bugger
was never off by more than a minute or two. We ate,
packed gear, and headed up the hill. The hike is a
steep one and the altitude adds to the challenge. A
brief stop to check out the lower entrance of Spanish
gave us a break. This was where we would exit the
cave at the end of our through trip. The start of the
trip was still well above us so we resumed our climb.
At last we arrived at the upper entrance. There we ad-
mired the view into the Wet Mountain Valley as our
sweat dried in the bright sun. Suddenly we saw a fig-
ure with a pack down at treeline. It was Pat Malone.
She had camped at the trailhead and then made the
long hike in that moming. Less than an hour after we
spotted her she was with us at the entrance, ready for
the strenuous Spanish through trip. Pat is great; she
would never admit to being tough and yet she does
things like that.
Our first objective for the day was to smoke trace the
Sucking Tube, an impassable entrance located close
to upper Spanish. To that end we decided on posi-
tions that people would take in the cave. We would
look for smoke while Jim and Skip set off two smoke
bombs in the Sucking Tube. I was chosen to obserye
while on rope, thirty feet down 140 foot deep Frank's
Pit.
We suited up for the trip. Spanish Cave is about 33°F
and drippy. I wore my coveralls from B&C Wunder-
wear over pants and a shirt made of 300 weight
fleece. I also had polypro bottoms on and carried a
polypro shirt and a balaclava in my pack. For my
hands I had waterproof chemical gloves over liners;
these were a godsend. All this gear was for a trip on
which we would be moving fairly quickly. The sun
seemed a lot hotter once we were dressed for winter.
One by one, everyone except Jim and Skip wriggled
into the tight upper entrance to Spanish Cave.
Almost immediately we came to a dicey climbdown.
This was the site of an accident in 1992. Jim took a
fall while headed into the cave. It broke his hand and
peeled back a little bit of his scalp. Everyone made it
down safe this year thanks to Dennis who pointed
out a secret foothold.
Not far past the climbdown is the top of Frank's Pit.
Dennis and Dan rappelled to the bottom of the pit
and then I took my assigned position thirty feet
down. There was a bridge of rock across the pit at this
level and I was able to stand on it while remaining on
rope. Shouts were relayed to the entrance and the
smoke bombs were lit. Between five and ten minutes
later I spotted smoke slowly filtering out of a lead
high in the pit. It would require at least one bolt for a
person to reach it safely from the bridge. I made note
of its location and rappelled off the bridge as the stink
of sulfur got stronger. Below the bridge the room
