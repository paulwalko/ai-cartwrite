Cave Club Trends
by Katherine Shelor
In the Fall semester of 1999, Lawrence Britt posted
an interesting email to the listserve. It included the
Roll Book Record documenting all of VPI Cave Club
members from the beginning. From 1968 on, the
dates of membership were included. It has been said
that membership is cyclic. I wanted to see the trend
for myself, so I produced the following graphs.
The first graph is simply a bar graph of the number
of memberships granted per year. This graph seemed
to have a declining average. To analyze this assump-
tion, the second graph was constructed. This shows
one line of the memberships per year, and a second
line (dotted) showing the average for each five years.
As you can see, membership is declining to almost as
low as 1976 membership! We need to see numbers
like 1969, 1970 and 1983.
Note: The first recorded VPI # and membership date
was 103, so before 1968, the average memberships
per year appear to be 8.5.
