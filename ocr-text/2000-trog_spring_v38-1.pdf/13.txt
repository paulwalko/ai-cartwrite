Takamizawa's marital distance record.
Matt Seigler and Erica Freiberger have recently pur-
chased a home in Pittsburgh. This is sad news for
those who'd hoped they would finally tire of that
state and return to Virginia.
Kirk Digby heads to NOVA for the summer on an
internship. Despite the four hour drive, it won't be
surprising to find him at Ton on many Friday nights.
Joe Thompson is now working a “one month on, one
month off" job in Pennsylvania. He keeps his apart-
ment in Blacksburg and “drops by" when he gets the
chance. Rumor has it the job is at a nuclear power
plant. Be afraid. Be very afraid.
Laine Buckwalter is now fully employed by a fiber
optics and electronics company in Radford. Despite
the company's secrecy during the interview and offer,
she is pleased with her job.

The power line hearing begins on May 1, so those
able to head to Richmond for the day should show up
to oppose the line through Skydusky Hollow.
DANGEROUS HABITS
And we thought caying was dangerous! One of
cavers' other favorite hobbies has led to the births of
two new caver babies. Adam and Tracey Hungerford
introduced Seth John on September 29, 1999, and
Paul Kirchman and Dabney Hammer came next with
Marina Skye on December 2. Patti Kitchin and Mark
Leach will soon add a third to their kid collection.
Molly Lucier and Mike Newsome expect a stork de-
livery any day now! (We're saving space here in case
Molly manages to give birth before this goes to
press.)
HOW IT ALL BEGINS
After secretly living together for over a year, then
buying a house together, Dave Colatosti and Patricia
Feely have decided they may as well get married.
Dave's mom made sure there was an engagement
ring to make it official. Don't get too excited, though;
the wedding is set for “some time in the future.”
Kristin Posson managed to land one, herself. She and
her finance Dan Somebody have just moved into an
apartment together in the DC area.
Judy Yienger (of trampoline fame) plans to wed this
June 10th to Ken Brownsburger. He's already
whisked her away to a house in the mountains of
Boulder, Colorado
Allison Hedricks will marry her high school sweet-
heart on the same day in June. The small wedding will
take place at mom Joan Redder's house, which gave
Joan a good reason to inform Jerry that they're get-
ting the whole house repainted. Jerry claims the
house fix-up will cost more than the wedding and pri-
vate reception.
OTHER OUTLETS
Dave Colatosti, the club thespian, continues his side
career of local actor. This year he's been slinking
around stage in The Importance of Being E mest (as Emest
himself), Ārseric and âd Lace, and The Prisoner of Zenda.
More plays on in the works.

TALES OF A BASTARD
“Mr. Mom” Orndorff has accepted a job with the
Department of Conservation and Recreation after an
agonizing many months of suspense. Poor Wil; now
he gets paid to traipse around in sinkholes and inves-
tigate caves.
He has also been key to the AEP power line struggle.
Local residents pooled their money and hired Wil to
analyze the impact of the power line in their area with
respect to caves, cave life, and the watershed. He
spent many hours dye tracing, bat counting, and ridge
walking in Bland County, resulting in the discovery of
new and promising caves. Many VPI cavers donated
their time to the cause, but none more than Joe Th-
ompson. Ask Joe and Wil about the stained clothing,
smashed fences, and other adventures.
