balance while making the move. It was a hanger on a
bolt used to rig the pit. I looped a finger through the
hanger, prayed that I would not slip, and stretched
out my foot to the ledge. Pat saw that I had not fallen
or dislocated my finger and so she came across the
same way. We found another bolt on the other side
and rigged my webbing as a handline. Soon Jim, Dan,
Dennis and Skip arrived at the pit. They were also
surprised by the absence of the snowbank. With the
handline, though, everyone made it across the
traverse without incident.
We made our way through the windy crawl and out
into the daylight. The through-trip had taken about
six hours. The skies were gray and told us that the af-
ternoon thunderstorms were on their way. Everyone
hustled down the mountain and made it to the tents
before the rain started.
We built a fire that night. As everyone stood close to
feel its warmth Jim told us more about the legends of
Spanish Cave. Many years ago stories began to circu-
late in the small towns in the Wet Mountain Valley.
The stories claimed that the conquistadors mined
Spanish Cave for gold. They used Native Americans
as slaves in the mine and one could still find the skel-
eton of such a slave chained to the wall in the cave.
No evidence has ever been found to substantiate
these stories. Then sometime in the 1970's a newspa-
per reporter tried to encourage local people to com-
mercialize the cave. He showed them some
photographs he had taken in Spanish. The photos
showed water droplets on the ceiling of a room. The
way the droplets reflected the light of the flash made
them gleam like gold. A town meeting was held and
some cavers made an appearance to head off any ef-
forts to commercialize the cave. They explained that
Spanish is cold, wet, dangerous, and inconveniently
located halfway up a mountain. They also swore that
they had found no gold or evidence of conquistadors
in the cave. The commercialization idea was scrapped
fairly quickly after that.
Treasure hunters still come to the cave looking for
the Spanish gold. Most are not prepared for the con-
ditions they encounter and so do not go deep in the
cave. Sometimes, though, they hang around on the
surface scouring the ground with metal detectors. In
an example of true caver humor someone suggested
dropping a couple of pennies into catholes as we dug
them around camp. That would give the treasure
hunters something to find.
We did more caving over the next two days. On Sat-
urday Dennis, Dan, Pat, and I went to the very back
of a cave called White Marble Halls. Jim and Skip
were at a dig in a nearby cave called Davis Sink We
waited patiently and watched for smoke from the
bombs they set off in Davis Sink. Twenty minutes af-
ter the appointed time we spotted smoke coming
from a fissure in bedrock. The fissure narrowed to at
least four inches. This was a disappointment because
nothing short of full scale mining will connect the
two caves any time soon. After the smoke trace we
surveyed in an area called the Queen's Chamber. The
survey took us on a climb up a beautiful white flow-
stone slope. After we had finished our work we
pulled down the rope on the climb. It had been left
by a previous year's expedition and seemed to be en-
couraging traffic on the slope.
On Sunday Dennis, Dan, Pat, and I went caving to-
gether again. Jim and Skip were occupied mapping a
small cave nearby. Our job was to change out the reg-
ister in Lower Spanish. We must have been acclima-
tizing because the trudge up the hill seemed a lot
easier this day. Soon we were back at the nameless pit
we had traversed on the through trip. Dennis rigged
the first drop. I rappelled down first and dragged a
tangle of rope all the way down the 140 foot slope. I
was still on rope when I reached the top of the next
drop, which is called The Jug. The natural anchor for
The Jug forces the rope to hang in a tight fissure. Af-
ter tying off to this giant boulder and clipping in I
spotted a crack further out over the pit. It bristled
with pitons from various eras. I picked a solid looking
one and used it to redirect the rope. The Jug was a
nice 90 foot rappel against a smooth wall. We fulfilled
our responsibility by changing out the register in the
bottom of the pit. Except for a group that visited two
weeks previously, no one had signed in since a survey
team in 1996. The pit, however, still contains ample
evidence of the presence of man. Piles of laid rope,
rotten wood, and other historical debris testify to the
visits of explorers in the past.
We set off to explore Lower Spanish. We found the
Gold Diggings. This is a spot in the bottom of the
cave where someone went looking for his own partic-
ular type of gold: virgin cave. Dan followed the tun-
nel to its end. He reported that it blew no air, but the
earth was soft and easy to dig. From the Gold Dig-
gings we made our way to the waterfall. The passage
to the waterfall is a tight and muddy tube with some
slick chimneys. I felt like I had been transported back
east. The Colorado cavers struggled. All the dry caves
in the state had not prepared them for good clay mud.
We found the waterfall, a nice fifteen foot cascade.
Dan shocked us all by pulling out an expensive Gore-
