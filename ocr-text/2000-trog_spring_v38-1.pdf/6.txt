Hoo-Ab Murder Hole! Wait a minute - This is Clover Hollow!
by Beth Geiger
It was a dark and stormy night, the air was deathly still
and the sky was black. Well actually it wasn't but it
could have been. I was in the process of building a
frog climbing system and was very anxious for a good
vertical trip. It was Friday night so I went to the club
meeting where a trip was planned for Murder Hole
on Saturday. The trip members were to be Kirk Dig-
by, Ray Sira and Dave Colatosti. Also going on the
trip were three new trainees who had not yet been
vertical caving. After instructing the new trainees on
what to buy for the next day's trip (knots and web-
bing) we agreed on a time and a place to meet in the
morning. Meanwhile Dave C was busy changing his
mind about going on our trip and trying to get on
Steve and Steve's DMCtrip (which he didn't go on ei-
ther). That night at the Speleo-Seminar the three new
trainees showed up with their knots and participated
in the first ever (and last) “Beth’s vertical session"
where they cut their knots to the appropriate length.
(Why I was even involved in that is beyond me). Any-
way, after a pretty good speleo sem, I decided that
since I had not actually yet built my frog but only just
had the pieces, I should go do some work. So after
saying goodbye to everyone, including Sandy Ramsey
who really wanted me to go look at the stars or some
thing with her even though she knows I'm not that
way, I drove back to the house with Kirk, who also
happens to be my roommate, to work on my vertical
gear. Not long after we got back, Joe Thompson
showed up to help. So never mind the fact that I
didn't fully understand the mechanics of the climbing
system I was building, I had Kirk and Joe to help me.
Soon enough though, both Kirk and Joe passed out
on the couch. Whenever I had a question or a con-
cern I had to wake one up and listen to a bunch of
crap just to get a yes or no. Every now and then Kirk
would regain consciousness and check what I was do-
ing so I of course felt very confident in my work. By
urce felt very confident in my work By
this time it was getting pretty early in the moming and
we were scheduled to pick the three new.trainees up
at some ridiculous hour like 9 or something.
After a very restful 4 hours of sleep, I reluctantly got
up and woke Kirk to go get the new trainees. Mean-
while, I gathered up my gear and prepared for my
long awaited trip to Murder Hole. Finally after screw
ing around at the house for about an hour, we were
signed out and ready to go meet Ray.
Soon we were on our way to Murder Hole, which is
maybe an hour away. It was a rather pleasant day so
it could have been a really nice drive- except Kirk was
in the car. By the time we were halfway to the cave I
was ready to KILL Kirk. I don't think it is possible
for anyone to be more annoying than he was that da
Eventually, though we all (even Kirk) made it to the
Sizer's' (owners of Murder Hole) where we went up
to the house to ask permission to cave that day. Weil
after milling around the place for a bit and knocking
on the door quite a few times we realized that no one
was home and we would have to take our cave trip
elsewhere. It was decided that we would drive back to
Ray's and from there we would construct a Plan B.
Everyone agreed that the day should definitely not be
wasted, so instead of Murder Hole we would have
our fun in Clover Hollow (oh joy). We called back to
town and got Steve Wells to change our sign out to
Clover Hollow and once again set out for a cave trip.
Well it was a nice trip but lasted ten hours (could
these trainees possibly climb ANY slower). We went
down to the Gypsum flowers - which I of course had
to go down and see again (they are just too beautiful
to pass by). Then we laughed when one of the train-
ees Jason Obenschain spent almost ten minutes look-
ing for the flowers and still didn't see them. Soon we
were on our way out of the cave. The Canyon Section
was double rigged so I climbed first with Ray and
then waited at the top for the rest.
Kirk stayed at the bottom to check everyone's knots.
When Kirk finally got on rope and started climbing,
he was climbing next to the trainee Jason. However,
when he reached almost the top of the canyon, he
dropped his carbide light and had to do a changeover
and go back down and get it. Then as he was ascend-
ing again, he got about part way up the rope and
dropped his carbide light AGAIN. What was really
funny is that after all that screwing around, he still got
to the top of the canyon before Jason.
I suppose it was about this time that Kirk became in-
capacitated due to the overwhelming pain of a tooth-
ache he had been dealing with for about a week. Soon
it was clear that my status on the trip as the “trainee
with a clue” was going to be put to the test. I was
deemed de-rigging trainee and helped get the others
on rope at the flowstone nuisance drop and got them
off-rope at the next drop. It was also around this time
that it was decided that I really suck at coiling rope
