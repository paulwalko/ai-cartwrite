A Midnight Summer's Dreamlike Occurrence
by Steve LePera
Referring to anything we've ever done as a “Dream-
like Occurrence” probably paints our behavior using
rose colored glasses, or at the very least beer goggles,
but that's what storytelling is all about anyway. So you
may feel free to substitute Hypothermic Stupor at any
time in place of Dreamlike.
MegaDome is a 222.6 foot (67.8 meter) dome which
was, briefly, the deepest free rappel in Virginia. The
dome didn't collapse or anything, but the record was
shattered nevertheless after a mere four hours when
another much deeper drop was recorded in a differ-
ent southwest Virginia cave.
Anyway, here's one of about a million adventures I
n adventures I
could have written about the 76 bolt, five trip journey
to the top of MegaDome, most of which involve
somebody (usually named Steve) doing something
stupid and surviving anyway. This version isn't likely
to be as exciting or awe-inspiring as hearing Wells
babble it out over the course of a dozen beers or so
around 4 am at OTR, but we've all already heard that
version anyway. In contrast, you may consider the
following to be God's Honest Truth.
Doe Mountain Cave (37.1575 N, 80.4668 W but
don't tell anyone because it's top secret, and Balfour
doesn't want to have to kill anyone), is lazily called
To
DMC by us cool cayers (and not to be confused with
De-Militarized Cave, near Hanoi). My first trip was in
mid-June, 1999, and we rigged and rappelled a virgin
174 foot pit. The cave is best characterized by just
saying "vertical.” A trip into the beginning of the
MegaDome survey requires 25, 10, and 30 foot nui-
sance drops, two 160+ consecutive rappels, and a lot
of crawling. The goal on every trip we've taken has
been to connect the currently surveyed part of DMC
to a second entrance. The connection by dye trace
was made in fifteen minutes, but there is 600 feet ver-
tically from the bottom of MegaDome to the surface.
There is only 300 feet horizontal distance.
On three of the four previous bolting trips, Wells and
myself used, in order of appearance, Chris Hibsh-
man, Eric Stanley, and Joe Thompson to haul a
bunch of extra stuff into the dome. Without their
help we would have a lot less gear stranded in the
cave now awaiting removal. Despite how fun the pre-
vious trips had been, none of these fellows were in-
terested in coming back with us on our fifth, and
what turned out to be final, bolting trip. So it was
Steve and Steve, a couple of Wades chicken liver din-
ners, a vial of Truckers Stay-Awake and ibuprofen,
and a couple of 30 pound packs going for it all alone.
The final push to reach the top of MegaDome began
with high hopes. On the previous trip, when Wells
was coming back down the rope cleaning up gear,
he'd apparently dislodged a large piece of the wall and
called “Rock!” Due to the echo, and possibly due to
my eardrums being frozen solid, I didn't catch what
he said and replied, “What?” Wells replies, “I said
ROCK!"...then there is a big kaboom from down the
pit when the rock hit. Quite the delay there! We both
knew the dome was getting pretty high.
So we were pretty excited about maybe getting to the
top this time. We entered the cave about 7pm Friday
night, and arrived at the bottom of MegaDome in less
than 4 hours. We didn't waste any time heading up
the first rope to our “camp”, a ledge about 120 feet
off the floor of the pit. We'd reached the ledge on the
third trip and moved our belay up to that point from
then on. At the bottom of the pit the belayer got
soaked and froze in a howling wind, so the ledge was
comparatively dry and warm. Joe Thompson had also
hauled in a tent-shaped plastic tarp on the previous
trip, and Wells and I had set that up to hide in when
we were eating or resting.

Wells and I were goofy as could be already. I don't
know if it was the late hour or whatever, but we were
having a good time and laughing it up like a couple of
idiots. I should have seen the obvious: things were
going to go downhill.
I can't tell much more without explaining the mess of
