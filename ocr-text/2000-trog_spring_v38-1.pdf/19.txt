ropes already in place from the previous trips. There
were now three ropes in the pit. The rope from the
floor to the ledge was a 175 footer. We were using a
100 foot rope to “clean” the wall as we climbed, and
using a 190 footer to belay the climber. As we geared
up on the ledge now, the 190 was in a pile behind us
and the 100 was running up and out around the cor-
ner, rigged to the last bolts we'd set on the previous
trip, probably 50 or 60 feet above the ledge. All of
these were tangled behind us in a ball of knots, pre-
sumably securely tied into two bolts. The ledge is re-
cessed, so as you go up the climber disappears around
a comer after about 20 feet and can no longer be
seen, or heard either, actually.
Wells and I pulled all our gear out onto the floor and
began the pre-climb preparations. I've seen it, and
even I can't believe how much junk has been carried
up to this point. But despite the appearances of total
disorganization, everything required to do the climb
turned out to be present and accounted for. On pre-
vious trips we were actually getting progressively
LESS prepared each time, leaving behind: my rack,
my pack straps, then Wells pack straps, the fifi hook,
and a dump bottle. So we complimented each other
on not leaving anything behind this time, then looked
around for some wood to knock on.
Failing to find wood suitable for knocking, we started
"assembling" bolts. Each bolt got a hanger, mallion,
and nut to hold it all together, and then got clipped
into a runner (two carabiners connected by a 3-4 inch
length of webbing) for the belay line. These pre-as-
sembled bolt/hanger/mallion units are hammered
into the wall directly and minimize (note: minimize
does not mean eliminate the possibility of dropping
some important component down the pit.
After preassembling everything, we clipped all the
crap onto Wells harness and shoved him out into the
pit. Since the 100 came down from above and looped
back up to our ledge, Wells rappelled a little bit then
changed over and climbed out around the corner and
disappeared. He wasn't really on belay, but the belay
line was already clipped into his harness, and I fed it
out gradually as he ascended. Once he reached the
top of the rope, where we'd left off previously, he
clipped himself directly into the bolts, clipped the
first runners into the bolts, then clipped the belay line
through the runners, effectively putting himself on
belay. Then he derigged the 100 and clipped it into
the back of his harness. Time to start bolting!
The basic idea with a bolt ladder is to reach as high
above your head as you can and place a hole with the
hammer drill. You then tap the bolt assembly into
that hole and tighten it down. Next, an etrier (pro-
nounced a-tree-a) which is a webbing ladder, and a
runner holding the belay line are clipped into the mal-
lion. You can climb up the etrier until you're able to
snag yourself by the fifi hook (small thing like what
Captain Hook had on the end of his arm, except we
nig ours on our seat harness) into the hanger or mal-
lion itself. Then you reach above your head again and
place another bolt. It sounds pretty simple, and if you
were climbing a flat, dry, solid piece of limestone, it
would probably take five minutes a hole to drill and
set each bolt, and then climb up to the next level. But
it winds up taking an average of about 10-15 minutes
for each placement. The tangle of webbing, rope, car-
abiners, drills, wrenches, ice-cube trays, and normal
vertical gear all snag on each other and anything else
nearby larger than 1/4 inch, and generally slow every-
thing down. Sometimes you can climb on handholds
or ledges above and beyond the last bolt placement
and get a “Wells” step up the wall. Of course, some-
times the handholds or ledges are crap and you take
a fun ole’ factor 2 fall... that's when you wind up bare-
lyeven reaching over your head to place the next one.
On average you wind up taking 3-4 foot increments
up the wall. If you need to traverse to the side, that
just slows you down even more. I made Wells do all
the traversing because it was much harder than going
up.
The thing about belaying something like this is, who
knows what's going on up there? You can't see or
hear much. Every few moments there is some kind of
gear clanking about, or the belay line tugs, or some.
rock comes whizzing down the pit. So I begin to day-
dream about the 100x100 booming borehole we'll
find at the top. Like the ocean, water rushing down
the drop blends all these noises harmoniously togeth-
er. It's very relaxing, and combined with a lowered
core body temperature, I begin to believe I am at a
very cold beach, and should possibly put something
on over my bathing suit. But the women are so beau-
tiful, who would want to leave? I believe that one may
be looking at me, and she...
RRRRR-PAP-PAP-PAP-PAP-PAP-PAP! Wells is
drilling another hole in the wall. I am cold, but the be-
lay line is still tight and I haven't fallen off the ledge.
All is good. Then the drilling is done, and there is
some clanking. It really does echo a lot. I am thinking
about how big the pit must be for such a great echo.
Let's see, how many bolts have we set... at this point
just over 60. I bet we average at least two feet per
bolt, even including traverses... that would be a 120
