was laid out. Another group of experienced cavers
played around in Newberry's, and a two-person trip
dashed from the Baines entrance to Bill's Rappel and
zipped up the rope before the trainee trip made it up
the Devil's Staircase.
The bonfire was especially nice given the chilly con-
ditions, and spirits were high. So high, in fact, that
the club rolled five kegs down the hill before Sunday
moming
Thanks go to Beth Geiger and the other picnic orga-
nizers, and to Mandie Aldrich for having the new
club t-shirts ready for distribution at Picnic.
ROPE RUNNING
Rumor has it the rope running sessions will be in full
force soon at Wil and Zenah Omdorff's place. Just as
well, because Carl Bern and Amy Johnson plan to at-
tend the 2000 Convention and think their new Colo-
rado friends can out-medley VPI. Dig out your moldy
systems and let's get motivated!
BAT HUMOR (VERY BAD).
A vampire bat came flapping in from the night covered in fresh blood and parked himself on the roof of the
cave to get some sleep. Pretty soon all the other bats smelled the blood and began hassling him about where
he got it. He told them to leave him alone and let him get some sleep, but they persisted until finally he gave in.
“Okay, okay. Do you see that tree out there?" he asked, pointing through the mouth of the cave.
“Yes, yes, yes!" the bats all screamed in a frenzy.
“Good,” said the first bat, “because I didn't!"
