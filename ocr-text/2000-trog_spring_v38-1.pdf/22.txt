hands were like stumps, so tying knots was horrible.
Untying the existing knots, which had already been
weighted, was totally impossible. I had to keep un-
screwing mallions to move knots from one place to
another. I kept thinking, “Don't drop the rope down
the pit or we are stuck here until the body recovery.”
Then I'd think, “What are you clipped into?” Some-
times I think I had the end of the rope clipped into
my harness about three times I was so paranoid, but
so many things had to be moved and tied and clipped
that I really had no idea. I suspect that a video of this
whole business would be truly horrifying to my
mother. “You are no longer my son,” she would cry!
Fortunately, it all got “fixed” as Wells had requested,
and I rappelled safely back down to the ledge. He was
in a lot better spirits than I was, and so began laugh-
ing as soon as I arrived. I was soaked like I crawled
up out of a swamp. Wells pointed out that my Mega
lamp head was filled up 2/3 of the way with water.
Perhaps that explains some of the intermittent oper-
ation; I don't know.
I pretty much put my trust in Wells every trip to get
me out of situations like this, and he got all our gear
together while I tried to dry out and warm up. We
were both slap-happy and tired and cold, and we
couldn't stop laughing. Everything along the way out
was hysterical, including our decision to turn the exit
into a “sport trip.”
Instead of going out the normal way, we took the al-
temate “wet" way, which we'd never tried. What the
hell... we were already soaked!
So we left the cave and lived happily ever after.
