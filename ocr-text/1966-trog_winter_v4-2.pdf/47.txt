I must be standing in the way. See,"

After close scrutiny of the formations, the good doctor decided to
save his flashbulbs and return to the surface. We all joined him and
left the cave about nightfall.

HOSTERMAN'S PIT
Centre County, Pennsylvania
Pan.
Personnel: Charlie Maus, Pete Tryon, Maddy Tryon,
On our way to Mammoth Cave, Charlie and I just couldn't resist the
temptation of stopping off in State College (500 miles out of the way)
and visiting the famed and fabled Hosterman's Pit.
After a short bit of rest at Pete and Maddy's, the four of us headed
for Nevin Davis' home to pick up the key and sign the release form. The
subsoil rights to the property on which the cave is located are owned by
Bethlehem Steel. A very close working arrangement between the Nittany
Grotto and Bethlehem Steel has resulted in an elaborate, locked manhole
type entrance drop, plus a very "clean", unvandalized cave.
After rigging the drop, we rappelled on down and explored and poked
around in the better part of the mile of known passage. As Lew Bicking
has said of Hosterman's: "It is a West Virginia cave that got lost.".
Meter for meter, this is one of the best decorated caves I have ever been
in. A series of pits, climbs, traverses, and chimneys follow such inter-
esting sections as Nevin's. Heaven, The Pipe Pit, Carol's Section, the
Crystal Section, and the Loop. Another short rappel is encountered in
the cave if one is to keep from retracing his steps.
Not wishing to prusik, I proved that the entrance pit can almost"
be climbed. Soon all of us were on the surface, thinking of the warm
food and cool suds awaiting us at Pete's.
