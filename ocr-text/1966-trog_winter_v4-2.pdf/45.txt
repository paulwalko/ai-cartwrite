We left the VPI Campus about 10 a.m., the time we had decided upon to
meet Gordon, Tom, and John at tho cave. We finally arrived at the appointed
place about 10:45, only to find that we couldn't enter the cave yet be-
cause Mr. Sizer was not at home. To kill time, we made a quick trip over
to Walk-Through Cave (See Tech Troglodyte, Vol. III, No. 4, pagë 132),.
After a quick walk through the cave, we went back to Mr. Sizer's house
He was not at home yet, but was expected any minute, so we decided to wait.
After a short wait, Mr. Sizer, one of the youngest. cave owners I know,
came roaring up in his red Thunderbird and immediately gave us permission
to go into his cave. We all signed the register and headed on up to the
pit.
Aftor testing the ropes, several of us walked up to the top of the
hill above the hole for a view of Newcastle and the James River Valley..
The Sinking Creek Anticline could be clearly seen stretching cway to the
west, and plunging to the east. The entire valley, only a mile and a half
wide at this point, is bound on the south by Sinking Creek Mountain, which
curves around to form John's Creek Mountain...
:
Sinking Creek, flowing about 30 miles to the New River, probably used
to rise at the point. Today, Meadow Creek has pirated several miles of
the valley and drains through a deep, narrow gap at the head of the valley,
descending to the basin below over a series of cascades known as Butter-
milk Falls. This stream piracy has created a drainage divide in the valley
of rolling Beekmantown limestone hills containing a number of caves, some :
of particular, interest, Rufe Caldwell!s Cave is the largest in Craig
County, having 3000 feet of mostly largo, rectangular corridors. “Fish .....
Hatchery Cave, now flooded by a concrete dam, conjecturally drains both :
the south side of the valley and the runoff from Sinking Creek Mountain,
which disappears in several sinks a mile or more west of the cave. Ai
small hydraulic ram pumps water to part of the fish hatchery.
On the north side of the valley is Meadow Creek, which sinks and -
flows underground for about a half a mile. Unfortunately, the only cave
entrances in that vicinity lead to very short caves. One of the real
* mysteries of this area is a large cave entrance at the head of Meadow
Creek, known as Two-Mile Cave. It has only been visited once and is re-
ported as being two miles long, the outer half mile being a rubble crawl.
The owner closed the cave the next day because his drinking water became
muddy. That was 20 years ago. No one has been in it since. (Copy Ed,
note: The owner also claims that rocks taken out of the cave disappear,
