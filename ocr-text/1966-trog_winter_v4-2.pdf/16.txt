My intelligent conversation with a very nice lody in the
Security Office soon deterioratod into an entangling attempt
to describe our situation. I don't really blancher for not
knowing what a siphon was. (Higher educational institutions
in Charlottesville have probably not concorned therselves with
the teaching of such useful. dofinitions.). She attempted to
write down the detrils and anparently planned to contact the
leavers on the U.Va. compus.
We were obviously wasting valurhle time and in order to
avoid turning confusion into chaos, (this would have been the
end result if she would have attempted to repeat the information
I had given her.) I asked her to let me talk to Mason Sproul.
This would elimingte Ã¤n obviously non-essential and confusing
link in communications.
11. (Finally) Mason Sproul, U.Ve.--I explained briefly what had
happened and Mason agreed to meet us at the cave about 8pm. It'
had been a long time since Mason had been in Staircase (chuckle),
so I had to give him directions on how to reach the cave.
(Gary had a topo, map with Snedegars plotted.)
12.
Bill Karras, NCG--no answer at first.
Bill was finally contacted in the evening by Byron McCutchen.
It is not necessary to say any more about the 'Uva Security'
Office .except that it is an unfortunate, but sometimes necessary,
link in communications. Recent mass distribution of Ninson Sproul's
propaganda sheets has helped to straighten out most of the details
about the C.R.C.N.
1. The C.R.C.N. may not be the best answor but at least it
is a step in the right direction. '. There is no magic formula
for cave rescue: organization. If there was one, Bill Plummer
Woulf! Have alrody derived it. Bill Karras seems to have an
answer for everything but the solution to nothing. As long as
both of these people just sit around and think and don't go
caving the C.R.C.N. will have a peaceful year. If they ever
decide to go caving togethor, please call the VPI Grotto More
Discreet, Most Successful Ceve Rescue Team.
