Most of this tripe is so ridiculous that it is impossible to poke fun
at. However, we would like to point out that the arrow will not "point
forward, to the cave's ontrance" while HURT members are ontering the cave.
Unless, of course, they entered backwards; and, in view of the above :
"Explanation ...", this procedure seems somewhat lopical. "Je might also add
that the "lost. caver', has only to lock around to "see the way out" with
his light; a lost caver's problem is that, althourh ho can see passages
leading out, as Ions as he has light, he has no inca which passage to take.
How's that for "speed anil quick thinking?"
Which leads us to conclude that The Underground is right--in story,
song, and poem, no less-- about Honcio. Why, oven John Cooper, the sage of
feudists, never made a Grotto or individual look as ridiculous as Hondo
has done all by itself.
But don't feel blue, Hondo, just becauso you marle somobody see red lue to
your kindergarden-level journalism. You still have Bill Karras.

WANTED:
INTELLIGENT CAVE OWNERS.
The first of these "Wanted" articles appeared last spring in Vol. III,
No. 3, p.82, of this journal and was entitled 'l'Wanted: A Little. Cooperation."
In it, the author, Dave Strope, made Ã  desperate appeal for all cavers to
appease cave owners, rogardless of how unreasonable they may seem at the
time. (I.quote, "...We must bend over backwards to convince them they are
righteorie Cooperation, no matter how one-sided.....may even open up scme
caves for us." I further quote, ".... blame cannot be placed on the shoulders
of the cave cwner.") The general cpinion of this writer is that the article
showed a good understanding of the problems that arise with cave owners, and
that Mr. Strope advanced his plea for better relations in a manner fitting
the circumstances. However, this strongly conservaticn-oriented article
has since fallen under heavy criticism by, of all persons, our conservation
chairman, Ed Bauer. Obviously Mr. Bauer misinterpreted the article. The
point most sharply criticized by Bauer was that, scmehow, Mr; Strope managed
to insert an adjective or two that, when closely. scrutinized, may somehow
be interpreted to intimate that perhaps an occasional cave owner is not in-
fallible (i.e. .... "stubborn" ...i. Mirnorant" ....etc.. Ed Bauer's
rebuttal appeared in Vol. IV, No.1, if anyone cares to read it.
It is my personal opinion that they are both wrong, but to varying cle-
grees. Mr. Strope was on the right track, but he euphemized his true
feelings, I believe, too much. On the cther hand, Mr. Bauer has a down-
right unhealthy attitude toward cave owners. He seems to think that just
because a man happens to own a farm with a worthless hole on it, we must
kiss his toenails everytime we pass his decr. This is indeed a negative
