Bob and I spent the night sleeping under an automatic car-wash after
being swept from our camping spot on a nearby mountain by a violent thun-
derstorm. The morning dawned clear and, after breakfast at the hotel, we
grouped up and headed south. Bob, George Wheelchair" Titcomb, John
Schellling, and others headed for extensive Ewing Saltpeter Cave, Keith
Evans, Roger Baroody and the others from U.Va. were beat from an extensive
trip into Gilley's the day before, so they fooled around with some leads
and did some surface work.
Holsinger, Finley, Milligan and I teamed up with Stan Carts, Steve
Logan (PSC), and Jerry Fredrick (D.C.) setting forth for Surgener's Cave.
After squeezing all of Stan's rolls into a dry suit, we followed an aban-
doned path several thousand feet downhill through scrub cedar-covered
karst and eventually found ourselves above the entrance to the cave. A
rain-swollen stream emerged from the 30 foot wide, 15 foot high hole in
the limestone cliff. Between the seven of us, we had two 2-man boats and
two air mattresses. The drysuit-clad exploration party pushed on upstream
with one boat and one mattress, loaving Holsinger, Milligan and I to follow
with Brunton and tape.
For the first two thousand feet, the mapping went quickly - all 100
foot shots, except for one 538 foot shot; We pulled the boat along with
us in the thigh-deep water. After a bit of stooping, the water got pro-
gressively deeper as the ceiling got lower until we were forced to board
the rubber boat and paddle as best we could. The passage meandered for
about 500-600 feet in this low, deep way before we could get out of the
boats again.
Another 1000 feet, and we found the other party's boat tied to a
stalagmite on a sand bar. We did likewise and alternatingly waded and
walked down passage which remained about 15 feet wide and 10 feet high.
Soon we had to face a 300+ foot crawl, from which we emerged into a flow-
stone-decorated room containing a deep siphon on one side,
Our friends were not to be found, so we guessed they had ducked un-
der the drapery and continued exploring. As it turned out, we waited on
the sand bar close to an hour before we saw a beam of light underâ€œ the
drapery.. Their voices floated under and soon four dripping bodies emerged,
all telling tales of lots more passage (2500 feet) and plenty of crawls.
Since we had mapped about a mile and were quite cold, we elected to :
head for the entrance. Almost racing, we splashed our way toward daylight,
the boats hanging up on many places where on the way into the cave they had
cleared by a foot; the water was quickly receding from the previous night's
storm.
After an attempt at a party back at the hotel, it was discovered that
we were drinking 3.2 beer and were wasting our time. This time Bob and I
spent a peaceful night on the summit of a nearby mountain.
