If there is a deficiency of water, the carbide may react
with the hydroxide present:
i i . Cacs + Ca(OII) 2 --- 2CaO + C2H2
: This reaction may be the reason why carbide lights continue
to produce acetylene long after the water has been turned off..
: Carbide also reacts with nitrogon to produce cyanamide.
The only other industrially important reactions of carbide are.
those in which its reducing properties are utilized.
- Manufacture. Simple in principle, carbide manufacture has
changed little since it was first developed in 1892. A mixture of
lime and carbon is heated in the intense heat of an electric arc
and the lime is reduced by the carbon according to the equation:
Ga0 + 3C ---
CaC2 + 60 - 11 kg.-cal.
The carbide is formed in a liquid state and contains both excess
lime and most of the impurities that were present in the raw
materials. For this reason, the raw materials are purified as
much as possible before being charged (placed) in the furnace.'
The carbon monoxide escapes through the furnace charge.
Impurities in the lime consist of silica, iron and aluminum
oxides, magnesia, sulfur, and phosphorus; these impurities should
make up no more than 5% of the lime, the remaining 95% being cao.
The most commonly used source of carbon for this reaction
in the United States is coke. The moisture content must be" loss
than 29 in order to prevent slaking of the lime (and therefore
formation of dust) when the lime and coke are mixed.
Most of the impurities merely make the cost of production
greater, but sulfur and phosphorus enter the acetylene gas gene-
rated by the carbide in the form of hydrogen sulfide and phos-
phine, respectively.
The two main 'types of carbide furnaces, which are not true
arc furnaces, are: (1) the open furnace, where the carbon monox-
ide formed in the reaction burns to: carbon dioxide when it comes
in contact with air on top of the furnace charge and is therfore
lost up the stack, änd (2) the closed furnace, where as much of
the carbon monoxide' as possible is provented from burning by
excluding air from the top of the charge and is.collected, where
it may be used as a fuel, as a source of CO2 for dry ice, or for
· chemical synthesis:
During operations, the furnaces are charged, theoretically,
with 56 parts of calcium oxide and 36 parts of carbon. The car-
bide is formed in the reaction zone around its electrodes; the
