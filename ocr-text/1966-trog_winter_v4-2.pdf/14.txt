speleothems. "East of P],um Creek Gap, on the flanks of Rich Moun-

At the lower end of Thompson Valley, north of Wards Cove,
is à large, interesting: arca lying between the ends of Knob Moun-
tain and Short Mountain. Here about ten square miles of Beekman-' .
town limestone is exposed, in a large area characterized: by low,
rolling hills and sinkholes. There are a number of small caves.....
containing large stream, channels that have not been completely
explored, and would require the use of rubber raftş.. The streams
in some of these caves are apparently the same, with at least one
of them resurging at Maiden Spring,

. The reason for including the following useless information
is to point out a few weaknesses in communications during a cave
rescue. The rescue took place last January when Ed Bauer, Dick
Hoyle; "Whitt":Whittemore, and Lew Bicking were trapped for two
days beyond a siphon in Snedegar Cave. (For details see the
spring 1965 Iroglodyte, p3.95.). The problem of finding someone who
was familiar with the Snedegar-Crookshanks system was the most im-
portant ancl. time consuming obstacle that we had to concern our :
selves with before we left Blacksburg. For obvious reasons, more
of the significant, hazardous caves and the people familiar with
them should be included in later publications of the Cave Rescue
Communications Network (CRCN) list.
