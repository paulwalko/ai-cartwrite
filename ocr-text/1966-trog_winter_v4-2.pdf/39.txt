in there for six months in the 1940's.
Early Thanksgiving morning, we checked with Charlie Gray in Castle-
wood and were given permission to map Ind.ian Cave, Charlie leases the
land above the cave. He was somewhat impressed with cur NSS literature,
Caves of Virginia, and other caving literature. He requested a map of
Indian Cave and has been sent a copy.
The entrance to Indian Cave lies in a shallow trash-filled sink se-
eral miles west of Banner's Corner. Mapping as we went, we chimneyed down
the 15 foot entrance drop, crawled for about 50 feet, and then traversed
along the top of a very muddy 45 degree slope. The slope forms one side
of the fault along which the entire cave lies. There are about 500 feet
of passage in this upper section, all of it being quite steep and muddy.
We then found our way through a hole at the bottom of the slope and
followed the slope down another 100 feet until we reached the level of
the stream. The stream was higher than I had ever seen it. 'We followed
it upstream in the direction of S700W for about 500-600 feet where the
passage appears to terminate in deep water among breakdown.
We then retr√§ded our steps and went downstream through the water;.
which often got waist deep in the passage, 15-30 feet wide: and up to 30
feet high. The passage trended in a N700E direction for over 1000 feet
and very few survey shots were less than 100 feet long. After climbing
down a roaring four foot high waterfall, we continued to the end of the
passage, z. siphon pool more than 57 feet deep. Returning upstream, we :
followed a broad sloping ledge on the north side of the passage and about
20 feet above water level. I believe that unspoiled beauty of the whites,
reds, and browns of the colums and flowstone; the cave. coral; and popcorn
make this one of the prettiest areas in any Virginia cave.
That night, we drove on to Pennington Gap and met. Holsinger and others
from the University of Kentucky, D., Grotto, PSC, University of Virginia,
and Monongahela Grotto (none other than Bill Biggers and his magic coat).
On Friday. Holsinger, Finley, Milligan (all from UK), Bob and I went
to Spangler's Cave. We back-rappelled about 70 feet through brush into
the bottom of a sink and followed a small watercourse about 500 feet down-
stream to a ten foot high waterfall. This was as far as John had been,
so the rest of the cave was new to all of us,. Although there were several
areas of duckwalking, most of the cave was traversed at the bottom or top
of a narrow canyon, or along a big trunk channel 20 feet wide, We mapped
as much as we could find - about 3000 feet - the passage ending in an im-,
possible low wet crawl..
..
After emerging, we checked out several sinks and a newly opened pit,
but found nothing of interest. This area was on the flank of the mountain
behind and above the Powell River and above Surgener's Cave.
