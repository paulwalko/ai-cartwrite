Thompson Valley, a long limestone valley devoid of any significant
surface drainage, is sitting astraddle a large anticline, forming out i
crop slopes (and caves) on both sides of the valley. On the south side is
Clinch Mountain, forming the south limb of the Thompson Valley Anticline
and the north limb of the Blue Spring Syncline. To the north is Knob Moun-
tain, resting on the axis of Wolf Creek Syncline. The entrances to Higgin-
þotham's Caves are situated hore on the south slopes of Knob Mountain,
The stratigraphy of this mountain, and its relation to the caves, is
quite interesting: The mountain is capped by a protective layer of resis-
tant Clinch Sandstone, of Silurian age. This layer forms the portentious
cliffs and crags that overlook the valley some 2000 feet below. Beneath
this sandstone cap is a thin layer of Juniata sandstonë, then a thick layer
of Ordovician-aged, Martinsburg shale. This limy shale forms the greater
part of the slopes of Knob Mountain, Beneath this is a layer of Moccasin
mudrock. The formation is named after Moccasin Ridge in southwestern Vir-
ginia. Beneath the mudrock are four layers of thinly-bedded limestone and
limy mudoch. An interesting cross-section of the Martinsburg, Moccasin,
and these lower limestone beds can be seen along the west side of Plum
Creek Gap, on Route 16 south of Tazewell.
Underlying these limestones are various middle Ordovician limestones,
including a cherty conglomerate and cherty limestone forming a row of low
hills at the base of Knob Mountain, .. Between these strata and the next low-
est member is a major disconformity. It is partly along this zone of con-
tact that Higginbotham's caves occur. Below this disconformity is the low-
est member of the Ordovician-aged formations - the 900-foot thick Beekman-
town formation..: This layer of predominantly fine-grained dolomite is noted
for its large cave systems such as Gilley's, Buchanan Saltpeter, Clover
Hollow, The Murder Holes, Luray Caverns and others. In Tazewell County,
the Beekmantown formation contains many layers of chert which can be seen
along the walls of Higginbotham's voluminous corridors. Intercalations
of limestone occur in this vicinity..
Underlying the Beekmantown formation is the Cambrian-aged Copper Ridge
dolomite, which forms the lowest part of Thompson Valley. Perhaps the
formation is named after Copper Ridge in southwestern Virginia.
The Beekmantown formation is the chief cave-forming stratum in :
Thompson Valley, - In the vicinity of Higginbotham's caves, it strikes
N400E and dips approximately 300 to. the northwest. The caves are formed
along major joints running N600€ and minor joints running 1500W, and
trend along the strike. A number of other caves in the valley occur in
the Beekmantown formation. Of. particular interest are Glenwood Church
Cave and Cauliflower Cave, on
