FALL PROJECT
::::The VPI Grotto's annual Fall Quarter Project was held this
year ätti Nowberry's Cavo in Bland County, Virginia. . .
1.7. Four caves in this area" had been discovered cind mapped' by
the VPI and Wýtheville Grottos in the carly 1950's. Newberry's
:: and Barie's caves were connected at this time and together com-
prised the third largest known cave system in Virginia until the
discovery of Gilley's Cave in Lee County. .
::" . After the mapping of Newberry-Bano's" and two other nearby
caves (Ponley's and Bane's Spring), tho system fell into inattention,
even though it was a known fact that there was a chance of a connecting
ion between' Newberry's anct Perley's. This was partially due to
difficulties of exploration; so tourist trips prevaited for a number
ofir years.
Why this cave should suddenly rise to attention is ex-
plained by two simultaneous events. A letter from Earl Thierry
. (printed in the provious Troglcdyte) contained a map of a little.''
known section of Newberry's Cave. Added to the big try'x 31 @ 7H=502)
map it ran the total passage up to two miles and 1900. feet lor,
12,460 feet). At the same time, Mike Hamilton received some dir-
ectioris from Bill Cudlington for the location of a virgin passage
in Penley's Cave which he had explored for a short distance about
: ten years ago. Some months before this, a VPI group descended into
what was believed to be a blind pit in Newberry's, and found it
small opening into about 1000 feet of passage, not on the map,
which connected into the crea on the small map sent to us by. :
Earl Thierry.
1. Im choosing this project, the objectives were many: One : sur-
face survey would be made from Bene's to Bano's Spring and another
would be made from Newberry's to Penley's. The leact in Penley's
would be checked out and, if possible, surveyed. The unsurveyed
portions of Newberry's would be mapped and further exploration
