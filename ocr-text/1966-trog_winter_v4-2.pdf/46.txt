possibly by evaporation or the effect of sunlight.) The structure of
the local hills do not seen to indicate a system quite that large; how-
ever, the area as a whole is quite auspicious. If Craig County ever
puts in a municipal water supply system, then maybe we'll know.
To digress no further, the pit was rigged and we prepared to descend.
The actual vertical descent is only 50 feet or less, but the descent is
usually made from the top of the sinkhole, making the total drop 80 or 90
feet. The upper part of the drop is in a wooded, funnel-shaped sinkhole.
The vertical part is in a wide, smooth-walled shaft.
One would think that on such a short, simple drop as this, no problem
would occur. But here, as ll people from five different caving organiza-
tions prepared to descend, there occurred a classic example. Of what, I
don't know, but it's bound to be a classic example of some thing. The
party from U.Va. wanted to use manila because nylon is too fast. The
people from Roanoke wanted to use nylon because jumars work better on it.
The VPI cavers were afraid that the 7/8 inch manila python wouldn't be
fast enough with a single brake bar.
In an attempt to solve everyone's problems, both ropes were rigged
and Tom Beaman made the first descent, only to find that the two ropes
were hopelessly entangled. After struggling with this gnarled, knotted mess
while hanging three feet off the floor, he finally solved the problem by
cutting off the tangled ends and burning them, along with a bloated sheep
carcass, in one huge conflagration. The nylon "greenline" was then hauled
up so a similar incident would not occur. Then Annie, attempting to de-
scend on the manila rope, soon discovered that one 97-pound Gremlin wasn't
enough to make a single brake bar work on 7/8 inch manila, but she made it
somehow (probably jumped). Gordon Hamilton found that his pint-sized rap-
peling spool hopelessly jammed. Hugh and Linda cbandoned their" usual.
method for a one-scarybiner, over-the-shoulder rappel. Of course, there
were three camera boxes to be lowered. Anyhow,' to make a long story short,
everyone got down in about an hour and a half.
We then entered the narrow passageway to the rest of the cave en masse,
but our progress was soon checked by the first traverse. Several short-
legged people wanted a belay, so one was set up across the "triple well."
The first two holes are easily crossed by straddling, but the third one
requiros a bit of imagination. Most people make use of a crawl slot around
to the right, but if you're too fat, then you gotta jump across.
At the third (and last) traverse, most people abandoned their camerƒÅ
boxes, but Doc Brown elected to bring his across, being lured on by tales
of a formation section at the back of the cave. When he arrived at the
back of the cave, the formations were not readily apparent.
"Where is the formation section?" he asked.
''Right here."
11 Where?!
