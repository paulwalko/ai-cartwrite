a jog over to the second joint and follows it for another 350 feet.
These joints trend eastward along the strike. Near the end, the ceiling
becomes quite low, and the passage is finally blocked by a chockstone. .
A large stream enters the cave at this point and flows its entire length,
usually occupying the whole floor. Emerging from the entrance, the stream
is directed through metal troughs into several catchment barrels which, in
turn, supply two hydraulic rams. The water now flows under the ola dam,
but a deep mud fill behind it and a consequent stream cut give évidence
of a long impoundment before it gave way. Salamanders, crayfish, and
frogs were found in the cave.

Carbo Quad. The Coons' Den could be difficult to find, being located in
flat woods 0.5 mile north of Fincastle road, 500 yards west of a county
road, 150 yards NE of a power line, and 50 feet south of an old logging
road. A narrow gully in a wide, shallow sinkhole leads to an opening six
feet wide and four feet high. · The passage inside enlarges to a tunnel ten
feet wide by eight feet high and slopes downward, curving to the right,
about 400 feet to a large room. A right-hand passage goes upward at a
steep angle back to the entrance room. A left-hand passage goes another
100 feet to a room with a pit in the floor which has some gravely sewer.
passage at the bottom. A passage above the pit leads 200 feet to another
pit. No ropes are needed for any of the pits. Altogether, there are
about 800-7000 feet of passage, counting a number of side leads.

Bob Simonds and I left from Tech on our journey to Pennington Gap,“
Lee County, Virginia, for what is becoming an annual pilgrimage by cavers
from all over the region to work with John Holsinger on the Virginia Cave
Survey,
That night, we convinced a man who lives near Dickinsonville (Russell
County) that we were not running from the law and - after we watched the
end of the Virginian on TV with him -- he showed us the entrance to Roten's
Cave. This small cave, about 50 feet above the road, has a small entrance
with a broken wooden door on it, and gradually slopes downward for about
100-150 feet to its end, a mud fill. The stoopway passagë is dry and pro-

morning. There is evidence to substantiate the tale that a family lived
