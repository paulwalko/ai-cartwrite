When it became apparent that Whitt, Ed, and Dick had not
returned, I make the following calls from Gary's house:.'
1.
Cperator (information), Marlinton, West Virginia.--We
were trying to reach the McKeever farm to find out if
2.750no was at the Sugar House. After several long de-
lays and loud noises, the operator informed me that.
there was no telephono service on Swago Creek Road. .
2. Lew Bicking's residenco, Baltimore, Maryland (for ob-
vious reasons) --No answer.
...3.
John Cooper's residence (chuck:10) --to find out if "Lew
Bicking had returned. --No answer.
Bill Plunmer's residence.--No answer.
RÃ³n" Burnotte, Weyer's Cave; Virginia.--We were trying
to find someone who knew the exact location of Snedlegar-
Crookshank System and could assist us if a rescue was
necessary. No one at VPI had ever visited the cave.
Ron informed me that Mason Sproul at U.Va. and Bob
Blackburn, Bethesda, Maryland, were familiar with the
system. He gave me Bob Blackburn's mothor's telephone
number and also the number of the operator at U.Va.
6. Bob Blackburn's mother. ---She told me how to reach Bob.
7.
Bob Blackburn, Bethesda, Maryland. ----Bob told me to call
Mason Sproul; he also prepared to join us at the cave.

U.Va. operator.--I did not reclize that the number I
had called was the operator at V.Ve. and not the Security
Cffice. After a brief (but confusing) question and
answer discussion with the operator, I gave up trying
to argue with her and asked her to connect me with the
Office of Student Affairs. (I should have asked for
the Security Office but I didn't understand this at the
the time.) I was supposedly given Mason Sproul's tole-
phone number. The U.Va, operator couldn't connect me
with this number, so I had to place another long dis- .
tance call to Charlottesville.
9.
An attorney somewhere in Charlottesville, --I had been
given the wrong number,
10. U.Va. operator (again).--This time I succeeded in
reaching the Security Office and for the first time in
a long while I was able to talk with someone of intelli-
gence. (I wis beginning to wonder if there were any
such people in Charlottesville. Later, I reached Mason
Sproul and he confirmed my suspicions.)
