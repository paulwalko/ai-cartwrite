During the five years that I have been at VPI, I have seen
the VPI Grotto change from a stagnant group of cavers to an active
expanding Grotto: There are three people, in my opinion, who were
- and are - responsible for this improvement: Gregg Marland, R.E.
Whittemore, and Ed Bauer.
Student grottos have an inherient danger due to the fact
that membership usually changes completely every four years.
This makes it easy for members to fall into the rut of learning
where a number of caves are during their first two years and then
spending their last two years taking new members back to the very
same caves. ' . This cycle, once begun, is difficult to break; few
new caves are discovered and many of the known caves in the area
remain unvisited for decades. All the group does is visit the
same parts of the same caves over and over again.
This, then, was the plight of the VPI Grotto when I first
joined.
In that first year, Gregg Marland began to break this ".
cycle. He took trips to different caves, helped update survejs,
mapped caves, and brought VPI in contact with other NSS cavers
and Grottos. He planned collecting trips with, and introduced
members to, outstanding cavers and speleologists such as John
Holsinger. With little help from the rest of the Grotto, he
and his wife Bonnie (daughter of Bill Stephenson, founder of
the NSS) wrote, edited, and printed the first VPI Grotto pub-
lication since the "Grotto Grapevine:" The Tech Troglodyte.
It was mainly his initiative and organization that resulted in
the sucessful 1963 NSS Convention at Mountain Lake, with VPI
Grotto as host.
Unfortunately, this period was marred by a debate over
policy that threatened to split or destroy the club. One group
of members wanted rigid rules governing trips and a leadership
code; the other members preferred fewer rules and more reliance
on the judgement of the members. The spokesmen of these re-
spective groups were George Farrier and Gregg Marland,
This "era of bad feelings" resulted in long, boring,
debate-filled meetings, that disgusted potential members and was
climaxed by a vote on whether or not to remove Gregg Marland
from the club for an infraction of the leadership code. Although
the club voted to keep Gregg as a member, he elected to remove
himself from most of the Grotto activities.
Gregg continued to work with individual cavers until he
graduated, but the Grotto might have reverted to the same
vicious cycle had not R.E. Whittemore continued many of the
