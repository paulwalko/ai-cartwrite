Subsequent trips discovered more passage. One mapping
trip ended in the hauling up the big drop of one member, "pooped"
by the rigors of this cave. Another trip spent the entire timë
trying to dislodge the log and gravel fill at the top of the 140
foot drop with the use of dynamite. Another trip, cavers spent
several tense moments using a 30 foot log scaling pole. to inves-
tigate several high leads near the entrance. There were several
other mapping trips which finally finished the work in August 1965.
...: Higginbotham #2 is now the subject of our interest. This
cave" lies at about the same elevation and less than 1000 feet
south of #1: It is no longer believed to tie in with #1 due to
the northeasterly direction of #1.
In the late 50's, 2 was the scene of the rescue of a caver
from the bottom of the 90 foot entrance drop: He had become
miserably cold from the great amount of water flowing in through
the top of the narrow crack.
si 'Several trips to #2 in the last five years have revealed' a
30 foot drop at the bottom of the entrance drop. A large room and
interconnecting passageways contain many holes in the floor, most
of which lead down 1002200 feet more. One of these was explored
in 1962 with the use of a ladder and a rope, : At the bottom was
a stream passage close to 1000 feet long. In addition to up-.
dating the sketch map of #2 (by Earl Thierry), there is much ex-
ploration to be done in this cave. It is not a cave to explore
in wet weather:
. It is indeed unfortunate that these two caves are visited**
so. infrequently by cavers from other areas. I have personally
never physically expended myself in any other cave in Virginia-
West Virginia to the extent that is possible in either of these
caves. We, at VPI, certainly would welcome a joint trip by any
other group wishing to help explore #2.
3 . We have recently secured the use of a nearby house :(known
as the VPI Outhouse) for sleeping facilities when caving in the
area.
