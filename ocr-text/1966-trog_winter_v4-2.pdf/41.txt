After a goodbye to all at the hotel, we headed for East Stone Gap.
Hairy Hole is referred to in Caves of Virginia as a 150 foot drop, so we ::
decided to look it up and check it over; After three hours of hiking
among limestone cliffs and steep slopes, we had to stop without ever
finding it.
We returned to Tech about 7 p.m. Sunday.

.Bane's Spring Cave is located about 1000 feet east of the well-known
Bane.'s entrance to Newberry-Bane's Cave. This cave was explored during
the recent Club Fall Quarter Project on November 13 and 14.
The entrance is through either of two holes on opposite sides of a :
large piece of breakdown. The entrance room is filled with much breakdown,
with small passages to the right and the main cave going down through a
pit near the left end of the room and paralleling the first passages on a'
lower level.
After easily negotiating the pit and 50' feet of. crawlway through a ::::
flat room, we emerged over a stream channel which underlies most of the
passage in the cave. Very little water was in this channel at tháº½ time.'
of our visit. We continued along the passage, which ran sometimes above
and sometimes in the stream channel. Several side passages branch off of
this main one, giving the cave maze characteristics.
About one half of the cave is crawling and the other half is walking
or climbing over breakdown. Unlike most caves, yards of crawling are re-
warded near the end by a large walking passage: This passage finally
narrows down to a crawlway with the stream flowing in the bottom. It is ; .
possible, though uncomfortable, to stay out of the water by. wedging be-
tween the walls but none of us attempted to stay dry. This crawl finally
opens into a spherical room with the $ream siphoning out through a hole in
the floor. It was commented that even Siphon-Go (see ad) would be of no ::
use in this situation. This siphon killed any of our hopes of finding a
natural connection between Bane's Spring and Newberry-Bane's caves.
The cave has few formations but is full of wildlife. Daddy-longlegs:
spiders were found in large numbers near the entrance. Bats, crickets,.
and mice were found, or evidence was found throughout the cave. Some of..
the crawlways were covered by a foot of this evidence which had disinter-
grated into humus. It was definitely superior to sharp gravel as a crawl-
way paving material as far as our knees and elbows were concerned.
