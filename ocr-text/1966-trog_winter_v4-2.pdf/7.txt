reaction is usually 80-85%. complete, The level oi the charge in
the furnace is maintained by fond pipes from storage bins; the
product is tapped intermittently. The molton product is run into
cast-iron chill pots of various sizes at a temperature of 1000 to
20000 C, where it is allowed to cool for a few hours. The solid
is then reinovəd from the pots and set aside for several days un-
'til the interior is cool enough for the block to be crushed. Hi

According to US government specifioations, the carbide must
yield at least 105: or 4.3 cubic feet of acetylene per pound; there
are six different sizes specified. The acetylene. yield is
measured at 600F and 30 inches barometric pressure. The evolved
gas must not contain more than 0.05% by volume of phosphoreted
hydrogen.
• Uses. : The largest use of carbide is acetylene production.
Nearly all of this acetylene is used for oxacetylene. cutting and
welding, the production of synthetic organic.. chemicals (such as
acetaldehyde, acetic acid, acetone, vinyl acetate, butanol, and ..
many other compounds and derivatives), and acetylene. black (a
unique form of carbon black). A small portion is used for lighting
purposes, making cavors a very small part of the total market.
...: The second major tonnage of carbide goes into the manufac-
ture of cyanamide by fixation of nitrogen in the atmosphere. This
is used as a fertilizer and a starting material for producing a
family of resins.
A small amount of carbide is also used as either a reducing
or a drying agent in some processes.
Producers. United States production of carbide increased
from 167,592 short tons in 1939 to 775,673 short tons in 1944.,
The market has continued to increase. Air Reduction Chemical and
Carbide Company produces carbide at Ivanhoe, Virginia, and at
Kuokuk, Iowa. It uses the registered trademark "National Carbide"
for its product. The price, as of October 18, 1965, was $171.40
per ton, delivereä, packaged in 600 paund drums.
