Much of the limestone in the cave is very rotten and made chimneying
in one place very difficult and handholds were impossible to find,
There is supposedly about two thousand feet of passage in this cave,
although those in our group felt that we had crawled at least that far.

LIPPS CAVE or Whitt Ventures into West Virginia Again; Believe It or Not.
12/4-5/65
by H.H. Stevens
Personnel: Ed Bauer, Robert E. Whittemore(!), "Lew Bicking"
Ed, Whitt and I drove up to Organ Cave, Unincorporatód and there met
"'Lew Bicking." Upon entering the cave my thoughts turned back to a: similar
foursome in Snedegars last January. But Ed gave me the reassurance, "Don't
worry, you're not as fat as Dick Hoyle, so somebody else can be teddy bear."
Yeah, sure thing.
We rapidly progressed to the ladder climb (Harjes' Horror) after
passing THE CRAWLWAY. As I tied myself on belay, I found that by so doing,
Whitt considered me as having passed my trainee knot test.. What a con-job.
From there we went through the Dressing Room, down Lipps Stream and
past Erwing Stream junction to a right hand lead about 800 feet past the
junction. This lead had not been previously entered except by Ed to leave
some bait for animal life on the last trip. Though we detected no fauna
on the bait, the lead did open up and we explored and surveyed 2609 féet
there. We terminated our survey in a large room about 40. by 40 feet and
30 feet high. The reason we stopped. was because the passage we were in
intersected the room at the ceiling with a sheer, undercut drop to the
floor of about 25 feet. We threw in one of Lew's empty cans of Kippers and
left. So, if anyone sees an empty Kipper can in a cave you know (1) who
has been there, i.e. "Lew Bicking" or "The Shadow" and/or (2) where you
are. If you don't know what a Kipper can looks like, T.S. . I suggest
that all cavers carry at all times, in their hard hats, a sketch com-
paring and identifying the following: kipper cans, sardine cans, boned
turkey cans, fruit cocktail cans, etc. Of course, no caver needs a dia-
gram to identify a brew can, so it may be omitted.
After 14 hours, we left the cave at 4:a.m. Sunday. We changed clothes,
pushed Lew's car, known as "the Gray Goose," down the hill to start it, and
departed.
An interesting note: Did you know that Ed Bauer's "Arrumph?!!!, which
he learned from "Lew, the Shadowy: Bicking" in the Snedegar's fiasco, is
actually much louder and much more startling than the original "Lew
Bicking Arrumph?!!
