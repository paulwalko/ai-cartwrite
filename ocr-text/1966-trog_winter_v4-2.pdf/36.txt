last them several days. By the time this food is consumed, the cats will
have become accustomed to living in the cave, and will use it as an ope-
rating base to fcrage for food in the surrounding pastures. After finding
the mangled carcasses of his sheep, cattle, pigs and sons near the cave,
the farmer will realize that caver's never did anything like that. Now
that his cave is no longer traveled, it has become a suitable abode for
less desirable inhabitants. After several weeks of this, he will gladly
welcome the return of the cavers. The cats will then be removed, again
under cover of darkness and returned to the kennel.
Everyone would then be happy -- the cavers, the cats, and the farmer!
But the time for action is now! Once an uneducated cave owner discovers he
can exploit the intelligent caver, he will do so to the fullest extent pos-
sible! Cavers unitel. All we have to lose is our chains.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
November 27, 1965
Dear Bob,
I stopped by Saltville recently to see Ed des Rochers and he told me
that Mike Hamilton had all the New River Cave notes and was going to draw
it up. If the whole thing has been drawn up, I would appreciate a copy of
it. I enclose a $5 check to cover the cost; if any is left over, you can
apply it on extending my Tech Troglodyte subscription.
t
I worked up a preliminary list of West Virginia caves over a mile long;
some of them are nretty vague, however. I just bought the supplement to
Davies' Caverns of West Virginia ($1.10 - West Virginia Geological Survey).
It had quite a bit of information about the caves which I didn't know about.
I am also enclosing some extra copies of miscellaneous maps which I .
thought the VPI Grotto could use.
Sincerely,
7s/ Earl. Thierry

Dear Anne,
â€¢ In reading the Fall Quarter, 1965 edition of the Tech Troglodyte, I
noticed your reference to the possible correlation between vandalism in
Breathing Cave and the publication of Caves of Virginia.
