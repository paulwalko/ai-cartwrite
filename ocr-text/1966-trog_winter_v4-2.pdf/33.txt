.. We never thought it woulr? hanpon in the world of caving, but Vol. 2,
Nos. 8&9 (onÃ«", issue) of HONDO RESCUE contains an article clearly showing that
those "fellows" are really HURTing. Reprinted in full below, the article
is titled:

. FENALE CAVERS ..:
Two female cavers have fulfille? the proper requirements
qualifying them for training with the crotto. Thoy are:
Sallie Pritchard
Kathy Murch
Our requirements for female participants are simple and the
following:
:1) They must possess all necessary equipment,
2) They should not be overly demanding.
. 3). They must be able to cave with no more help
than a man requires.
They must.not cause any commotion in the ranks.
We wish to welcome all intorested fomalos to the spcrt of
cave exploring.
...

Now, we aren't sure, but in our way of thinking the only females who wouldn't
cause any commotion in our ranks are either uglier than Tom Vigour or clder...
than Joan Crawfcrit, . Furthermore, the VPI Grotto encourages females who
cause commotion in our ranks to join the Grotto, so all of you gool-looking
Missouri cirls know where to como for a real welcome and some first-class
caving. Anel girls, if you possoss, all the necessary equipment; we don't even
mind if you are overiy demanrlincji . After all, our schoci motto, Ut Prosim" ;
translates: "That I might sorve."

which appears at the top of the first page,
The flame, which is the licht of the lost caver, shows that
the caver is lost an cannct see the way out. The arm patch
is placed on tho right shoulder so that the arrow points
forward, to the cave's entrance. The bottom half of the
arrow-shaped object is blue in color, sicnifying the condition
of the lost caver. The top half, which is rec, signifies
the first ai? training that all grotto members must have.
The shape of the figure stands for the speed and quick thinking.
of Hondo Grotto's cavers and! cave rescue team.
