CALCIUM CARBIDE
Although a large majority of cavers in the United States: use
calcium carbide lights, few of them know anything about the chemi-
cal they pour in the base of the lamp. This article, hopefully,
will provide a fairly complete picture of the history, manufacture,
uses, and produders of calcium carbide,
Â· Description. Calcium carbide (Ca) has a formula weight of
64. to: and has four known crystalline modifications: one with
cubic, one with tetragonal, and two with lower symmetry. The
tetragonal formis prevalent in ordinary industrial carbide and is
stable between 44700 and 2506,
Pure calcium carbide is transparent and colorless. It can
be produced, with difficulty, but is not manufactured commercially.
It has no commercial use; none of its properties have been deter-
mined definitely.
Commercial calcium carbide (which will from now on be re-
ferred to as "carbide") is a mixture of several chemical com-
pounds. It is composed of calcium carbide (CaC,), excess lime
(Cao), and small amounts of impurities. The nature and proper-
ties of carbide depend upon the proportions of these materials
in the carbide. Its color varies from steel gray to reddish brown.
History. Although carbide was definitely made in the labrr-
atory and accidently in side reactions in existing industrial re-
actions long before 1890, it was either not isolated or not rec-
ognized. Commercial production began in 1892 when a Frenchman
and an American independently developed an economic process using
an electric furnace. The industry expanded rapidly, anticipating
the general adoption of acetylene lighting. When this failed to
materialize, the new industry suffered from overproduction, leading
to a crisis in France in 1899. Since then, the industry has de-
veloped steadily.

Reactions. The most important chemical property of carbide
is its reaction with water. This is a violent, exothermic re-
action, and is the source of most of the acetylene used in indus-
try. It is the same reaction that occurs in a carbide lamp:
Cacz + 2H20 (1) --- Ca (OH)2 + C2H2 (g) + 29.9 Kg. cal..
The heat produced in the base of the carbide lamp, as can
be seen from the above equation comes from the heat-producing
reaction of carbide with water.
