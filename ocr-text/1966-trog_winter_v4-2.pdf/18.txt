ON LEADERSHIP

. .
Recent events have indicated that there is a semantic:
problem in the word "leadership." To me, this word describes the
ability and desire of a person to accept a certain responsibilty.
for a group of people in order to attain certain achiovments
collectively. No matter how formal or informal the group, these
barterings of responsibility for unison are tacitly understood.
Every person in this group should know his own capabilities to
the degree that he may accept or reject his position in this
group before embarkment,
Some say: The Leadership system of the Cave Club is dead!!!;.
but I say that leadership will always live whether you' paint it
green and name it or not! This is natural, course of human events ::
until the coming of the monolithic classless myth. The true .
test of degree of a leader is this: who is the least capable : 2
person that he can successfully take through a given mission by
his own ability to train and sunply vicarious confidence.
The man who will "lead" only his peers in a given situation is a
manager, not a leader. This is the maximum degree of respon-
sibility which some, who claim to be leaders, will accept. This
situation is perfectly adequate if all concerned understand the
implications, but let's not misrepresent ourselves. Each of
us must decide what degree of responsibility he will accept.
There is always a shortage in the supply of leaders not
because people lack the ability, but for lack of desire. .
I invite those, with ability, who might feel that there
is something more important or valuable than their own immediate
convenience to become leaders. I think many might find it as
rewarding (or more so) to watch another's development, to which
they have contributed their time, patience, and ability, as to
always be concerned only with their won development.
