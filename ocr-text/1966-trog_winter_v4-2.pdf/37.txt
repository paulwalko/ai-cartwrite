Regarding the Caves of Virginia, do you feel that it is the cause
for vandalism in other caves throughout Virginia, or in your evaluation
is Breathing Cave an isolated incident?...
We in Arizcna have adopted secrecy regarding cave locations and, as :
our Arizona Caver publications will illustrate, we are violently opposed
to the publication of cave locations. We suspect that publications con-
taining cave locations will be a detrement to cave conservation. For the
caves' sake, we hope that we are wrong.
I would appreciate your opinions in this matter, and your evaluation
of secrecy as a weapon against vandalism. .

BACK ON THE TRAIL OF THE LONESOME PINE
During Fall quarter another cave-location trip was taken into south-
Western Virginia. The area visited was near Lebanon in Russell County.
After much hunting, three caves were located and explored byAnne
Braithwaite, Jack Keat, John Oldenburg, Jack O'Meara, and R. E. Whittemore.
Theso are described below.
Flat Spur Hole, Russell County, Va. (36053'54" x 87055'18!). Elev: 2530'
Elk Garden Quad. Two miles east of Route 80, at Stewarts' Commissary, Flat
Spur road turns right - through a gate - and crosses a bridge on Loop Creek.
At a point where the road curves right in a saddle, the cave is 50 feet
uphill between the road and the woods. A small fissure about five feet
deep leads downward to a I intersection with another fissure. There is
about 50 feet of passage in each direction.
Three more caves, downhill and NE of this onie, have been filled. A
fifth; in dense woods ahout 400 yards east of this cne, was not located.
It is reportedly large. Another one, in the vicinity of Rich Mountain Â·
Gap, was not located because precise instructions could not be obtad aed.
It is said to have a deep vertical entrance. ..

Big Spring, Russell County, Va. (36054'08" x 8105512511) Elev. 24001..
Elk Garden Quad. In Corn Valley, two miles east of Route 80, is a red
house north of the road. About 100 yards downhill behind this house is
a cave entrance partially blocked by an old dam. The entrance is roughly
triangular, about four feet high and three feet wide, and at the base of
an escarpment of thin-bedded limestone, A well-defined joint rises from:
the apex of the triangle, and a parallel, but somewhat less-defined joint,
is visible six feet to the left. The passage, maintaining a triangular
cross-section, follows the first joint straight for 400 feet, then makes
