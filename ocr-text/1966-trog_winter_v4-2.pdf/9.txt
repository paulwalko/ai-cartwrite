THE HIGGINBOTHAM PROJECT
PART I
"
Several miles south of the town of Tazewell, in Tazewell
County, Virginiaj are located the entrances to two of Virginia's
most interesting and rugged vertical caves.
Higginbotham # t (also called the Devils Slide). and Higgin-
botham #2 lie on the east flank of Knob Mountain, in the shadow
of a rocky sandstone escarpment over 1000 feet above,
At this time, more exploration has been accomplished in #1,
with about 3000 feet of passage explored and mapped. Entrance to
#1 is gained through a wooded sink. One then travels west: for
about 100 feet down & smoothly slöping watercourse which ends in
a 12 foot drop. At the bottom of this drop are wedged logs and
fill which is actually the jumping-off place for the 140 foot drop:
The drop is clean, starting out in a fissure and close to a wall
most of the way. In the spring, water enters about half :way: down.
At the bottom of the drop are several small rooms, one with
a sand floor. The cave then trends south along a high narrow
fissure. Several climbs and drops are encountered along this fis-
sure.

After a tight :crawl for about 100 feet, the large main
passage is encountered. To the right (south), the cave continues
for only several hundred feet. To the north, the passage meanders
up and over dried mud banks and deep guano deposits, The ceiling
is between 8 and -30 feet high and the walls are sometimes. 60 feet
apart, A domepit to the right and a stream passage on the left -
which later connects with the main passage - are also of interest.
After walking: 1500 feet in a northeasterly direction in
large passage, one. passes through the formation section and into
the Bowl Room. From the Bowl Room, it is a matter of only several
hundred feet to the termination of the cave. . .
The natives of the surrounding area have mentioned more
than once the great flood of 1901 which completely filled this
cave. This is evidenced by the two-root diameter logs found both
above and below the 140 foot drop. It is doubtful that the cave
has flooded since then.
Interest in this cave was rather sporadic until some
cavers from VPI joined some from Roanoke in the winter of 1961.
Several months later, the cave was made an official project of
the VPI Grotto. The object of the project was to explore, map,
· and further investigate the Higεinbotham cave system.
