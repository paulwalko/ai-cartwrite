A fortnight later, the clever vassal neared the forbidden
castre. He left his Oxcart at the entrance and quietly began
to retrace his steps back to the treasure room with a single
t'orch for light. Daringly, he traversed the Pit of Peril, 50
furlongs deep, æ slimy path to the intermost reaches of the earth,
Silently did he pass by the entrance to the Room of Vampires,
glimpsing their velvet bodies dangling from ceiling beams. And
ever so carefully didst he pick his way through the Passage of
70,000. Horrors, when: bloated, muc-colored spiders, large poisonous
lizards, and furtive, crawling things waited their victims in the
soft blackness of the windłowless hallways.
Yet. so favorably did the gods smile down upon him, that
even without the protection of a knight, he once again found the
room of treasure, and the puro white magical flowers, luxurious
draperias, pillars of precious stone, and pockets of pearls
glittered' ancl gl.exmeçin the feeble light of the torch.
Quickly then did he work, cutting, breaking, chipping, and
Smashing, until all save the most perfect were destroyer, but the
best: he saved, storing them carefully in his pouch.
Anel so it came to pass, that when he left the once facinating
chamber, he took everything, including er portrait of the king, and
left nothing, not even his footprints.
But; glas, as the vassal began the return journey, "his
Horch burned out, and the usually intelligent servant had ne-.
glected to bring along a spare. The hapless vassal wandered:
hopelessly through the dark galleries, groping his way inch by
inch unti. I the knights, who had discovered the destruction of the
room and begun a search, fcund him. : .. ...............
So it came to pass that the vassal became a prisoner of
the knights, and they gathered in a great hall and feasted upon
many kind's of meat and drank much wine and debated as to what.
to do with the loathsome vással. And there were in the Land of
Caverns at that time two very opinionated* cliques of knights,
Onre group, called the Knighthạod of : Kastle Keepers, wanted to
tie the vassal to one of the strange pillars growing from the
castile floor and pile wood about him and set fire to the wood, ..
But the other group of knichts, known as the Society for the
Unveiling of. Castle Knowledge to Erstwhile Rehabilitated Servants,
. wanted to talk gently and reasonably with the vassal until he
saw the error of his ways, and then release him unharmed.
Yea, and great was the bitterness between these two groups,
and the Society taunted the Knighthood, saying they had kavities
under their plumed crests, instead of brains. : And the Knighthood
sneered artt. the Socioty with the fishy initials and dubbed them
the Vasgal Defenders and considered them ů social disease.'::.
