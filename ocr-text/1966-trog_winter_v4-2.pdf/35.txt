approach, and, once put into practice, will be demanded by all cave owners,
perhaps to a progressively larger recree with each visit (why, the last:
time I went to Grapevine, the owner actually had the nerve to ask me for
the negatives of any pictures I troki). Bebe long, it will be the farmer
who is riding the free horse to death, not the caver. Once again (I use
"again" because some misguided persons seem to think there was a first
time)', the sport of caving will be threatened, but not for lack of' tolerant
land-owners. There will, insteart, be a lack of tolerant cavers. Can you
imagine a more ridiculous situation? Take, for example, the average.caver:
intelligent, educated, reasonable, and willing to do a fair amount of .
apple-polishing. He's not infallible, to be sure, but certainly more so.
than the average cave owner: ignorant, unreasonable, demanding, belliger-
ent, and possessing a high tendency to confuse cause and effect. Now that
we have put the parties in a proper perspective, let me pose this question:
which had you rather be, the rider or the ridden? Don't think that being
ridden will stop with sending prints of photographs and tacking up those
"private property" signs. Imagine yourself spending your weekends re- .
pairing gates, mending fencos, filling in deeply-rutted roads, etc. Seems
a bit far-fetched?. Well, all three experiences have occurred among mem-
bers of this club!
The simple solution to this whole impending disaster is to adopt a
more realistic attitude toward cave owners. Let them know subtlely that .
the cavers are still riding the free horse. I am not condoning disrespect
by any means. Show the poor peasant normal courtesios, reasonable civil-
ness and a due amount of consideration for his property, but don't bring
sugar cubes for his mule." We must adopt the attitude that not all cave
owners are fountains of good sense, and it is not encumbent upon us as
cavers to fulfill their demands.
...Now come's the big question; what happens when some obstinate cave
owner closes his cave?' I use the word "obstinate" without reservation,
because he will not see that the fence wouldn't have fallen down if it had
been built right in the first place, that his field wouldn't have been
torn up if he had built a decent access road to the cave, that his cattle
wouldn't have been wiped out by carbide poisoning if he had put out.
enough salt blocks for them, or that the cate collapsed from normal wear
and tear, etc., etc. Here is where the intelligent cavers can take posi-
tive action, First, mail him (if he can read), in place of a letter of
apology, a set of figures showing him how the economy of certain poverty-
stricken areas (such as his) have been helped by tourist trade with cavers.
Frequent his neighbors caves so he will see what he's missing. A re-
scurceful caver will be able to think of many more schemes to fit each
situation.

If these simple schemes all fail, then it will be time for the whole
grotto to swing into action with the "master plan," which I shall now
describe. First, a number of wildcats must be captured and placed in a
kennel. When it is discovered that an irate farmer has closed his cave
for some selfish purpose, a pair of these wildcats will be placed in the
cave under cover of darkness. Along with the cats will be enough food to
