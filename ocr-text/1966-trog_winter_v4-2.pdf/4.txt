activities begun by Gregg. Whitt has worked to keep the Troglo-
dyte publishing, done a tremendous amount of original work in
southwestern Virginia and other caving areas, founded the quar-
terly club projects, held the office of vice-president, and or-
ganized the 15th Annual Regional Meeting at Blacksburg, along
with Ed Bauer.
Ed, absent during part of this time, came back to VPI
with information and contacts that has expanded the Grotto's
knowledge of other cavers. Through Ed, VPI members have met
other cavers and interest in regional and national functions has
increased tremendously. From these contacts, VPI has acquired
a growing reputation among other grottos,
In the past two years, VPI has removed the leadership code
from the constitution, devoted meetings more toward caving, re-
vived the program after each meeting (thanks to Whitt), and has
grown at an exponential rate (see Ed Morgan's article in this
issue).
'Just last year, the VPI Grotto acquired a new member
"recruited" by (again) Whitt from the Potomac Speleological Club
(PSC). Anne Braithwaite was editor of the PSC publication and
moved to Blacksburg just in time to keep the Tech Troglodyte from
dying out for lack of support. It has been Annie's thankless task
to type each and every stencil used in this pubƒçication,
There are many, many other members" who contributed to the
upgrading this, one of the oldest Grottos, but space does not
permit me to mention all of them. The people named above were
key figures, but would have accomplished nothing without the
support of others..
... VPI is expanding (15,000 students by 1974), the Grotto is
working closely with Charlie Maus: (WVACS) in West Virginia, there
is a large body of active members, the club is doing a great deal
of exploration and location work, and there are many good poten-
tial leaders with the ability and initiative to continue the ex-
pansion of VPI's influence in the Virginia Region. In fact, two
of our members are new Regional officers. :
The future looks bright.
