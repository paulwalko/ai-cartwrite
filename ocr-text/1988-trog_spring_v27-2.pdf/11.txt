PART II
(Thanksgiving Break, 1987)
After returning to Virginia Tech and meeting up with the cave club my
interest was once again turned toward finding caves around home that could be
explored during breaks and summer vacations. Once again Mark and I got
together and went in search of suitable caving material.
Our biggest discovery was the state book store in Harrisburg (the capitol
of Pennsylvania and roughly fifteen minutes from home). Mark was doing a
research paper for his geology class in college and needed mineralogical maps
of the area. He had heard from his professor that he could get them at the
book store and I ended up tagging along.
While he looked around for the maps that he needed I wandered around
looking at what they had to offer. It was mainly pamphlets and short books
published by the department of environmental resources as well as every other
department in the Pennsylvania government adding their fair share. After
flipping through a study of "Provenance, dispersal, and depositional
environments of Triassic sediments in the Newark-Gettysburg Basins" I came
across a book called "Geology and Biology of Pennsylvania Caves." Looking
further, I also found folders bearing the names "Caves of Western
Pennsylvania" and "Caves of Southeastern Pennsylvania." Mark purchased the
maps that he needed and I bought the book and two folders that caught my
attention.
Returning home and opening the packages, we found that the folders
contained books filled with descriptions and small maps of quite a number of
caves along with a number of separate maps of more interesting caves, some
that were actually in our area. The book had rather interesting studies of
how caves are formed, hydrologic models, various animals that inhabit them,
and all sorts of interesting tidbits of information.
The folders added other information. The cave we had explored that
summer was officially "Yellow Breeches Cave #1." "Yellow Breeches Cave #2"
was a bit further downstream and was a bit (but not much) larger. We also
discovered a few more local caves and noticed that the large caves in the area
(still much smaller than the caves I knew from Tech) were located further
south, toward York. The end of break put things off until Christmas.
PART III
(Christmas Break, 1987)
After only one caving trip during the last three weeks of the quarter
(with Don Anderson to Pig Hole) I was once again ready to search out local
caves back home.
The books and maps from the state book store told of several caves that
would not require too much hiking to check out. The first two on our agenda
were located on the bank of the Susquehanna River (which flows past
Harrisburg). The first cave turned out to open out onto a rather major road.
After determining that we probably could get into it, but that it would have
