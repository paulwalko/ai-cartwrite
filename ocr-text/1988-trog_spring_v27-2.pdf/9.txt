designated an ELMT and the bowl was presented to Dave Shantz at his 30th birthday party.
Another event of note at that same party was the Mike Fiore purity test. Mike administered
a series of 400 questions about sex, drugs, trouble with the law, perversions, etc. to a group of
people who aren't used to taking tests when they know the answers to the questions. Here are
a few scores which were reported (0 being slime, 100 being virgin):
Jim Gamble -- 100; Paul Hess -- 42; Dougo Bohn -- 27; Mike Fiore -- 50; Sallie Pearson -- 51.
Draw your own conclusions about Mike and Sallie's scores being so close together.
Dave Shantz's 30th birthday coincided with another one of Jackie Redder's "girls only"
parties. Those celebrating Dave's birthday had about a five-hour head-start, and decided to
crash the other party with the help of Berta Kirchman. Berta played decoy, getting the door
open for Philip Ballister, Dave Cinsavich, Dave Shantz, Mike Futrell, and Paul Kirchman,
who streaked through the living room for the amusement of the assembled ladies. Beth
Wichterman claims to have had the best view, but is kicking herself because she wasn't
wearing her glasses at the time. Dave Cinsavich is sure to be recognized in next year's awards
ceremony for tripping and falling at a moment when speed was crucial.
Certain female members of the club have gone to great lengths in the cause of feminism
this past quarter. Of special note is Cecile James' trip to New River cave with 16 boy scouts.
This is the current club record. Sallie Pearson comes in second for being the lone female on a
trip to Pig Hole with 5 men, and Beth Wichterman is third as the lone female on a caving trip
with 3 men.
Craig Roberts, Mike Fiore, and Jim Washington made the front page of the Current
Section in the Roanoke Times as daring VPI cavers. They took two women reporters to
Starnes' Caverns and told them that a VPI caver can "disassemble, re-fuel, and re-assemble a
carbide lamp in seconds."
A number of VPI cavers made themselves unwelcome in Harrisonburg this spring at
JMU's spring fling, held at Aqua Campgrounds. Not everybody has a sense of humor.
The Cave Club elected new officers in March. The newly elected are: Ben Keller,
president; Paul Hess, vice-president; Jim Gamble, treasurer, and Dougo Bohn, secretary.
Speaking of Dougo, this is one person to watch out for. Since becoming a full member,
Dougo has some impressive achievements to his credit. He has been picked up for
drunk-in-public (he fell asleep outside of South Main St. Cafe). He has been nominated for the
club's homecoming queen candidate. He has joined Paul Hess as a co-club-gigolo. Expect big
things from this man by the time he becomes a senior (assuming he still prefers the company of
the Cave Club to that of his old cell-mates. Squeeaal!) Dougo's hair grease is rapidly
becoming legendary.
The annual picnic took place in the traditional field at Buddy Pendley's. Six die-hards
biked the approximately forty-five miles from Blacksburg to Skydusky Hollow. They were :
Philip Ballister, Beth Wichterman, Jean and Bob Simonds, Ko Takamizawa, and Barbara
Goodreau. Barb is living in Bedford now, and has become a mother recently. The only
mishap of the picnic was when Theresa Croft stepped in a hole and broke/sprained her ankle.
Mike Fiore suggested that much fun could be had by shooting drunks with a dart-gun filled
with heroin and thorazine mixture. The one notable caving incident to be reported was that at
some point climbing up the Devil's staircase, Cecile James couldn't get her derriere over a
climb, and required some gentlemanly assistance from Tom Banks. As for the rest of the
picnic, ths assembled cavers enjoyed a weekend of caving, volleyball, beer-drinking, eating,
bonfire-ing, singing, and the traditional Sunday drink-marathon to finish the kegs. Much
credit goes to Jim Gamble, picnic chairperson; Joe Uknalis, food subcommittee; and the
warmed up, pre-cooked pig.
Upcoming events: Craig Roberts is float trip admiral this year. Float trip will be a week
after finals. Don't forget OTR on labor day weekend. Glen Davis and Jerry Redder will be
coordinating OTR work weekends on July 16th and August 20th at the OTR site in Daley
W.VA. Glen and Jerry tried to get fired by drinking, getting rowdy, and insisting on answers
at the OTR meeting they attended, but Bob Amundson maintained order, and they got a budget
increase instead.
GCCS!
(Ed note -- I won't tell you who wrote most of this, but I will tell you who didn't: everybody
in the club except Jim Gamble.)
