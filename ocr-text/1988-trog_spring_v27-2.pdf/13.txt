G.C.C.S Update
The Giles County Cave Survey is going slowly but surely, as expected.
There are still well over one hundred caves to locate and map, but some
progress has been made and continues to be made. The following mini-reports
are in no particular order, they are just going on the page as I think of
them:
Just a few months ago, Chicken Hole was a promising lead in the Sugar
Run drainage. After several rock-pounding trips, it now stands as a
promising lead 2 1/2 KBL (Ko Takamizawa Body-Lengths) long. Apparently more
spectacular is the view of Philip Balister's car silhouetted against the
skyline, particularly after you have had a few sips of peach-flavored brandy
(the official Winter drink of GCCS.) When asked why Chicken Hole deserves
so much attention, Balister will reply with the famous excuse, "lots of
air..."
A whole horde of people have now seen Beanie Hole, such as it is. First
recognized as a good, easy dig by Jim and Dave Washington, its location
above the major resurgence of Sinking Creek has made several digging trips
seem worthwhile. Jin, Dave, Maureen, Mike Palethorp, Doug Dodd, and Kent
Carlson have all taken their turns so far. With 37 feet so far excavated,
it now appears that Ed Devine's Improved Digging System will be needed,
along with the proven-to-be-good fireplace implements. The plentiful bones
in the dig have been identified by Fred Grady as coming from deer, .
woodchuck, woodrat, striped skunk, a medium-sized bird, a turtle, and a
large catfish, none of which seemed particularly old.
Actual surveying is progressing in Wire Hole and Straleys Cave #2. Both
caves will require "one more trip," but we've heard that before.
Mike Futrell and the Wilburn Valley Project continue to find more things
that go down in Yer Cave (18 roped drops at last count). Price's Strike
Cave is also a going enterprise. "Map as you find it" has turned several
Wilburn trips into grueling expeditions. Blobs of mud emerging from these
caves are often later identified as Doug Bruce, John Dowell, and Jack Kehoe.
Keith Goggin, Bob Amundsen, and "that crowd" haven't worked their turf
in a while, but initial reports of tight drops with tight crawls at the
bottom indicate that "this crowd" isn't missing much.
Completed surveys for this report include only Pembroke Railroad Cave #1
(45 it.), Pembroke Railroad Cave #2 (268 ft.), and Sibolds Cave (73 ft.),
all of which appeared in Douglas in some form or another.
Ridgewalking was the prine focus of GCCS this past season, with scores
of beers logged in the process. Clover Hollow was walked again several
times. Jim, Mike Fiore, and Sallie Pearson relocated Jim Millers Cave after
braving vicious (though friendly) herds of sheep and finding that the most
promising sinkhole in the hollow has a new pond in the bottom. Jim, Nike,
