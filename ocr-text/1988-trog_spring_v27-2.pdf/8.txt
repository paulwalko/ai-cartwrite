missed picnic because he was studying for his Instrument Flight Rules license test. Ko has
finally got his project under control, and may soon have his Master's degree. Richard Cobb is
finishing up his Ph.D. What will he do with himself after that? Pat Nickinson won the
Graduate Teaching Assistant of the Year award and got her picture and bio in the VPI
newpapers. Congratulations! Dougo Bohn had an interview with a high-tech,
defense-contractor type of company, but to get the job, he will have to pass the "whiz quiz".
Just say no, Dougo. Mike Fiore, at odds with the current "Just say No" program, has been
instructing a classroom of children in Pearisburg to "Just say No, Thank You." Finally,
congratulations are in order for Craig Roberts who was accepted into veterinary school in
Georgia (see photo).

THIS WILL BE THE FIRST VIEW OF THE NEW WORLD FOR SEVERAL YET-TO-BE-BORN CALVES
The annual banquet this year was held at the Blacksburg Country Club, way the hell out in
the country. There were more than one hundred current and former cavers present, dressed in
their best. Dougo Bohn was seen wearing a tie (probably borrowed). Joan Hedrick wore the
favorite outfit of the evening, a very short, black leather dress with a low-cut mesh front that

was not given this year, especially with a worthy candidate, Cecile James, who flipped her
truck this past year. Come on! She could have at least gotten the "safe-driver" award!
Jackie Redder got the A.I. Cartwright award for service above and beyond the call. Chuck
Shorten was recognized for his spectacular feat at OTR with the flame-out award. The
traditional "favorite landowner" award went to our traditional favorite landowner, Buddy
Pendley. Jim Washington received an honorary landowner award in the form of a sign
"Truspassers wil git gutt shot ded". Finally, Ko Takamizawa received recognition for his
ability to get lost in a cave with a special "Exit" sign.
Craig Roberts, Ko Takamizawa, Beth Wichterman, Cecile James, and Philip Ballister went
south over spring break to bounce pits in Georgia. Among their stops were Ruby Falls, and a
fireworks stand. Philip bought a large quantity of fireworks, several of which came with him
to Jim G.'s full-membership party. When things got dull, Philip launched a bottle rocket down
the toilet, shattering the back and tank into tiny porcelain pieces. The toilet was post-humously
