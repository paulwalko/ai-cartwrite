established control over some small part of his life. He is a winner. Or perhaps the "tests" we find
in a cave are tests in the more literal sense. That is, by facing the odds, we test how much we
deserve to survive. Beating the odds reaffirms our right to be alive. That's all conjecture. What I
do know is that I have never felt as ALIVE as I feel when I take that risk, and feel the fear deep in
my guts.

A BEEFY RESCUE
It was Friday April 22, 1988 and the VPI Cave Club's meeting was almost over. Only the
announcements of who wanted to go caving in the next few days were left as the last point of
business (except for where to hold the party, of course). Pete Sauvigne spoke up and said that
he was in town and going to New Castle Murder Hole. He also stressed that if the club didn't
want to run a rescue out of the hole, then someone else may want to volunteer to accompany him.
Fortunately, after the meeting a group of concerned souls gathered around Pete and discussed
plans for the next day's trip.
Seven thirty came awful early for most of us, and everyone finally met at the signout by eight
o'clock. Doug Bruce, Dave Colatosti, John Dowell, and I, Doug Dodd, piled into Pete's van
and set off on our quest for Murder Hole. The hour drive to the cave was filled with talk of how
much alcohol was consumed the night before, and what we were going to expect in the dark
today. The day was progressing slowly.
We arrived at the farm at approximately 9:00 am, talked to the land owner, Frank Sizer, for a
while, signed the register, changed, and made haste for the pit entrance. To make a long story
short, (too late -- Ed. note) the adventure inside the cave was great and went off without a hitch.
The real story begins after the entire extravaganza was just about over. Pete had ascended
rapidly with his rope walker system and had a beer ready for each of us as we reached the top.
As we turned around, Mr. Sizer was driving up the hill where we were located. He hopped out
of his truck and informed Pete and I that there was a need for a cave rescue. The day was turning
out to be interesting!!!
Mr. Sizer had told us that one of his neighbors cows had fallen into a pit. What he neglected
to tell us was that this animal was not only a cow, but a very large, ticked off bull named George.
I figured that if we coudn't get him out we would at least be eating well for a while. By the time
we arrived on the scene, a group of locals had already shown up. Many of them, in an effort to
impress their girl friends, had offered to wrestle the beast down and tie harnesses around him. I
placed my money on the bull.
The only conceivable way to get George out of the pit without harming him was to rig a
heavy duty hi-line and hoist him out. Scrounging around in Pete's van we were able to find and
utilize several hundred feet of steel cable, a bunch of industrial strength pulleys, and two come
alongs to rig the pit. Two of the local men were then sent down to convince George that it would
be a good idea to put the harnesses on. My money was still on the animal.
Miraculously, the two were charming enough. The bull was rather cute in its new attire of
hot pink webbing. A loop was fastened around his hind quarters and another fastened around his
shoulders. (Obviously, I lost my money.) As soon as the webbing was connected to the rig,
Pete revved up the engine of the van, and the bull was suspended in mid-air. After a few minutes
