and Craig Roberts relocated Small Room Cave and found a dig under a Pontiac
hood. The BIG HOLE two-thirds of the way up John's Creek Mountain is just
an illusion (just ask Mr. Price, the owner), but it really should be
checked. Anyone for a vertical hike? Jim and Dave Colatosti also found a
new cave near Clover Hollow Cave that needs to be dug open, but haven't been
able to obtain permission to do so.
Jim, Tom Bank, and Cecile James found a few almost-diggable things with
obvious air-flow near Pig Hole. Hail, rain, and lightning bolts hindered
the excursion, which was really only trying to find Echols Cave to survey
it. Hission not accomplished, although the natives were quite hospitable.
Jackie Redder is working on a lead or two inside the Pembroke town
limits.
Cecile did some cave-hunting near Staffordsville and found some of the
Big Walker Creek Caves.
Cecile and Craig also plumbed Three Second Pit. The pit is a total of
140 it. deep, with three off-set drops.
Dave C. and Sallie found that locating Salt peter Cave Branch Cave is
difficult if you can't figure out which creek is Salt peter Branch. The cave
continues to elude and confound.
Work continues on locating existing maps of some of the major caves in
the county. VSS still does not have the most recent maps of New River, Pig
Hole, Kimballton Mine, Wilburn Valley, Starnes, and probably several others.
Total footage for Giles stands at 111, 907 ft. in 33 caves for which the
surveys are complete, and 11,060 ft. estimated in 110 caves for which we
have estimates. Fifty-odd caves in the VSS locator remain that we have very
little information on, and more new ones keep appearing at our feet. A few
of the mapped caves probably deserve to be redone.
There is still a lot of work to do.
