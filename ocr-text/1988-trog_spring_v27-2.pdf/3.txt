PRESIDENT'S COLUMN
This has certainly been the worst quarter of my graduate career. I broke up
with my girlfriend the first week of classes, started working on my thesis, took
two classes for "fun," and became the president of the VPI Cave Club. So far
the task hasn't caused me much pain; aside from having to take care of scouting
types who want their boys to go caving, I have had little to do. Of course we
had the joy of deciding the fate of our CD funds, but now the fun is over and
I'll have to settle for more mundane activities.
GCCSing is one of these activities (even though it is usually preempted by
either boy scouts or school work), and although some alumni come back and
laugh at the concept of GCCS, there are new caves to be found and old caves to
be extended. Philip and I have been working in the area opposite Starnes,
which is a very exciting but so far unyielding karst zone. Of course,
Newberry-Bane's is still being mapped by the Zo's who are still looking for
suckers. I might even do some surveying in Newberry's this summer, if GCCS
doesn't get in the way, that is.
One of the more unpleasant aspects of my being new to this position is that I
feel obligated to listen to drunk cavers who have good political observations.
This will pass. ...I had something preachy here, but there is enough of that in
the next paragraph. This way nobody will have to rescue me from drunk cavers
with any sort of political observations.
Oh, yeah! Rescues... We have had a problem with people signing out. In
particular, the people who sign out so they have just enough time to squeak in
before we send someone to look for them. The problem is that people are not
giving themselves any pad time, not realizing that we start a rescue procedure
AT the given return time. Each trip needs to have enough time for travel, doing
the planned cave trip, and for any minor problems (car and caving) or deviations
from plans which might come up.
So, suppose you are leading a crossover trip to Newberry-Banes. Your
party is made up of people you don't cave with enough to know what may make
them freak; you should immediately give yourself an extra hour or two over
your estimate. Then you need to consider travel time, time spent with Buddy,
and the possibility of a flat tire or something. Then add it all up and think about
it to make sure you didn't screw up (i.e. no pizza time included). Then consider
when your return time will be. We don't want to have to get up at 3 a.m. to
check if you are back. So, if having a rescue start at eight a.m. isn't good
enough for you, sign out for eight and make arrangements with someone else
(either for them to check the signout, or for you to call them at your real return
time).
I think it is unfortunate that we are having the problems that we are. They
are not coming from just new members or trainees, but are coming from older
members in the club as well. I have discussed this problem with some people,
and most seem to agree that it is more than simply obnoxious. I will be creating
a statement of our signout policy to address the problem. I would like to have
the opportunity to get some feedback before making any decisions, so I will
wait until Fall Semester to make the policy available.
For the time being, anyone who causes a false rescue (without reasonable
cause in the eyes of his/her peers will be subject to severe public chastisement
and forced to purchase a full keg of beer to supply the club's habit.
I'm through with bitching, so in the immortal words of my predecessor:
Yo!
Ben
Er, Ben? That's supposed to
be "Oi!" -- Ed. note.
