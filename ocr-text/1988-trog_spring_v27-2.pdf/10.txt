Caving in Southeastern
Pennsylvania
or
"You call this a f---ing cave?"
(You get the idea)

PART I
(Late Summer, 1987)
After getting some minor caving experience in the State College area of
Pennsylvania, my friend, Mark, and I decided to find out what sort of caves
our local area had to offer. We had heard of a few caves and their general
locations from several people and picked a nice afternoon so that we really
would not mind tramping around all afternoon looking for holes in the ground.
Packing our helmets and carbide lamps, change of clothes, and everything else
into the back of my '74 Peugeot station wagon we drove to the first site.
"Lisburn Cave" was on private property so we went up to the landowner's
house to see if we could get permission to go into the cave. Not having any
club membership behind us, our appearance worked against us and we did not
get anywhere. A second cave, known locally as "Yellow Breeches Cave," was
supposedly about 1000 feet downstream from a steel truss bridge over the
Yellow Breeches Stream. We drove past the bridge every day to get to high
school so locating that was no problem. This was nearby to Lisburn and was
not on private property so we decided to check it out. We arrived at the
scene, readied our gear, and set off down the west side of the creek after
figuring that the east side was a lot harder to negotiate. After a bit of
hiking and one run-in with an enraged raccoon (shit scale rating rather low)
we spotted the outcrop of rock and the entrance. Of course it was on the
other side (medium shit scale rating). Rather than going back and coming down
the other side, we waded across the stream to the entrance which was located
in a waist-deep pool of water.
Climbing up into the cave we got out of the water. The floor was loose
dirt for the most part and stuck very nicely to our wet clothes. The "cave"
turned out to be a fissure through the limestone that opened up at the bottom
nearly enough for one person to crawl through. After fifty feet and the
spotting of one "pale red salamander" the fissure opened up into a "room
three times as wide as the passage and high enough to nearly sit up.
After crawling out looking like creatures from the brown mud lagoon, we
decided that this would be a nice place to go to drink beer or take girls to
go skinny-dipping without being bothered, but as a cave it rated rather high
on the shit scale. The rest of the summer was spent canoeing and making
home-made bombs to blow things up (generally anything clearing an 8.5 on the
shit scale). We figured that until we had more experience with landowners,
possible club backing, and some better caves, we had better leave caving alone
for a while.
