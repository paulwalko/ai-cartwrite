drove straight through to Blacksburg, arriving 33 hours later,
On the way back through Texas, we stopped off briefly at Gill
Ediger's to get rid of our Mexican gringo, Alex, Someone
mentioned in passing to Gill that in leaving Mexico we had
returned to the real world. He replied, "No, you just left the
real world." In the months since we've been back, most, if not
all, of those on the trip have started planning their next trip
to ,,,,, Mexico.
