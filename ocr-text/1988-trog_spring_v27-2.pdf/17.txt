of it out of the rigging with Gary. I sure hope I have
everything. Over the edge and past the pull-up Jumar. It's only
been about three minutes since I decided to go and I guess I'm
committed now. Should I look down yet? ...
The bottom was about ten acres, I think, although it was
difficult to judge. It's fairly dark with but a few struggling
green plants. And above, 1100' straight up, is that patch of
daylight called the entrance. Definately awesome. Not too long
after I got down Jerry Redder and Don Anderson started out on one
rope while Bob Alderson and Cecile started out on the other rope.
After Bob and Cecile cleared their rope, Jean and I started out,
a climb that I will always remember, We left the bottom quickly,
but it took us forever to get to the top. I think some sort of a
time/ space warp must have gone into effect once we got about 2007
up. It was like we were in the twilight zone. As we climbed,
nothing moved except the piece of rope immediately in front of
us. The walls, the floor, and, most importantly, the top all
remained stationary. Even when we were on the bottom looking up
at someone else climb, the impression was the same, We could see
their feet taking steps yet they don't move. The only gauge of
progress we had was time. Alderson and Cecile had taken slightly
over an hour to get out so after climbing for half an hour we
figured we were about half way out.
As we climbed dusk settled in and we were treated to the
spectacle of the resident parrots returning to the cave while we
were on rope, I should say we heard rather than saw, as we
listened to the bizarre whistling of hundreds of birds diving
into the pit, Very spooky. Then one of them hit the rope
causing it to thwang like a giant guitar string. Even spookier,
And as we neared the top, a ghost-like apparition appeared in the
deepening gloom below us on the other rope, As the apparition
got closer, we gradually realized that it was Berta in the
process of blasting her way to the top in something like 32
minutes, She reached the lip at the same time we did after
leaving the bottom over a half an hour behind us. As we
recovered from the climb and waited for those behind us to come
out, we were overcome by a combination of relief and
accomplishment. We'd done it. Golandrinas was behind us.
On Christmas, Cecile, Gary, Bob and Chris did a horizontal cave
within walking distance of Tamapatz. Most of the rest of us did
day hikes around the local area; it was too beautiful a day to go
underground. Then on Sunday (I think) most of the group did 414'
Sotano de Cepilla. I opted out as I'd done what I came to Mexico
to do,
Monday we left Tamapatz for Ciudad Valles where we spent two days
at a fairly luxurious hotel at a hot spring. Behind the hotel
was a small hole which we nerd caved. Also, Pablo, Jerry, Paul
and Berta went to a real cave nearby called Rio Choi (I think)
while the rest of us just sat around and drank Coronas,
Wednesday we drove back up through Cuidad Victoria and on to
Monterrey. Then we left Monterrey early New Year's morning and
