been fine if I was auditioning to sing soprano in a Handel's Messiah, but I wasn't. Pain
and I didn't get along very well, so I adjusted my seat the best I could while I was
hanging there (Ed. note??!!??!!) and continued onward and upwards...
I was approximately 50 feet off of the bottom, and I was discovering that this climbing
thing was getting real old, real fast. I was pausing almost every time I sat down and my
progress was very slow. To make matters worse, I was watching out for bats that were
hanging on the wall. Although there were only a few, I had completely forgotten where
they were hanging. I certainly did not want to hit a bat off the wall, and I'm sure the bats
didn't want me to either. I slowly continued to make my way up the rope, inch by inch...
There I was at 75 feet off the bottom. Finally the top was within sight, barely. I was
now almost utterly beat. I wondered whose idea this was and wished I could kill him.
"Why couldn't they put a back entrance into this place?" I thought, "I know there is an
elevator in this place; it's just that Craig and Doug like to do things the hard way." I
knew I was just kidding myself. I needed to keep my spirits up. I couldn't quit now -- if
I did, I would never get out, and would be doomed to spend the rest of my life hanging
on a rope in Pighole. Not only that, but I didn't think Doug would be too happy about
spending the rest of his life in the mud at the bottom of Dope's Drop...
90 feet was where I was hanging around. I was more bushed than before, and
wondering what the hell I was doing here. The overhang I had to maneuver to get to the
top of was about ten feet away, and the bottom -- a very long 90 feet away. All I could
see was a small dot of light from Doug's lamp. It was about that time when I began to
doubt the strength of my prussik rope. "What am I, nuts?" I wondered. "I am here, 90
feet above the floor hanging on some little piece of rope that is maybe a third of an inch
thick!" I knew the stuff could hold thousands of pounds, or at least that's what I was
told, but there was that little voice in the back of my head saying, "Look pal, that rope is
only a third of an inch thick, it could break at any time." I tried to fight the voice and
convince myself that I was completely safe. And so I continued...
I was only a few feet from the ledge, and could hear Craig. He was mumbling or
singing, I couldn't quite tell, something about pigs, and holes, and entering the rear.
Sounded like he was beginning to lose his mind. "Oh, no!" I thought, "Hypothermia is
beginning to set in. His mind is going. I must be taking too long." I moved as fast as a
dead person could, and I finally reached the ledge.
I peered over the lip and saw Craig and he said, "Ok, all you have to do now is push
away from the ledge with your feet and slide your seat knot up past it." I thought that
was easier said than done. He wanted me to push myself out over this 100 foot drop
relying on this little piece of prussik rope. Yeah right! So for a short while I tried to do it
my way. I eventually got the seat knot just over the lip. It was rubbing against the rock.
When I glanced at the knot, it looked as though the rope in the knot was nearly sheared. I
panicked for a moment, and then after closer inspection realized that it was just the mud
caked on the rope that gave it that appearance. Whew! After a brief pause, I assembled
all the strength I could and with a heave and a ho I climbed over the lip and to the top of
the drop. I pulled myself over to where it was safe and collapsed. With what seemed to
be my last breath I said, "People do this for fun?"
