to be at about three in the morning to avoid notice, we set off in search of
the other cave. This one was more remote, being in the side of a cut made for
a railroad track. Unfortunately, upon further investigation it proved to be
filled with track ballast after several feet so that small children would not
get lost in it. We decided that gated or otherwise closed caves had a value
on the shit scale to be determined later and left it at that.
Another pair of caves was sighted. Our trusty books denoted them
"Williams Grove Caves #1 and #2." Once again they were on the opposite side
of the Yellow Breeches Stream (which curves through half of the county). This
time the stream was wider and December temperatures proved to be a bit cold
for wading across. The combination rated high enough on the shit scale to
deter any attempts at further exploration. The caves were filed away for
summer exploration and a note was made that we should check out the hypothesis
that Pennsylvania caves usually came in pairs.
The rest of the break was filled out with minor crimes (seven in all) and
the usual holiday festivities.
PART IV
(Spring Break, 1988)
Given one week and four interviews in two states, there was not much time
left for caving. The final Saturday was set aside for some activity. The
choice came down to drunk canoeing, searching for caves, or blowing something
up.
When Saturday came, the weather rated rather high on the shit scale which
ruled out the first two ideas. Explosions always look best at night so we
spent the day playing computer games and committed the usual crimes (only
four) and did some interesting pyrotechnical displays (including a rather
impressive four foot diameter fireball) before I returned to Tech Sunday
morning.
CONCLUSION
(Summer Vacation, 1988)
Plans are being made to connect up with York Grotto in Pennsylvania so as
to not be totally bored this summer. Also, possible trips to State College
and Blacksburg to do some caving with Nittany Grotto and VPI are being
considered. Further drunk canoeing, explosive manufacturing, skinny-dipping
with fair maldens, minor crimes, and a standardization of the shit scale are
being tossed around. As always, most plans will be thrown out the window and
natural chaos and spontaneous activity will replace them.
