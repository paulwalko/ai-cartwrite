of struggle, the bull was guided to safe ground and the webbing cut. George simply strutted
away as if nothing had ever happened, apparently just as concerned about his image with his
women as the locals were.
The rescue was successfully accomplished and many asked how they could repay us. Being
the good community minded cavers that we were, no compensation was accepted. We de-rigged
and left to rejoin the other three of our group who were waiting at the original cave with cold
beers in hand. Stories were told, beverages consumed, and gear packed for the ride home. Pete
was right, a rescue did go down at New Castle Murder Hole, and thank God it wasn't us!

In addendum to the story on the "Beefy Rescue", most of what was reported was true except
for the following:
- The bull was actually a 300 pound calf.
- Her name was not George.
- She actually fell through the earth only about eight to ten feet.
- No money was bet.
- A Z-rig with conventional static rope and pulleys was used, not a steel cable hi-line.
- The cow was actually fairly docile.
- The locals were not really charming, but did wrestle her down and put the loops around
her.
- Pete was able to hoist her out single handedly.
- And finally, the webbing was an ugly green, not hot pink.
Overall the trip was fun and the rescue was interesting, but it's not the kind of stuff that
without some help would make good reading.
