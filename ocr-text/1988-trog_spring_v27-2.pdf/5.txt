LETTER OF THE QUARTER
Dear A. I. Cartwright,
Your caving expertise is world renowned. That is why I
am writing to you for advice. Let me begin by saying that I
am a female student who has been very active in the student
grotto. I have also done alot of caving. I am an insatiable
gear junkie which can be attested to by the pack I wear slung
across my chest. Many comment that it is quite large.
. Though I have alot of gear, I am not comfortable with all
of it. Let me relate an incident that happened to me recently.
My companions and I were exiting a cave when we came to a
drop. We all free climbed it on the way in. It was rated as
a 5-9 up climb, but as a down climb it would be rated as much
harder -- at least a 6-9.
The others on the trip rigged a rope and rapelled it, but
I was intent on down climbing. Many have told me that I am an
expert on going down. The climb involved first traversing a
series of naturally formed pools and then descending using a
groove, created by a fracture in the rock, for handholds. I
began going down by first rimming the dams, and then jamming
both hands into the crack -- then making them into fists. My
legs flailed wildly searching for the holds I used on the way
up. Then, I remember looking at the rock. I noticed its color
in the glare of my carbide lamp. Did I want it or already own
it -- the rock or the color of the rock? The darkness above
me called as soundly as the void below. And time, time was
forever at one with the color, also with the darkness which
was its abscence. Knuckles scraping, open skin tasting the grit
and trying to hold, hold onto everything -- rock, color, 1......
darkness, and time. It was everywhere -- everything was
everywhere, especially time. And it was calling -- time, time
and darkness and it promised. Promised to carry me up, upward
and into time, the time of forever. Then it moved, the cave
moved away and left me hanging in darkness and time. Time
betrayed me and I went down, down into the sea of stars.
