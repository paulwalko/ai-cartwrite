GROTTO GRAPEVINE
.
The one all-pervading event in the VPI Cave Club during the past quarter is GCCS
(pronounced "gaawwks"). GCCS is actually an acronym for Giles County Cave Survey, a
small part of the Virginia Cave Survey which is currently underway. VPI's contribution to the
state-wide cave survey is concentrated in Giles County under the chairmanship of Jim
Washington. Much of the cave survey work is true drudgery: surveying and ridgewalking,
but the work gets done -- and club support has been high in more ways than one. Rumor has it
that there may even be an official GCCS T-shirt appearing soon.
"GCCS" has even found its way into the club vocabulary. For the sake of all cavers, here
are the official definitions of "GCCS":
(1) Shit. (as an exclamation). (2) Down. (a rope-call). (3) (when repeated: "GCCS, GCCS")
Off rope. (another rope-call). (4) The name of the cave gods. ("GCCS be praised!") (5)
Shut-up and sit down. (when chanted by more than one person at an obnoxious speaker :
"GCCS! GCCS! GCCS!") Note that "GCCS" as a rope-call is discouraged since it sounds
similar to "Rock!"
In addition to GCCSing, our international cavers have been at it again. Jerry Redder,
Cecile James, Bob & Jean Simonds, Bob Alderson, Chris Amundson, Paul Hess, Paul &
Berta Kirchman, Gary Moss, Don Anderson and Jean Hartman went to Mexico over Christmas
with their native interpreter, Alejandro Villagomez. No one could figure out who was leading
the trips to Golandrinas and the other classic caves. Despite illness, gear failure, and the Bob
& Chris and Jean & Alec lovebirds, everyone enjoyed themselves.
Mike Futrell is our other Mexican caver -- he represented VPI on the Huatla expedition.
While many cavers have been going to really deep caves, John Lohner is climbing Mt.
McKinley. It takes all kinds!
There have been many surprises in the romance department this quarter. One of the
biggest news items is Jenny Ford's engagement to Will Allender. The story broke on the night
of the club's annual banquet, and it seems that we are all invited to the wedding in Morgantown
sometime in July or August of 1989. Being the crass group of people that we are, we'll
probably skip the wedding and crash the honeymoon -- everybody bring three sources of light!
Wedding bells are also in the future for Garrie Rouse. He will be marrying Doug Abernathy's
sister, Cheryl. Linda Oxenreider and Randy Stoutenburgh are getting married on October 22,
and are planning an terrific party/reception. Jackie Redder and Bob Hoell are tying the knot on
the same day with a small wedding. A wedding shower will be held for both couples on
Saturday at OTR. Best wishes to our future couples!
ED Fortney has apparently succeeded in luring an unsuspecting female, named Kim, back
to his apartment. We have seen Ed so rarely since then (except for fleeting glimpses as a
mercenary caver), that he is the odds-on favorite for next year's PW award. Viola Richie and
Mike Futrell are cohabitating in Luray, and Ed Devine and Linda Baker are living together
somewhere in the D.C. megalopolis area. Beth Wichterman and Craig Roberts have gone
separate ways once again, and "this time it's permanent". Or is it? Beth and Philip have dated
a bit, now that Beth is a free woman, but don't expect much to happen there -- Beth plans on
moving on to better things such as graduate school, exotic men, and/or higher adventure.
Joan Johnson moved in with Jim Gamble for three weeks while waiting to start her new
job in Birmingham, Alabama. Jim tells us that Joan was eager to please, cooking meals,
retrieving beers and slippers, cleaning, and doing laundry. We're a bit sceptical because Joan
bought a new car quickly, and we suspect it was to avoid Jim's place. Keith Smith was on the
trail in Alabama, but his crew deserted him. Kay Johnson also has a new job, working at
Newman Library. Arby's loss is VA Tech's gain. People associated with the Cave Club are
taking over the library with the likes of Joe Åªknalis, Carol Zo., Kay, Suzanne Danielson, Bob
Hoell, and Paul Hess working there. Meanwhile, Olver is dropping cavers like hot potatoes.
Mike Frame quit at Olver. He's leaving his wife and going back to Alaska. Doug Bruce is
now "unemployed over 95% of his body", and is in danger of becoming another Donahue
addict. Jean Hartman finished student teaching, and is looking for a job in English as a Second
language. She's working with upward bound students this summer at VPI. Don Anderson
