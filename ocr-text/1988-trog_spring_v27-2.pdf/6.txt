The stars cleared when one of my companions poured water onto
my face and we exited the cave. This brings me to the point of
my letter. The reason I attempted the down climb was because
I don't feel comfortable on a standard rack. I don't like
hanging on a rope with six bars as my only points of contact.
Not until there are eight bars would I consider it being well
hung.
What do you think?

Dear 6-9er,
Experts agree that it's not the number of bars but the
diameter that determines safety.
