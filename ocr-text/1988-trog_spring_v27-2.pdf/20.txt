down there. I wanted to get down there right away. I didn't want to mess
around no more, I wanted to go after him." 3
The tunnel rats were soldiers with a need to live life on the ragged edge. If the VC and
booby-traps weren't around when needed, a tunnel rat could very well improvise a life-threatening
situation. One rat who did so was a demolitions expert named Swofford:
"Swofford just went down there with Ellis and twenty-five cases of C-4
explosive, making some 300 pounds in all. They had to haul the stuff, crate by
crate, through the long tunnel complex and set them scientifically at the same
time. Each case was a foot and a half square, and they were soon physically
exhausted. They they discovered they had not brought enough fuse wire, only
a foot and a half, which would be extremely dangerous to use on that amount
of explosive. Ellis asked him, 'Swofford, is that enough fuse?' and Swofford,
who had seen too many Westerns, lit the fuse with a cigarette, and answered,
'No, you'd better start running now, Elly.' One could not, of course, run
down a tunnel, but professionals did perfect an astonishingly fast if undignified
crawl, which stripped the skin from the elbows and knees. As the two men
shot out of the shaft like a couple of corks, the 300 pounds blew ....
Swofford loved every minute of it." 4

These people fascinated me, and whatever motivated them in their work seems familiar (though
not as radical). What motivates me to enter tight crawls when I'm scared of becoming stuck? What
prompts me to climb walls and traverse pits when I'm terrifed by heights? Simply going from
point A to point B is not enough -- I seek out challenges along the way, be it a ledge to climb up, or
break-down to crawl through, avoiding the path of the person in front of me because there's no
excitement in following a path that has been proven "safe".
There is a caver who once planned to chimney up the outside of Slusher -- all twelve floors.
The idea roused my interest, so I asked how he planned to rig his safety line. He wouldn't use a
safety line, he said: the idea was to test himself. When this conversation had time to sink in, I
understood that the quest for thrills was not an aberration in my psyche -- or a latent death wish.
Instead, it is a need shared by a number of so-called "normal" people.
Admittedly, not everyone feels the need for excitement as intensely as a tunnel rat does. The
army set out to train more tunnel rats using a small, secured tunnel complex with simulated
booby-traps and instructors disquised as VC. The training only produced five rats from fifty
students. The officer in charge of training said, "Most crawled out of the tunnel as soon as they
went in." ) Those who washed out of the training could not enjoy the challenge enough to
suppress their panic.
The authors of The Tunnels of Chu Chi acknowledge that some unusual motivaiton not shared
by all men drove the tunnel rats. "There was more than just an element of perverse satisfaction,
even excitement, at meeting a challenge with such grim rules and such awful codes." O Of one
particularly successful tunnel rat, the authors say, "What kept him there, and in the tunnels, was
that sense of obscene excitement that all men can find in the pit of their souls, but few care to
examine." ? Simply put, the rats, like the caver mentioned earlier, were looking for the ultimate
"test".
A "test" is a confrontation with fear. The tunnels represented a source of fear for tunnel rats --
a fear that got adrenaline flowing, a flow which they needed almost like a drug addict. "The
successful rat had to ... take risks unmatched by anything he would ever meet above ground." 8 I
think, as cavers, we too, go underground, to find fear. The Tunnels of Cu Chi claims "the most
ancient and primeval fear (is) following the quarry into the tiny, enclosed spaces, the dark, the
bizarre creatures, the pits and drop-offs where a mis-step can easily be fatal. And the underground
is home to all of these.
When a person beats a fear, he feel a rush that goes beyond adrenaline. Perhaps the feeling is
an exultation over the conquered barrier. The person has now overcome a limitation and
