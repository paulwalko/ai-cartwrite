Obscene Excitement
As I stood facing the entrance to the first cave I had ever seen -- the first cave I would ever
enter -- I felt the very pleasant gust of adrenaline in my spine. There was no seeing beyond the
reach of the sunlight, and the dark unknown was waiting... It has been some years since that first
caving trip, and it would be many years until my next. The excitement I felt when first staring at
the dark entrance would return as often as I approached a cave entrance. It is a feeling that I have
wondered about; it is a feeling I have seen in other cavers. I wonder where it comes from.
I found the hint of an answer in the book, The Tunnels of Cu Chi, which describes the part of
the Vietnam War that took place underground in tunnels dug by the Vietnamese inhabitants. The
authors spill a lot of ink talking about the American tunnel rats, and I was impressed by their
gung-ho, macho attitudes to the point that I tried to put into writing how much cavers are like the
tunnel rats. I abandoned that idea after reading a psychological profile of the tunnel rats:
"They abhorred drugs, were not obsesssed with sex, and did not gamble.
Most spoke a foreign language, read copiously, and sought solitude rather than
the entertainments of the NCOs' or enlisted men's clubs." I
However, there remains remains one similarity between the two groups, which is the fact that we
go undergound, and do so willingly, if not eagerly.
The Vietnamese were also underground, and The Tunnels of Cu Chi takes the time to examine
their lives in, and use of the tunnel-fortresses. The communist Vietnamese were short on troops,
weapons, and technology. In the tunnels, however, they could be found only with difficulty, and
once found, they could not be out-numbered, nor could the Americans use their wieldy,
sophisticated weapons in a tunnel. The Vietnamese went into the tunnels to take the advantage
from the invaders. Their motive was survival, and they don't interest me.
Tunnel rat soldiers, however, went underground (mostly) voluntarily. They left the safety of
numbers, buddies, superior weapons, and sought an elusive enemy in the constricted underground
tunnel-mazes of Vietnam. They thrived on underground confrontations, and officers were amazed
by their enthusiasm:
"...Short (the tunnel rat) went down to check it out. He went in about thirty of
forty feet and there's a trapdoor that led down to another level. He raised it and
a booby trap went off and the tunnel caved in on him. He was buried, face
down. We crawled down and tied ropes to his feet; we tried to drag him out,
but couldn't. So we had to dig down from the top. He was about twelve feet
down. It took us thirty minutes and was kinda frantic. When we could see his
feet, they were still wiggling. He was getting air because his hands were
below his face. He was semiconscious when we got him out. He went to the
hospital, but discharged himself. The hospital thought he's gone AWOL, they
sent military police looking for him; in fact he came straight back to his unit.
HIs idea of R&R was to join me on patrol. You just couldn't keep that man
out of the tunnels." 2
Something extraordinary motivated a tunnel rat, which is obvious from the way one talked about
his work:
"I loved it. The enemy hit us, and then they went down the holes, and I knew
we were going to get them down there -- what other place were they going to
go -- deeper? I would have gone deeper, too. I enjoyed it very much. I like it
a lot. In fact, when they told me they had a VC down there, I came unglued. I
got over there about a hundred miles and hour .... I wanted to be the first
