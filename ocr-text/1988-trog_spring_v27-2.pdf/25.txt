Climbing Rope is knot Easy
or
Pighole in Excruciating Detail
My original intention was for this article to be on my entire trip to Pighole with Craig
Roberts and Doug Bruce. However, since the trip was long and my writing is far from
brief, I decided to write this piece on the most memorable incident from the trip.
Although the twenty foot arm rappel (where my arm got pinned to the wall right after I
climbed over the edge) was interesting, the 100 foot prussik I did with knots was a heck
of a lot more fun.
The three of us had been in the cave about 5 to 6 hours when we reached the bottom of
Dope's Drop. We all were very wet, quite cold, and (at least I was) rather tired. Craig
was the first one on the rope with his frog system. Within minutes he was up to the top
of the drop. Since I wanted to get my rope climbing signed off on this trip, I went up to
the rope next.
The bottom of Dope's Drop is certainly a fun place to tie knots for climbing rope. In
order to get to the rope, I had to climb up a 45 degree angle slope that eventually
narrowed off to a parabolic end. That was where the end of the rope was. No problem,
right? Well, not necessarily. You see, the slope is covered with about six inches of mud
that has the consistency of very thick brownie batter. Had it smelled really bad down
there, one might have thought that municipal sewers fed into the bottom of Pighole.
After struggling up the slope, I finally reached the rope. Then I began tying my foot
knots. First I put the chicken loops on my boot. After my prussik rope was sufficiently
covered with mud, I began to tie my helical knots on the rope. Doug suggested that the
rope might be slicker than normal due to the mud, and that it might be wise if I put some
extra wraps in my helical knots. When he said that, I thought of what could happen when
I got about 75 feet off the ground. I pictured myself- hanging there when all of a sudden
my knots would start slipping. They would start off slow, but then they would accelerate
faster and faster until I was free falling and then, SPLAT! I would hit the bottom and
become a permanent addition to the cave. Well I didn't want that to happen, so to be extra
safe, or so I thought, I decided to tie 5 wraps on both of my foot knots and my seat knot.
After all of my muddy knots were tied, Doug checked them out and said they were cool,
and so I started that laborious process of climbing on knots.
I slid my seat knot as high as possible, and then I sat on it. (Ed. note -- and the Earth
turns...) Fortunately, the rope stretched only a little bit, and I ended up hanging inches
above the mud. I sighed with relief because I had no desire to sit in cold, wet mud since I
was already cold and wet enough. Then I looked up to see the mighty task thaty lay
before me. The rope seemed to disappear and become engulfed in the darkness. "Well,"
I thought, "it's only 100 feet... But 100 feet is a tenth of 1000 feet... and 1000 feet...well
that's pretty close to a mile." Thinking this, I began the repetitive process of climbing on
knots. I slid my foot knots as high as I could, stood up, I slid my seat knot as high as
that would go, sat down, and repeated the whole procedure again and again and
again... (Ed. note -- I am trying to refrain from commenting. I really am!)
When I was 30 feet off the ground, which was about high enough so that I couldn't
see the bottom, I really began to grow tired. I grunted as I struggled to pull each foot
knot up the rope, one at a time. "How are you doing?" yelled Doug from somewhere
down at the bottom. "Oh just peachy," I replied with a huff as I stood up on my foot
knots. It was at this time I figured out that maybe 5 wraps was overdoing it for being
safe...
At 40 feet I was really wishing that I had tied a better seat. But I was so cold and tired
at the bottom I just wanted to put the seat on and get on the rope. The seat would have
