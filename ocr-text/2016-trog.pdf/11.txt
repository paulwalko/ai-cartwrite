Our Vice President,
Alex Booker. Booker has all the charm, grace, and efficiency of a bulldozer. And that is meant in the best
possible way. There is no social pretense he will not disregard, no interactional wall he will shy from
throwing himself through at full force. He's 31, goddamnit, and he will announce it at loud volumes. He
enjoys drinking, and he hosts parties at the Beaver, which he will also announce, maybe repeatedly, also
at full volumes. Booker has all the honesty of a bulldozer as well - they have nothing to hide, and neither
does he. Everything is on the table, and everything will be smashed.
Our Secretary,
Amy Skowronski. The Amy-est characteristic, the one I almost don't want to share for then others would
know it and openly acknowledge it too, thus ruining the effect is this: Amy's (external) inner monologue.
It's external because she vocalizes it, but in a tone so unassuming that the untrained ear would easily
miss. Their perfection is in their oiliness - they slide past the conversational ignorants into the realm of
cleverly genius material with the slickness of a stick of butter. The hilarity is in their cruelty - they are the
epitome of pure sarcasm, often bitterly mocking. The most glorious moment of the entire scene is in the
assumption that the butt of the comment that Amy was muttering was something friendly and conversa-
tional, rather than some brutal observation about the ignorance of the statement. This is easy to assume,
considering her tone is one of friendly intellectual banter. Beware! This is a facade. The genius (or the dev-
il?) is in the details
Our Treasurer,
Kelly McCarthy. Her comical power derives from her unwavering refusal to indulge in pity-laughter. An
attempt to persuade Kelly into indulging into this kind of thing is like trying to push a piece of breakdown
up a gloopy, muddy slope. There is no budging. In fact, the most likely scenario results in a crushing return
to reality; you are not going to move the boulder, so please, for your own sake, shut up and stop trying.
She will only accept emissions of the finest caliber. Should a sentence of idiocy be emitted from a conver-
sational neighbor, even if it is with the best intentions from the source, Kelly will not refrain from wearing
a look that extends to you both her utmost concern for your intelligence, as well as extreme confusion. It
is a look that earnestly questions whatever mess of a word concoction just escaped the confines of your
mouth, and whether she ought to contact the authorities. You see, Kelly is this way out of concern for you
- or rather, maybe just your brain cells. She's thinking of what could possibly be going wrong in your nog-
gin. Kelly operates under the knowledge that the more stupid things come out of your mouth, the more
brain cells die, and the stupider you get, thus more stupidity is emitted. Kelly's art is in the halting of this
cycle. Once you understand the mechanism, your odds of conversational success with this fine bit of hu-
manity veer into the realm of positive. Good luck. Think of your brain cells.
