BLACKSBURG CAVE RESCUE GROUP RESPONDS TO WEST VIRGINIA CAVE INURY
BLACKSBURG, VA-
On October 2nd at approximately 4pm, an 18 year old male fell and broke his leg
in a cave in Monroe County, West Virginia. He was about 4000 ft into the cave.
One of his companions returned to the entrance around 5pm, called 911, and
called two West Va cavers with rescue experience.
A Blacksburg Cave Rescue Group (BCRG) member was notified by one of the
West Va cavers a little after 5pm, and BCRG notified the Blacksburg Volunteer
Rescue Squad (BVRS) duty officer that our assistance was requested. 15 BVRS
members (14 from BCRG) responded to the scene, while 1 additional BCRG
member ran dispatch. 23 affiliates of the VPI Cave Club (mostly students)
responded to the scene per BCRG request. BCRG and the VPI Cave Club began
arriving on scene around 9pm. The groups worked with local Fire and Rescue
personnel to remove the patient. At the time of arrival the patient was already
packaged in a litter and transport was underway. 14 BCRG/BVRS members
entered the cave to assist with transport, 1 BCRG member remained at the surface
and assisted with incident command. 21 people from the VPI Cave Club entered
the cave to assist. An ER Physician from BVRS assessed the patient underground
and the evacuation continued. The patient was removed from the cave at 1:00 am,
and transported to a local hospital. He was reported to be in a lot of pain, but in
good spirits.
In total there were about 75 responders (including two or three local fire
departments), 57 of whom entered the cave (35 of whom were BVRS or VPI
Cave Club). Blacksburg and VPI crews returned home by 4:30am without
incident.
