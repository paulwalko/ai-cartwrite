Expectation vs Reality of the Cable Ladder Belay
By Samantha McCarter
There's a saying in cave club that everyone always fail the Cable Ladder Belay Test once, or at the
very least, watches somebody fail their first time before attempting it themselves. Having seen
someone fail their test, and then walked through the process, I knew all the steps of how not to kill
the member pretending to be a trainee I would actually contemplate dropping in a regular situation.
At the next vertical session I pleaded with the available members, I went through the motions, said
all my steps out loud, and felt I was destined for success. I was thoroughly coached to not let the
pretend trainee give me any lip. I tied the bowline on a coil, the retraced eight, said the commands.
Let me back track for a moment: every other time I've seen the belay test done, it seemed... effort-
less when it came to actually holding the person. As a smaller person, I never completely appreciate
that for the test, I'd be holding an entire human with a rope wrapped around my body. When the
moment came for my “trainee' to take a slip and
fall from the cable ladder, the incredible burning
across my back seemed to be from nowhere. I in-
stantly knew I failed, but couldn't fathom how so
many parts went wrong. I got a rope burn, the
rope slipped through my hands a few feet has |
fought to grasp it and my left arm simply followed
behind my back as my “trainee' plunged to his
death from the short distance. After hearing a
bunch of shit from the other people on the
platform, we revitalized my dead 'trainee' and
tried again to figure out what went wrong. This
time the zombie 'trainee' eased his weight slowly
off the ladder and while I was mentally prepared
for the shock this time, my body bulked as I
crossed the break rope across my chest and felt
No belay no delay
the weight compress the life out of me. It was at
this point that I realized I physically couldn't do it.
I physically couldn't top belay someone heavier
than me with a body belay. Disregarding my im-
properly thin shirt, the crashing fire python in
rope crushed my kidney, spine, and ribs. We
switch to a munter hitch and while my bicep
burned as I took slack out, I was able to support
his weight and the zombie 'trainee' was able to
hobble away.
So if you're of a smaller stature, be cautious.
There's more to top belaying than following steps.
