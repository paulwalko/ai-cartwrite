Hope set the first station most of the way up
the dome, on a large rock at a break-over in
the climb. Nothing like setting stations while
on rope. Our survey designation for the day
was decided to be MMS, for Mad Max Sur-
vey – a nod to the ‘Thunderdome' theme (and
Max' for Maxwelton!). Thunderdome turned
out to be 90ft high, from floor to ceiling, alt-
hough the climb itself was only about 55ft.
The third station, MMS3, got us to a safe
point at the top of the dome, and gave us a
good setup for continuing into the HUGE pas-
sage taking off to the south. To the north,
across the dome, you could see the stream
passage from which the waterfall issued.
Above the waterfall, it looked like a large canyon took off to the north. This passage was only accessible via a
steep ledge on the right, one that would have to have a bolted traverse line installed in order to do safely. At
this point we split up the team. Eric would put in the traverse line to the waterfall lead with Tony belaying,
while Dave, Hope, and I would survey to the south. Hope was point and back sights with a second DistoX2
(yes, we had two DistoX2 instruments – it was great!). Even though this was new virgin passage, I still
moaned and groaned a tiny bit being the sketcher. Passage this challenging with this much breakdown is hard
to draw! I quickly got over it and into an awesome sketchers groove, though.
After a few stations, we came to the short climb down where Tony and Eric had put in a hand line and nail to
make the way back up a lot easier. The floor below the climb down was covered with large pieces of break-
down with lots of space in between. There were little cracks
and spaces where you could see down a good ways. The east-
ern side of the passage was covered with flowstone with a
good portion of the rock welded together by wet calcite flows.
Down on the left and in the back of a short crawl was a flow-
stone covered crack which led downward for a good 15 to 20
feet, where it looked like it opened back up into a room or
passage. You could also hear active water and when a rock
was dropped, there was a pleasant splash. But the crack was
too small to fit through. Digging would also be difficult as the
walls creating the small crevice were made of flowstone.
Hopefully there is another way in.
Continuing south, it soon became obvious that we were actu-
ally in a large breakdown room instead of an actual passage.
We pushed and surveyed up into both corners of the room but
there was no way onward. However, along the western wall of
the room, behind some breakdown, we found a pit, which led
to a very nice looking tall phreatic canyon which was 10 to 12
