curved surfaces (i.e. the bars on a rack, or the curves of a figure 8). The normal force in this case is de-
rived from the load on the rope and the geometry of the device itself. The diagram below details the geo-
metric specifications of the forces at work:

To spare the reader the pain which is mathematical proof, and to summarize what is happening, the
basic equation is as follows:
T2=T MB
There is a difference in the tension through the continuous rope whichh increases exponentially as the con-
tact angle increases. If u is considered constant through the rope, then the only way to increase or de-
crease resistance is to add or remove surface contact. This is done by either adding a bar or pushing the
bars together on a rack, or changing the path of the rope through a figure 8, (specific examples to follow).
Rack Friction
In the case of the rack, both adding
bars and pushing them together cre-
ates a larger contact surface. Starting
from the right, total contact angle is
shown to be 315º. Adding two bar
adds an additional 245°. Keeping the
same number of bars, but pushing
them together adds 240° of additional
contact! From start to finish, the dif-
ference in tension has increased by
775%, which demonstrates the high
level of safety and control provided
by the rappelling rack.
