BANQUET
The pre-banquet party was hosted by Sandy Knapp and Philip Balister, who graciously let us string a
pi√±ata up in the tree outside and beat the snot out of it. This year's Banquet was held at 135 Jackson
St, where there were multiple Large Cans of adult beverages, delicious food provided by Calvin Long
with The Cellar, and a great presentation about Culverson Creek Cave from Bill Balfour.
