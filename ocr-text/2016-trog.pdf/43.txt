Forgetting the Surveyed Past
Shining an Invisible Light Underground
By Eric Lee Hahn
Cave surveying is a phrase most cavers are familiar with. Without a cave survey, a cave map
would be very difficult, if not impossible to accurately create. Throughout this article we'll talk
about the evolution of surveying techniques/equipment, where it may be going, and what could
be lost.
The Survey
A cave survey can be thought of as a point to
point route through a cave. While this point
to point "survey" of the cave will get you
through the cave, it will not give you a clear
picture of what the cave actually looks like.
This is where the actual cave map comes into
the picture, but let's make sure we under-
stand what the survey process is first.
Some of the equipment needed for surveying
include a compass, clinometer (fancy angle
measuring device), measuring tape and laser
distance meter, paper, pencil, sketchbook or
camera, and of course cavers.
As cavers move throughout a cave they take
different measurements at selected survey
points and record the angle, distance, and
orientation of each point relative to the last.
Though this is a tedious process of measur-
ing, re-measuring, sketching or photo-
graphing, and recording data at each survey
point, the cave map would be impossible to
make without it. Using all of the data record-
ed at each point a point to point route is
drawn to create a preliminary cave map.
The Map
The actual cave map that most people are familiar with reading is created by using the cave
survey as a starting point. Through comparing the sketches (and sometimes photographs) tak-
en at each survey point, a map can be draw to visualize what the entire cave actually looks like;
sort of like a cartographer mapping a coastline.
Grading Systems
While no cave is the same, no surveying run done by cavers is ever usually the same either.
The BCRA (British Cave Research Association) grading system for line surveying was created to
