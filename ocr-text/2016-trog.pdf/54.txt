Maxwelton: Beyond Thunderdome
P
By Nick Socky
Resurveying caves is a lot of fun in my opinion, but sometimes it's not the most rewarding thing. You
do not get the glory of being that astronaut caver, because—in this day and age— you are more than likely just
cleaning up “The Firsts” crappy job of mapping the caves. Sometimes, however, we resurvey caves because
we speculate there is more cave then was originally thought! This of course is hard because most of the time,
new cave is in hard-to-reach places or you have to dig. My tale is a story of the perseverance it takes to find
new cave. They key is to not be let down when you don't but when you do... damn is it worth it.
Slight backstory to the project! Maxwelton Cave of Greenbrier County, West Virginia is one of the
classic caves in the area! There were initially two entrances to the cave: The Cove Creek Entrance and the Air-
port Entrance. Sadly, the airport paved over the airport entrance and a hurricane silted shut the Cove Creek
Entrance in the 1990's. Then in 2004, after several years of digging, cavers finally reopened the cave to the
area in the cave known as Heaven! This was a big accomplishment. One now gets into the cave by climbing a
ladder down a 60ft vertical pipe. The purpose to putting this man-made entrance into the Cave was: 1. To re-
gain access to the cave, 2. Re-survey the cave, and 3. Find new passage in the cave, with much emphases on
the last. Sadly, no real break-through in new cave has happened... UNTIL NOW! It has taken 12 years to find
significant new cave.
I have been assisting in the re-survey of Maxwelton now for about 3 years. I am sure most of you who
read the Tech Troglodyte caught my edition of Downstream Cove Creek that I wrote for the Trog last year!
That was a fun trip, but as I said earlier it's just a resurvey- nothing new found, but projects are projects! Talk-
ing with Greg Springer and my father, Dave Socky, it was looking like we were going to finish up the cave in
probably a year's time. We had a few leads left, but nothing promising. I had been asking around WVACS
where there were some good leads and I heard from Errol Glidden and Larry Fischer that this area of the cave
known as Thunder Hall had decent bolt climb at the end of it. Surprisingly, looking through Greg Springer's
notes on areas that needed resurvey- Thunder Hall needed a re-re-survey due to a few botched shots and some
sub-par sketching
Trip 1: So on Saturday October 10th, Dave Socky, Amy Skowronski, Andrew
Lycas, Joe Calderone, and I ventured to Maxwelton to resurvey Thunder Hall.
The first trick was navigating to this area of the Cave. We got up into the upper
levels trying to find the way into the Thunder Hall passage and we got a bit lost,
of course. Getting lost was good though, because Andrew and I found a very
tight lead that had going virgin cave! We turned around after about 150 feet of
nearly walking passage with the sound of water and cascades ahead. My dad
couldn't fit into the lead and we had other plans for the day, so we made a note to
go back! We finally found our way up into Thunder Hall and it was (is) some of
the most impressive cave passage I have seen in a while! The first section is a 40
feet high dome canyon complex with two 15ft waterfalls you have to climb up.
These climbs are really kind of awkward and terrifying actually, and all of the
good hand holds are in the water so you get soaked. At the top, the passage is
muddy with lots of waterfall air circulation. There was a lot of complaining in-
volved, but we continue to survey and we stopped after about 200 feet at the bot-
