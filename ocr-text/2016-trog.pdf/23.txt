Since I couldn't really think of any trip to write about, I decided to just list a bunch of geology puns. Why do you ask? Because geology
is awesome and so are puns! So, here is the wonderful list of geology puns:

GNEISS CHERT!
Geologists can make your bedrock ;)
Why weren't the geologists hungry? They lost their apatite.
My sediments exactly!
Geologists are down to earth people.

Why shouldn't you lend a geologist money? They consider a million years ago to be recent.
Don't expect perfection from geologists; they all have their faults.
SCHIST HAPPENS!
Want to go behind that outcrop and get a little boulder?
Geologists will date anything.
Geologists don't wrinkle, they show lineation!
One tectonic plate bumped into another and said... "Sorry, my fault.”
Studying volcanoes can be tuff.
Geologists are very gneiss people.
Of Quartz, I love geology!
Plateaus – the highest form of flattery.
How do geologists like their drinks? ON THE ROCKS!
TEOLO
GEOLOGY ROCKS!
That's the list, fantastic caver folks! I hope you all enjoyed it! Now, go get some caving done!
