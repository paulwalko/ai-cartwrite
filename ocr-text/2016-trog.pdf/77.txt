From there on out, Horace has made many true
friends who have taken him to new places all over the
country. At the encouragement of his ever-widening
expanse of two-legged companions, Horace expand-
ed his photography and modeling career to the
aboveground world.
To this day, Horace enjoys his time living with a
myriad of different folks. He's a very easy house
guest, as he requires no real food or drink. In fact, his
stay is entirely free of expense to whomever is putting
him up. When he does get out, his popularity and
borderline-celebrity status grants him special
privileges - he often gets one of the best seats at any
event and at least one photo-op with other well-known
guests.
We as a club are respectfully
grateful to have Horace as our co-
hort and look forward to many
years of tomfoolery with him. How-
ever, in the event of his falling
down a pit that no one wants to
rappel, we'll just buy a new Horace
from Dick's Sporting Goods.
HA - dicks.
