Helictites and the Great White Way
By Randolph Colby
This February I was lucky enough to go caving in the Norman half of the Bone-Norman system with a
great group including Dave C and Spotty Dog. The trip was a wonderful time, and even though it only
took about 5 hours, we saw a lot of cool passage. This included a room the size of a small perfor-
mance hall not far from the entrance as well as a nice stroll through a stream that was sometimes
waist deep! At one point our glorious leader Tommy Cleckner poured out some boot water he had
been marinating his foot in onto Spot. As cold and exciting as all of this was, the most impressive
part of trip was a passage known as The Great White Way.
The Great White Way was somewhere around a quarter mile long, and was covered in both calcite
crystals and helictites, as well as some small hairy crystals. The helictites grew in crazed shapes and
looked as if they would break at the slightest touch, so we were careful to keep our muddy hands
away from them. This was my first time seeing helictites, and I was confused as well as impressed,
as they bend and twist into strange shapes with seemingly no respect to gravity. Soda straws, stalac-
tites and stalagmites all grow straight up and down. So why not helictites? I wanted to find out.

It turns out that helictites form in a very similar way to soda straws. Normally, a soda straw has a
small capillary in the middle that allows water through at a fast enough flow rate to form a drip on
the end. This drip dangling off the end evaporates and leaves behind calcite, allowing the soda straw
to grow. The fact there is enough water to form a droplet is important, as the droplet moves to the
lowest point, allowing the soda straw to grow straight downward. In helictites, there is not enough wa-
ter to form a droplet, and the water evaporates at about the same rate as it is excreted [1]. This
means that gravity no longer plays such an important role in the direction of growth, and other varia-
bles such as wind or impurities in the crystal can decide the shape of the helictites [1, 2]. Water flow
may pick back up and again allow droplets to form, which leads to interesting cases where a helictite
will suddenly have a vertical section. We were lucky enough to see some examples of this, and it was
exceptionally neat (See photo 4).
