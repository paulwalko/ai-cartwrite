because of the long tall narrow canyons with breakdown that needed to
be surveyed and with the number of people, it was also not very comfort-
able. Because Beth and Jenn were getting cold, they decided to explore
ahead and find the Candle Room. The rest of us eventually encounter flag-
ging laid out on the path leading down to the Candle Room. Because we
were also cold we decided that this was an old survey and we tied into
some of the old flagging. Andrew and I were left behind to finish sketching
and eventually we decided to join everyone else in the Candle Room. We
had surveyed 15 stations and 181.02 ft. So yes full of short shots and it
was a bit slow. It was later determined that the flagging was not the sur-
vey we were trying to tie into, but apparently route flagging left behind by
previous visitors. So a return trip is needed to complete the survey.
For those who have not been to the Candle Room, it is a very large room!
It is probably about 50 to 60 feet tall and over 100ft wide in places. You
can also tell where during high water a large stream flows
through the middle of the room. Most of the Candle Room
was covered with a thin coating of fine dry silt, which extend-
ed well up the breakdown piles 30 or 40 feet above the
stream channel, evidence of occasional significant flooding.
At 6 pm we all explored around the room, took some pic-
tures, and had a bite to eat. We then turned around and
headed out. Because the climb wasn't “true" vertical, a single
top ascender worked really great, but still took time for all
climb. We got back through the Frothing Slosh at around
8pm. It was much more enjoyable heading out. The amount
of caring how slimed we got decreased due to the fact we
were on the way out. I recall “penguining” through the pas-
sage several times! At the exit of the Frothing Slosh, due to
Beth's emphatic use of very adult vocabulary, we all decided
to take the long way out via the “Downstream Loop" to see some more the cave, including Dave's Lake.
We started our way down Slippery Creek and we started sliding everywhere! It was especially amusing listening to all
of the noises that Jenn was making as she was moving through the passage. They were and entertaining mix of
grunting and straining and hysterical laughing. We hit the joint controlled stream canyons while following the water
and then the passage started getting lower and lower. Tony had made a wrong turn and we were headed down Last
Hope Siphon! Tony maintained the he purposely extended the trip to ensure we met the 12 hour minimum. We didn't
believe him. Grumpily, everyone turned around and we found the proper turn to get to Dave's Lake. At the approach
we all took a running start and went for a quick swim! It
was cold deep water, but thankfully short lived. Very
slowly and exhausted like, we headed up Sneaky Creek,
made it back to the Pool Room, the Lake Room and all the
way back to Sand Canyon at about 12:00am. We spent
some time taking a much needed group photo at the old
sand canyon camp and then moseyed our way out of the
cave. We exited the cave right around 12:30am for a 13.5
hour trip, to encounter woops and cheers from those
around the fire, happily greeting us because they did not
have to rescue us. Several of us then proceeded to the
cozy hot tube, where we relished in the warmth and hap-
piness of such a great cave trip.
