feet wide and heading off in a southwesterly direction. The pit measured out to be about 38 feet deep and
would require a rope to get down. Unfortunately, we didn't have any rope left! Guess we will have to return
here! After finishing up the survey, we decided to name the room “The Coliseum” because of its size, and as a
reference to the ancient battle arena - still playing on the ‘Thunderdome” theme. We then made our way back
to the top of the dome where Eric was just finishing up the traverse. He had made it all the way to the lead, but
ran out of bolts for the last little bit. Only one more bolt will be necessary, so it will be necessary to carry in a
drill one more time. However, Eric reported that the lead looked really good.
By this time, it was getting close to 10pm, which we had agreed would be our turn-around time. It took Eric a
while to clean up the traverse line, and after re-working the rig point at the top of the first waterfall to make it
safer, and then getting all the way out of Thunder Hall, it was a little after midnight. We also placed a rope,
instead of webbing, at the entrance to Thunder Hall. Currently, this area of the cave has a total of 4 ropes being
used: one to get down into Thunder Hall, one rigged in two places to get to Thunderdome, another rigged in
two places to get to the top of Thunderdome, and one acting as a traverse line to get into the large canyon. We
plan on replacing the 9mm rope going up the 60ft drop with a 10mm rope, and we are also going to bring an-
other 100 feet for the canyon drop at the southwest end of The Coliseum. Maxwelton has suddenly become
one of the more vertical caves in the area with potentially 155 feet of vertical work, just in this area! It was a
16.5 hour trip.
So it took a total of 4 trips totaling 56 hours of caving, over 20 bolts, set and 155 feet of rope to get to the top
of Thunderdome AND it was worth it. We plan is to return sometime in the near future and continue both of
the leads which (hopefully) will go for a long time! We are about 100 ft above all known cave in the area, with
a lead going down again, and one that is following the water up—and they are large leads too! So finally, after
14 years of resurvey, a big breakthrough in Maxwelton has finally been made. Hopefully it will continue for a
while.
