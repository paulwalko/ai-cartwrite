NEW RIVER CAVE KIOSK
After months of planning and organizing,
the New River Cave kiosk is up and
complete! Thanks to the efforts of many
hard-working individuals, the final result
is impressive and professional.
Thank you to the Cave Conservancy of the
Virginia's as well as volunteers from the
Blue Ridge Grotto, New River Grotto,
WVACS, and those of VPI who came out.
A special thanks to Jason Delafield,
Joe Zokaites, and Ray Sira.
