Why I Cave
By Deirdre Conroy
Black all around, so dark its suffocating.
Wedged in on all sides. Sharp popcorn under
knees and elbows, crawling along in
the most grim of states. Shoving through
breaks in the rock with unlikely and unfriendly
dimensions. Testing the laws of body contor-

is the head rush, crawling out exhausted,
happy, mentally victorious. I was blown
