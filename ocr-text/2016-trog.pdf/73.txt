When rappelling on a figure 8 device,
simply changing the angle of the rope
using one's brake hand can significantly
increase or decrease resistance, in this
case by 49%. If increased resistance is
needed in an emergency, the increased
contact area and high u value acquired
by pulling the rope under the leg creates
a brake force greater than that of stain-
less steel.

Total angle = 540 = 3 A
Total angle = 630 = 3.51
T, = T,/15.6
T= TG/10.5
In the cave, the most advanced knowledge of ropes and friction is useless if a rappel device is used incor-
rectly. There is no substitute for training, and vertical cavers should be well versed in the use of the
equipment they intend to use underground. One point that should be stressed: TECHNICAL
KNOWLEDGE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR EXPERIENCE.
Author's note: In an attempt to disguise the lack of actual effort that went into the composition of this
piece, I was sure to over-explain the subject matter and include completely superfluous verbiage while
intending to lend myself the dubious fa√ßade of credibility. To exacerbate this point, I've taken pains to
make this aside exceptionally obnoxious.
