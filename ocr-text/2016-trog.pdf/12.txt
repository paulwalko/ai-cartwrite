PICNIC
It was a beautiful weekend for Picnic. The weather
cooperated, the food was delicious, the libations
flowed liberally, and the fire was huge.
On Saturday, a few people went caving! I'm sure
it was a blast despite sweating out the alcohol
from the night before and making the cave smell
like a bar.
The golf was-of course, in full swing.
And if you looked closely, you could see that
there was a PBR in the cup holder of that
Jeep dragging a bramble bush behind it
while four-wheeling through the hills.
