on the ceiling and floor, like
gypsum spiderwebs, or like
someone sneezed gypsum
cotton candy everywhere. In
this same passage, Andrew
Lycas was almost crushed
by some flaked off pieces of
ceiling. Thankfully, he was
able to carefully maneuver
out of the way and let the
ceiling fall in a more con-
trolled fashion. We used a
lot more caution when we
caved back out through
this section of the cave.
As we headed out, I
noticed a speed deficit due to pain from our poor Megan's knees. Volleyball knee-
pads are terrible for Windy Mouth, and we needed to get out quickly, so I decided to
switch kneepads with her, since I have done this cave before using bad kneepads
and figured I could handle it (for the record, I DO NOT recommend caving Windy
Mouth without kneepads. Rolled up socks are definitely NOT a good substitute, ei-
ther). Turns out I was able to handle it, but only because I was distracted by the
pain in my feet from wearing boots that were just a bit too snug. By the time we ex-
ited the cave, I was worried about twisting my ankle, my toes felt abused, I had an
awful blister on the back of my right heel, and my feet were cramping pretty badly.
About 2 minutes away from the cave I decided
I would rather die than continue wearing the
shoes (and if I continued wearing them, on
that hike, I just might've died) so I removed
my right shoe and as soon as my foot was set
free, I felt a thousand times better. Did the
rest of the hike with only one shoe, wishing I
had taken those damn boots off earlier, and
swearing up and down that the shoe I was
carrying would burn a nasty death soon.
The total survey for our tea was about
1022 feet and 32 stations, and considering we
were using instruments and tape, we felt
quite proud of ourselves. I counted about 13
bats for the trip; a dozen on the way out of
the cave, and one that flew past us on the
way in. We caved for 9.5 hours.
