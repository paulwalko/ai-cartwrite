No Morimos
By Madeline Williams
What! Caving! In the Amazon! With my MOM. What a treat! Who needs to wear boots
and synthetic clothes? Not my mom-she has suede loafers and only packed jeans!
Gloves? NO! Headlamps? HAH, we have that old pen light my dad bought to bring his am-
azon order to the required $30 for free shipping. Who needs helmets?! We don't we have
fragile skulls and weak eyesight! LET'S GO.
OH MY. First thing we see is South America's classic scorpion-spider. Oh Ecuador,
you sure keep things lively. My mom overcomes claustrophobia while I lithely skip from rock
to rock, avoiding the raging stream my mom is sloshing through at waist level. Our guide
Gary the Ecuadorian laughs while he tells me in Spanish we really shouldn't be here. The
nearby town had flooded just 12 hours ago and all those planks and bricks and trash we
saw in the street on the way here was debris and destruction from it. HAHAHAH. Man, what
a RUSH. I'm sure we're safe downriver from the town-- protected by 12 hours of time, half
a mile of rainforest, and the fool-proof security of no one knowing we're underground.
Whoops. The stream passage is now so high I have to put my pen light in my mouth
and wade neck deep, illuminating the way for my nearly-retired mom and dumbass Gary
who forgot HIS light (but sure had his waterproof camera). He rattles off the same indige-
nous story he has for everyone while my mom struggles to stay above the waterâ€”that the
first part of the cave is black and the part we're now entering is white because we're no
longer in indigenous hell. We've realized by this point in our weekend that Gary hates his
job.
LIGHT. We ascend.
Gary gifts my mother with
a crown of ferns, forces
us together for a photo,
then rips it away from her
to give to the next gringos.
He calls me Mackenzie. I
felt adequate amongst
these spelunkers.
