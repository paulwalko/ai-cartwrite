dark-adjusted eyes and sniff the fungal mess of the carbon world with confusion
before clicking back into civilized-human mode.
It has a sneaky way of getting under your skin. In the beginning I couldn't under-
stand why people would subject themselves to 12+ hours in the dark, or volunteer
for sketchy climbs, or hop down into canyons they hadn't before seen the bottom
of. At the same time, I also couldn't explain why I kept signing up for trips and at-
tending vertical sessions. Caving can be
sneaky that way. It only becomes apparent
how important it's become to you when you
spend a weekend going through the motions
of a civil human being and realize all you re-
ally want to be doing is getting underground.
Along with the regular urge to frolic along the
adult subterranean playground, the explora-
tion bug creeps in. The yearn for discovery,
the drive for undiscovered beauty. It's a pret-
ty powerful thing. Coinciding that, the
knowledge that the passage in front of you is
one that has never before been seen by man
is pretty mind-blowing. The realms of un-
charted territory on the earth seem to be-
come smaller and smaller in this day and age,
driving the adventurous to lengthier ends to
experience the undocumented. Although
there are no shortcuts in caving, that's what
it offers in itself. Instead of paying millions to
launch yourself into the cosmos or spending
weeks diving to the bottom of the ocean, you
can buy a light and a helmet, borrow a Disto
and some instruments, and meet the same
end. We're a curious species, and caving feeds
- and fuels- that inquiry for the unknown.
In an era when people, lives, and technology
are constantly changing- new jobs, new
phones, new equipment- there's stability in the knowledge that the hidden passages
have existed quietly for centuries, waiting for the light of curious eyes. No matter
where the humans go, the rocks remain. There's comfort in the familiarity of that
one foothold that calls out during every trip through a certain passage. Of course
rocks dislodge, and break down, and dissolve, but for the most part these things re-
main solid. In a constantly evolving, ephemeral world, there's solace in that perma-
nence.
There's also something to be said about the culture and the people who make up
the lifeblood of caving. There's a prominent brotherhood, an ingrained comradery
