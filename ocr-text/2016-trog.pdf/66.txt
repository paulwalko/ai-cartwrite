built through pushing each other through
the suffering to share the glory of scooping.
And this is no nonsensical thing; the pre-
tenses and the social scripts all go to shit
(as they should) when you're in a cave and
your life is in this other persons hands. The
petty things all fall away. One of the coolest
moments from my introduction to caving
was hearing the celebratory woops and wel-
coming howls roll across the valley as the
lights of a 13 hour trip flickered their way
out of the cave entrance under a blanket of
stars. There was genuine enthusiasm and
passion to hear the trip stories, to experi-
ence it vicariously. That's a pretty cool
thing.
The memories built through these kinds of
experiences in the caving world are the ones
that the little nagging voice in the back of
the brain wakes up for, yelling "Pay atten-
tion! These are the ones you'll want to re-
member." The glow of headlamps across
white draperies, The Forest Room in New
River, Heaven in Maxwelton, The Great
White Way in Bone-Noman. Rappelling off
the Empire Ledge, feeling extraordinarily
insignificant, like a candle lowered into the
home of some giant LOTR-worthy creature.
Guitar strings, traditions, and countless
opportunities for bad puns and innuen-
dos. The flicker of firelight on the faces of
friends. Groveling out of grim crawls into
expansive boarhole. Laughter echoing
away into the night. The things that origi-
nally piqued my interest, are the same
things that have kept me hooked.
