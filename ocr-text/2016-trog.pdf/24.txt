ELMT - A History - Sort of
A collaboration of Ed Loud (owner, ELMT®) and Richard Cobb
A long time ago, in a land far far away...
OK, time out. What's that you say? Pritchard
Hall is not far far away? No, trust me on this,
you have no idea. If you were not yet born
when this story takes place, then it is far far
away from anything you know. To begin with,
it was all male – Animal House had nothing on
Pritchard. During a school year the “Pit” (the
center courtyard) would fill up with junk, furni-
ture, and even, at least once, an upper floor
coke machine (it is still a mystery how they got
it through a window). Janitorial staff were (justifiably) afraid to enter when residents
were in residence, so nothing was removed except on breaks. One night (in 1979) I was
walking between Die Quick (aka Dietrich) and Pritchard, when there was a tremendous
explosion, and the ground literally shook. Residents who had windows facing the Pit
said that night became day in the Pit in a bright orange glow. I don't recall a single po-
lice car showing up to investigate. That's how far away that time and place were.
So, ... far far away – there lived a caver, little Ed Loud. Little Ed Loud loved the 25
cent pitchers (32 oz) at Pizza Hut's Happy Hour. Perhaps you can see where this is go-
ing. Maybe the story is best told by not-now-so-little Ed Loud himself:
“I am pretty sure the first ELMT had to be winter quarter '70 or Spring quarter '70.
... I was rooming with Guy Turrenne on 3rd floor Pritchard. I think it may have been
3044... in any event the hallway straight in from the entrance facing AJ. It was a
room facing the airwell [the Pit]. The nearest restroom was up the hall towards the
entrance then left and right into the bathroom. One night I flew off the upper bunk
and pinballed to that restroom...I think I hit the stall 3 or 4 from the left. Apparently
it was rather epic. Someone after that vandalized the stall to read Ed Loud Memorial
Toilet on the stall door. That was it. There are other sordid details but that is
enough.”
Normally, that would have been the end of a familiar-enough story. Except it wasn't
the end. Ed continues:
“ELMTs got put all around Tech. I dropped out and returned in late 1972. By then
someone had spray paint stenciled "Another Ed Loud Memorial Toilet" on the outside
wooden door of a 3rd floor Pritchard john (not the original one). I always thought the
cool part was "Another". I got back into Pritchard with a non-caver roommate who
had lived there a while. Imagine how he felt when his new roommate was [the] Ed
Loud whose name had been on the hall john for a while. The janitors did not remove
the graffiti... must have thought it was official.”
