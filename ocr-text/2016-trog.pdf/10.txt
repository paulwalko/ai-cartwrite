MEET THE OFFICERS!
You see them at the meetings, but how well do you really know them? The wonderful Deirdre Conroy
kindly took the time to imbibe some beverages and write up little snippets about each of our wonderful
officers in case you haven't met them yet.

Our President,
Tommy Cleckner. An inebriated Tommy is a Tommy in rare form. You know he is drunk when there are no
holds barred. For example, if a socializing neighbor says a mildly dumb or clueless statement, within the
head of our President an evil, miniature (as it's condensed in miniature size) Tommy begins heating the
brand in the derisive flames of the forge. There's a slight smile on his face- it's purely selfish amusement,
for his very own enjoyment- and his eyes are far away. Finally, the scorn is ready for application. Tommy
has the cool confidence of an apex predator as he slowly turns his head toward his poor, unassuming vic-
tim. His grin is wide, his chin raised, cheeks rosy from alcoholic ambrosia to his mockery, and his eyes are
bright with the expectation of your humiliation. In the moment just before brandishing his weapon of
choice- carefully articulated verbal abuse- he makes sure to look you in the eyes as he moves in to punch
you squarely in the genitalia.
