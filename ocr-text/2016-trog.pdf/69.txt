school ring today. Its condition looked essentially new, but to our surprise the date was from 1956. In
the cave we could see the name of the school and the initials inside. I slid the ring onto my pinky, and
we continued our survey.
The next day I set out to ask the internet who JCP was, expecting it to answer, “I have no idea”. But
it is startling what you can find. First I learned a bit about Stewartsville schools, “Stewartsville has
maintained a public school since 1850. The one room log building was located on the Mitchell place, and in
1900 the site was moved to the Drewry farm. There, a two-room log schoolhouse was first built. In 1904, a new
site was found, and a two-room, frame house was built. In 1912, a two-story building of four rooms with an
auditorium was constructed and provided instruction for grades 1-7 and the first year of high school. At this
time, there were three instructors at the school. In 1914, the first class graduated from Stewartsville School. In
the fall of 1930, Bedford County consolidation of schools began, and students began to come to Stewartsville
from other schools. The fourth year of high school was added. The 1934 school year saw ten teachers and a
principal. The school also became a fully accredited high school by the Commonwealth of Virginia. Enrollment
in 1936 was 270 students.

In 1964, the further consolidation of schools in the county resulted in the building of Staunton River High
School. This left Stewartsville as an elementary school with grades 1-7.
JCP was the last senior class to graduate from Stewartsville High School. I wondered if there was an
electronic copy of the 1956
yearbook online, and I
found one on a website
called ClassMates.com.
There was only one match
to the initials JCP, one Mrs.
Josey Carleen Price. Armed
with this name, a google
search led me to Ances-
try.com showing a marriage
record to a Mr. Robert
Lewis Hayden. Adding his name to the search led me to an obituary stating the two lived in Wash-
ington state and Josey now went by Carleen Hayden. Her new name led me to her Facebook page, but
this turned out to be mostly a dead-end, but did serve to make me think I had a good chance of find-
ing her and speaking with her. The next result after the Facebook page was for a church in Longview,
WA listing her as the president, which included a number. I called and left a message, saying I was
calling from Blacksburg, VA and thought I may have found something that had belonged to her. I
then searched for Robert Hayden in Longview and found their home phone number.
There it was: in just five quick google searches, the owner of the ring. It seemed too easy. Carleen
called me back before I had a chance to call the home phone.
The very first thing she asked me was if I had found her ring. It seemed after all these years the
thought of it had not gone far from her mind. I relayed the story I have laid out above and collected
the details I could from her. She was clearly anxious to see the ring again, offering a reward, and then
offering to pay the post. I declined both but said I would send it ASAP.
I sent the ring with only a request for any stories it may have brought back when she received it. I
sent along with it a copy of the old map and any clippings I could find from her days in the club I
gathered from the Sivtac site. Today I have still not gotten a reply, but I hope she is enjoying having
the ring back as much as I enjoyed finding it and its owner.
