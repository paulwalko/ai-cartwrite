VPI Weekend at BCCS: To the Candle Room Via the Good Way!
November 14th, 2015.
By: Nick Socky
As part of the VPI weekend at Butler Cave, a large number of students journeyed to the Burnsville Cove for a
plethora of sport trips, projects, and digging. Even though I am no longer a student, I would never pass up the oppor-
tunity for a fun cave trip with friends! So I left for the weekend straight from work showing up in my fancy work
clothes, and jumped right into the party! This included singing around the camp fire, consuming of vital beverages, and
of course the playing of Toto on the Bluetooth speakers that were brought. Anticipating a long cave trip the next day
though, I slipped out early and attempted to get some shut eye, but for some reason the melodic voices of Salt and
Pepper kept playing in the back ground on repeat. I angrily went down stairs and shut of the speakers around 3 am.
Surprisingly, I awoke ready to rock and roll! All my cave gear was ready and then we hit the all too well known
"hurry up and wait” that occurs when you have a large group of VPI around trying to figure out what to do in the hung-
over stupor. Eventually the survey team for Butler had been organized and we were on our way! The team included
Beth Mutchler, Jason Delafield, Andrew Lycas, Jenn McGuire, Tony Canike, Nick Socky (me), and Tommy Cleckner. Our
goal was to find our way to “The Good Way”, an alternate route to
the Candle Room that did not involve Neptune's Throw drop and the
slimy Crisco Way canyon. The Good Way does however include a
technical free climb, and we brought rope in with the intention of
rigging a permanent climbing rope in the cave for safety reasons.
Once rigged, we would continue modern survey from the top of the
drop until we connected to a known station in the Candle Room,
which would close a very large survey loop over 5000 feet.
We believed that the Good Way hasn't been dropped for at
least 20 years and that, with the exception of a trip to the Candle
Room exactly one week ago, the Candle Room also hadn't been visit-
ed for 20 years.
We entered the cave at 11:00am and made our way quickly down to Sand Canyon and to the trunk passage!
We reached the Soda Straw Break by the Dry Sumps around 11:40am and the French Passage at noon. Before making
our way up to the Pants Off Crawl from the Pool Room, we ran into one of the other groups, where I was surprisingly
able to fool Madeline Williams into staying to the right instead of the left. She was not very amused with going for a
quick swim, and we quickly departed before we could get smacked. The Pants Off Crawl was fairly "pleasant", only be-
ing slightly wet and if you were small enough you could easily avoid the water by squeezing to the right. The next fun
challenge though was the Frothing Slosh! Because we had 7 people on our trip, passing packs and squeezing up
through the muddy wet stream canyons took quite a miserable while but it was none the less enjoyable! Why else
would we do caving like this if we didn't enjoy it?
After changing out of some wet clothes into warmer ones,
getting a bite to eat, as well as deciding our survey designation of ICP
(Individually Containerized Pickle), we got to the top of “The Good
Way" at 4pm! Of our vertical gear, everyone either made a webbing
harness or brought a small one in. We would share rappelling and
climbing gear on the way out. Andrew, Beth, and Tommy rigged the
pit while Tony, Jenn, Jason, and I started the survey. We tied into
BPA9, and surveyed from the upper part of the drop and down into
the lower canyon section. Once everyone was down the drop, I was
sketching, Andrew shadowed me, Jason Delafield, Tony, and Tommy
played the rolls of front sight, back sight, and point. Jenn and Beth
scouted the route to the Candle Room. The survey was fairly slow
