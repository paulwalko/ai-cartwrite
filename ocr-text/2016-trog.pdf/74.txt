It's A Long Way To The Top
By Beth Mutchler
Rappellin' down a long rope
Into the cave below
Stop to take a photograph
Whoops, there went your croll
Tumblin' down
Gettin' stoned
Gettin' beat up
Broken boned
You get down
See it's cooked
That croll is mangled
It was softer than it looked
It's a long way to the top if you've got a busted croll
It's a long way to the top if you've got a busted croll
If you think it's easy doin' sit and stands
Try movin' all the knots with your hands
It's a long way to the top if you've got a busted croll
Pull out your spare rope
Makes you wanna cry
Sit there and hope
You remember how to tie
Helicals
Get it right
Proper length
Nice and tight
Thousand feet
Up a pit
That's how it goes
And you're getting' sick of it
It's a long way to the top if you've got a busted croll
It's a long way to the top if you've got a busted croll
If you wanna see the stars up in the sky
Look out, keep climbin' high
It's a long way to the top if you've got a busted croll
It's a long way to the top if you've got a busted croll
It's a long way to the top if you've got a busted croll
It's a long way to the top if you've got a busted croll
Well it's a long way, such a long way
It's a long way, such a long way
It's a long way, it's a long way
