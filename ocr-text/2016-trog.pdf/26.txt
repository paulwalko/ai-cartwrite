Skip Whitehurst - “Gary Moss and I made sure there was
an ELMT in the "USARP Hotel", the men's dormitory at
McMurdo Station, Antarctica, in October, 1976. ... We
were going to designate one at Amundsen-Scott South
Pole Station, but the C-130 we were on developed engine
trouble so we couldn't land at the pole.”
LITTLE ED LOUD
WILL GO TO BED SOBER TONIGHT

Ed Loud did not have his first
beer until he was a freshman in
college. While his friends were
drinking Bud and coors, Ed was
drinking Schmidts. He never had
the advantages of other alcoholics
yet his body required up to 3
gallons of the precious liquid
each day to function properly.
And so tonight, little Ed Loud
will go to bed sober ------- ===
unless----YOU HELP: The next
time you are thinking of buying
that loaf of bread or bottle of
milk, think twice and instead
send a check to "SAVE THE CAVERS
FUND". Just 994 will buy Ed a
six pack of Schmidts, (its on
sale at Krogers). So give so
that others may drink. I thank
you and I'm sure Ed does too..

Dale Parrott - “I remember a time long, long ago while
driving from VA to Seattle stopping somewhere I think in
South Dakota. It was a wooden outhouse probably in a
tourist area - and there it was ... ELMT scratched on an
interior wall.”
Rich Geisler -“The roof of the warehouse in Tamapatz
Mexico where we setup base, and on the ridge of the high
Guadalupe mountains of new Mexico”
Ed Loud - "Not sure where I have seen the pic of the vandalized billboard out on the 460
bypass. I know it was [redacted] for one standing in front of it. They changed "Fighting
Hokies" to "Friggin Chickens" but also put ELMT which I wished they had not as that
might connect it back to the cave club via vandalized toilets around campus. I guess the
statute of limitations has expired as they say.”
Jean Cobb - “On every Greyhound bus that I rode between VPI and Connecticut”
Richard Cobb - “The location of the pre-
ferred rig point on the cat walk of the New
River Gorge Bridge was marked in white
paint by Pete Sauvigne (1979) with a
prominent ELMT. It made it easy to find
on even a very dark night”
