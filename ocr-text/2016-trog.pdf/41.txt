creek. At one point the water
was waist deep. By the time we
reached the exit, we had been
caving for 7 hours. One by one
we climbed up the culvert as
wind blew ferociously on us. It's
important to note that the Wild
Cat entrance is actually two en-
trances side by side, A culvert en-
trance which sucks wind into it
and the natural entrance which
doesn't nearly move as much air.
In preparation for getting out in
the cold of night in the snow, we
stashed our clean, dry clothes,
shoes, and winter jackets in the first room inside the natural entrance.
Somehow I was the last to climb out the culvert and race inside the natural entrance to get to my dry
clothes. In the short time was out of the cave my wet clothes started to freeze. That's how cold it
was. I got into the room and changed. I was ready to head back when a member of our trip realized
they did not have dry boots. Peppy decided to put plastic bags on their feet. I thought that we could
make it back to the cars and the WVACS field station faster if I gave them my dry shoes, and I wore
the plastic bags. I thought I was tough and could handle a little cold.
That's how I ended up running through the snow a quarter of a mile on the coldest night of the year
with only plastic bags and socks on. It was below OF with 5mph winds and wind gusts of 15 mph.
After 7hr of caving in a creek, my core temperature was lowered. I had only eaten snacks and proba-
bly could have been better hydrated. I had one thing on my mind when I exited the cave; let's get out
of here as fast as possible. As I climbed over the limestone on the way out of the cave, the bags
ripped some. At first I walked, but I could feel my body getting very cold. I knew something was
wrong. I felt some adrenalin kick in. I started to run. I made it back to the cars shivering. I forced
someone out of the front seat of a car, so I could put my feet over the air vents as heat came out.
Looking back on it, I realized at some point in the trip back to the car that I became hypothermic. I
was not myself for pretty much the rest of the night. When we got back to the field station it took
the whole room of people yelling at me to convince me to take a hot shower. I quickly realized that
there was a problem with my feet. I couldn't feel them completely. Thankfully there were EMTs pre-
sent, and they took a look at my feet and made sure I warmed them up properly. The next day |
spent Valentine's Day at an urgent care. The frost bite was very mild, only one blister. However, the
entire bottom of my feet had frost nip. I am still continuing to lose skin off the bottoms of my feet
now.
The moral is beware of frostbite: it can happen faster than you think. If you are leaving a cave in
winter, know you might be cold and plan for the worst weather possible for when you exit. Don't try
to be a noble badass. Stop and think. In hindsight, there were so many better options that would
have led to more favorable outcomes.
