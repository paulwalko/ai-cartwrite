HORACE THE GREAT HORNED OWL
Horace's earliest memory
from childhood is vague and
revolves around a hate for
pigeons. He felt a special an-
imosity toward said crea-
tures, though - as far as he
knew - he'd had no run-ins or
poor experiences in their
company. His hatred toward
pigeons seemed to serve as
a calling, but over time he
began to question his posi-
tion against pigeons and
similar birdfolk. There was
no one to turn to about his
hesitations and questions except his hu-
man employers. He soon learned that
pigeons were considered pests, and he
was being used to scare off similar nui-
sances. Upon this realization, he resigned
in order to focus on "finding himself.‚Äù
br
He was first introduced to the VPI Cave Club was at
the 2015 NSS Convention in Missouri and therein
found alcohol and cave photography. The latter
served as a creative outlet to express himself, forev-
er changing his life. One caver, Nick Socky, even
created a caving database to record his under-
ground adventures for him.
