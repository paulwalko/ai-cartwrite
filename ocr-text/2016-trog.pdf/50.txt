month, and held at least 15 individuals of the species Homo naledi, representing men, women,
and children of the oldest member of the Homo genus- and at the time of the discovery, a new
species. Such a complete discovery outside of the protective environment of a cave is unlikely.
The bodies' placements suggested they were placed there by relatives after death and are the
earliest records of a burial by humans.
Homo naledi
If you're living on the east coast of the United States, you're probably not going to find perfectly
preserved crocodiles or ancient cave men. However, the caves throughout the appalachians
have very fascinating fossils nonetheless. The sediments left from the ice age have very few fos-
sils in them, but the limestone layers in which caves regularly form can include layers left from
three to five million years ago when Richmond was still part of the ocean. These layers are richly
populated with the clams and oysters that lived in the shallow oceans. Some of the best cave fos-
sils nearby are found in West Virginia, where discovered fossils range from ocean-dwelling mol-
luscs, to massive mammals such as the mastadon, wooly rhino, and giant ground sloth.
Whether you are an archaeology buff or not, keep your eyes on the lookout for fossils wherever
you cave. You never know what you might find, and not every discovery has been made by
someone who was looking for it! Keep in mind that you should never disturb, move, or take any-
thing out of a cave, including fossils. Not only is it illegal, but you could harm the fossil and the
soil context around the fossil which is very important to proper dating and excavating. If you
think you've found something special, take pictures and notify your local speliological society or
club. Happy caving!
