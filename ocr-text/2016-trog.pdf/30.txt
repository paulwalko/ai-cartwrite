Doe Mountain Cave
(or Probably Why I Received Both the Vertical Techniques and Badass
Trainee Awards)
By: Jenn McGuire
Since our President, Tommy Cleckner, did such a good job explaining why I won the awards I did, I
ought to shed some light on it. Also, there are some lessons about experience, knowing your gear,
and other important tidbits to be gleaned from this tale. With that, onward....
Sometime last summer I replied to our President's email soliciting volunteers to dig debris that
was blocking passage in Doe Mountain Cave. I, being ignorant about how difficult digging in the
cave would be, volunteered eagerly. The stream that had been dumping debris into the cave was
redirected during an earlier weekend, so Andrew Lycas and I headed into the cave armed with buck-
ets, hand shovels, and a cable ladder. We get down the cable ladder, down a corkscrew climb, and
take stock of the situation at hand. After poking our heads into some holes and some examining of
the map that was moderately useless so close to the entrance, we settle our limbs and bellies in the
stream and on chunks of uncomfortable rocks and get to it. The debris that had washed included
rocks, dirt, rotting leaves, sticks, and log that was quite well wedged diagonally across the passage
that we determined was the most likely correct way. A few hours of work digging and dragging a
bucket heavy with dirt and rocks yielded a passage that looked almost promising.
It also looked tight.
I stuck my head down the passage and took a few pictures to see if we could (unsuccessfully)
jog the memory of anyone who'd been in the cave years prior. At this point, unsure of whether I, let
alone Andrew, would fit down the passage, exhausted from the digging, and thoroughly soaked from
lying in the stream, we decided we'd reached a good stop-
ping point for the day. The corkscrew climb proved difficult
with my 5'2" reach and worn out arms, but the real fun was
the cable ladder. My first experiences with a cable ladder in-
cluded an indecent amount of cursing. But at last we were
out into the warm summer day.
A couple weeks later, Andrew and I returned with Tommy
Cleckner, the perfect person to send down a passage to get
stuck in! While Andrew and I waited with our buckets and
shovels, Tommy struggled through the passage for several
minutes. Much cursing of the cave and our names was had.
Finally, he made it to the room on the other side of the pas-
sage, but clearly neither Andrew nor I would fit, and neither
did Tommy wish to return through the passage.
We had dug out the wrong hole.
After some examination on Tommy's part, we found a voice
connection... in a spot where we had dumped dirt and rocks
during the last trip. So once again Andrew and I settle into
the chilly stream and fill buckets of debris to open up the
cave. After another couple of hours of work, we break
through and are able to join Tommy in an area that we can
finally stand upright. We meander down the cave to the first
nuisance drop. As we didn't bring our vertical gear, we turn
back, triumphant to have opened up the cave. Once again,
the cable ladder produced much cursing.
The following week I returned to Doe Mountain Cave, along
