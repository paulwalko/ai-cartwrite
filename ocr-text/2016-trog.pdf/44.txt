grade the accuracy and precision of surveys to show how similar surveys could be.
Grade 1 is a low accuracy sketch of the cave done without any sort of measurement.
Grade 2 is usually a grade 1 sketch used to aid in a grade 3 survey.
Grade 3 is a rough magnetic survey where horizontal and vertical angles are measured to
+2.5 ° with distances measured to +50 cm and a station position error less than 50 cm.
Grade 4 is between grade 3 and 5.
Grade 5 is a magnetic survey similar to grade 3 with tighter tolerances. Angles are +1 ° with
distances accurate to 1 cm and station positions to less than 10 cm.
Grade 6 is a magnetic survey more accurate than grade 5.
While there are higher grades above grade 6 we won't get into them here. Feel free to look
more into surveying techniques and their associated grading levels. Some of the higher levels
require a great deal of training and practice.
Errors
Even through extreme diligence when recording survey data small errors overtime can add up
by the time you reach the back of a cave. Only a couple millimeters at the start can compound
to a cave survey being hundreds of feet off in the end. Loop closure can be a way to help re-
duce but not completely eliminate some of these errors. By using alternative techniques to map
points in the cave to known points in space you can "close the loop” on cave maps. One way to
do this is place an antenna at points along the survey route and use a radio above ground to
tag survey points to their global coordinates. Through doing this you can help detect and reduce
survey errors to produce a more accurate map. Yes, this would make surveying the cave take
even longer, but it would be more accurate!
Emerging Technologies
Though surveying is an incredibly important part of cave mapping newer technologies are be-
ginning to replace the old point to point measurement technique. LIDAR, or Light Detection and
Ranging, is a form of photography that uses invisible laser light to capture a picture of points
with distance information for each point. Imagine a picture that doesn't use colors for each
point but a distance away from the camera for each point. These pictures are sometimes called
a point cloud because the distance information of each point can help paint a 3D picture of the
scene that's being recorded.
LIDAR cameras, or sensors, are incredibly accurate today. A plane carrying a LIDAR unit can im-
age the ground thousands of feet below and still have an accuracy of 30 cm or better. Ground
based LIDAR units that are closer to the surface they're trying to map have an accuracy of less
than 1 cm. Think about it for a second, this is an entire 3D picture of the world around the sen-
sor that is more accurate than the width of your finger.
Cave Use
Mapping a cave using LIDAR sensors would not only be more accurate than the tape and com-
pass method but would also produce a 3D map of the entire cave. Mapping a cave using LIDAR
sensors would consist of holding the sensor and walking through the cave using a software
