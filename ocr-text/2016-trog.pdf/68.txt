The Ring of Canoe Cave

In 1956, when Josey Carleen Pace received her high school ring, she had no idea the strange journey it
would make.
In spring of that year she graduated from Stewartsville High School just outside of Roanoke, VA,
wearing a gold class ring with the initials JCP inscribed in it. Shortly after graduation, she followed
boyfriend Robert Lewis Hayden to VPI as he set off on his course of study. While enrolled at VPI, the
two soon found the VPI Cave Club and began to explore many of the caves we still visit to this day.
As times change, so have the popular caves of the club, and in the late '50s and early '60s a common
stop was Canoe Cave. It was in that very cave, in spring of 1962, just before graduation that Josey and
Robert would lose her class ring.
When they first came to VPI Josey and Robert found the VPI Cave Club to be quite an active group.
Robert's studies were a 6-year track that involved a service component that accounted for the two ex-
tra years -- all the more time to spend caving. Josey told me they would go caving every weekend, of-
ten Saturday and Sunday, and there were only two or three trips she could recall in all those years she
did not go on with Robert.
It was on one of their very last trips, into Canoe Cave, that the class ring was lost. In a section of nar-
row passage that connects the entrance descent to the main portion of the cave, the ring become dis-
connected from Robert, its keeper at the time. They knew it had been dropped, although the details of
how are lost to time, but Josey remembers the search lasting over an hour. However, at the end of it
they had nothing to show for their efforts. The cave had the ring, and Josey had sorrow.
Josey and Robert left VPI that spring. Over the next 60 years' time had its way with things. The story
of the ring was forgotten. Canoe Cave was no longer a common stop for the club. And all the while the
ring sat patiently in the dark -- until late on the night of January 13, 2016 when it would find its way
into my hands.
With the threat of a pipeline crossing the path of the cave, a small group of surveyors set forth to up-
date the 1943 map. On one of the final mop-up trips we were working in lower passage that connects
the entrance descent to the main body of the cave. The passage we were in had turned to a breakdown
pile but connected to main route above and I had just watched Philip Schuchardt worm up a path that
looked tight and bothersome,
albeit pleasantly short. As I be-
gan my climb into the worm-
hole I saw something shiny just
off to my right. I grabbed it
without looking much at it, as-
suming perhaps Philip had
dropped something and I would
get to taunt him with it at the
top of the climb.
To Philip's and my surprise, it
was a class ring. I had finally
found gold in a cave! Buried
treasure. At first glance I as-
sumed the ring was more re-
cent. It looked like any high
