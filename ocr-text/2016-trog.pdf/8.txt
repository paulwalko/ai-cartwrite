INTRODUCTION
Come one, come all, to the VPI Cave Club. We'll welcome you like an old friend, the weirder you are,
the better. Meet old farts and young'uns alike, all of whom carry some bomb-awesome stories with
them. We'll take you underground in a heartbeat, unless we get lost in the woods on the way.
We in VPL invite anyone with a sadistic spirit to partake in adventures ranging from
across Southwest Virginia to the other side of the globe. Join us, and you'll see things you'd never see
on the surface world, like remarkably large stalagmites or truly impressive gypsum flowers.
Thank you to everyone who has ever led a cave trip, hosted a speleo seminar, helped with training, or
in some other way been a part of our club. You guys are what keep this group afloat (on a sketchy raft
on Memorial Day weekend). I think our group can be summed up fairly well with a quote from an
unsuspecting newbie: "You guys are a mix of incredibly lewd and strangely heartwarming."
We'll see you soon!
