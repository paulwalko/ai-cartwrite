HOW TO: GET COMPLETELY LOST UNDERGROUND,
FIGURE IT OUT, AND GET ORIENTED.
Step 1: Bring a map. Look at it for a minute. Seriously, just check that shit out for more than
five seconds.
Step 2: Put the map in your pack before you go underground.
Step 3: Enter the cave and start doing your thang, babe.
Step 4: Look at the map to guesstimate where you are in the passage and what direction
you should be moving.
Step 5: Find a survey station or a major landmark near you and locate it on the map. Is it
there where it should be? Cool. Keep caving.
Step 6: Come to a turn in the passage that you didn't notice earlier and take the map out
again.
Step 7: Find another survey station and match it to the one on the map.
Step 8: There isn't supposed to be a turn here. A wall
is supposed to be in front of you right now.
Step 9: Congratulations, you're lost.
Step 10: Continue on in this fashion for two hours, pe-
riodically staring at the map and scratching your head
(swearing is encouraged) because nothing makes
sense anymore.
Step 11: See that the survey stations were old and the
paint had chipped â€“ that one over on that wall actually
says G16, not C16. Eventually come to the realization
that you didn't come in the entrance at the bottom of
the map, you actually used the entrance at the top.
You've been looking at the wrong part of the map for a
very long time.
Step 12: Rotate the map 180 degrees.
Step 13: Find out where you actually are and cave
away.
Step 14: Take a picture with a drowned rabbit.
