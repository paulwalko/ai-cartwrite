FRANCHISE TOILETS? Why not! The
Edward I. Loud Memorial Toilet
franchise was started about three
years ago by none other than the
infamous Ed Loud himself. As he
From a single night of hugging a porcelain throne, the
ELMT Franchise was born and continued to grow. By the
time of Ed's return in late 72, ELMT's had already spread
far and wide. The first mention in the historical record was
the Spring 72 Trog issue, Grotto Grapevine column:
“New ELMT's have been sighted all over the country, one
has been seen in Oklahoma, another at Mammoth Cave,
Kentucky, and there is even a road side one in Campbell
County, Tennessee.'
In the Winter/Spring 1972 (V2 #3) issue of the VAR Region
Record there is an “interview” with the owner of the ELMT
Franchise. From the introduction to the interview:
“The Edward I. Loud Memorial Toilet franchise was
started about three years ago by none other than the in-
famous Ed Loud himself. As he trotted about the U.S., he
spent quite a bit of time on the rim. This gave him a
unique opportunity to conduct close, first-hand inspec-
tions of a good many Roadside America toilets. He grad-
ually developed a taste for high quality facilities, and be-
gan to indicate his preferences with a seal of approv-
al.” (See the accompanying figure for the complete inter-
view).
trotted about the U.S., he spent
quite a bit of time on the rim.
This gave him a unique opportunity
to conduct close, first-hand in-
spections of a good many Roadside
America toilets. He gradually
developed a taste for high-quality
facilities, and began to indicate
his preferences with a seal of
approval. The following is ex-
cerpted from an interview with
Mr. Loud:
EDITOR; About how many Memorial
Toilets are there now, Ed?
LOUD: I would say roughly about a
thousand.
EDITOR; Zounds! I had no idea
business was that good!
LOUD: Well, really it isn't. A
better indicator of how much busi-
ness we're getting is the number
of new franchises per year. So
far this year we are 47 franchises
behind last year. But the ones
we've gotten are good ones.
EDITOR: How do you account for
the dropoff in business?
LOUD: Probably because many of my
best customers just don't give a
shit anymore. For example, Jim
Dawson gave the Convention toilet
franchise to a Roanoke outfit last
summer. There were five units at
the campground that held 55 gal-
lons each. They were filled and
emptied once daily for ten days,
for a total of 2750 gallons.
EDITOR: Wow! 2750 gallons!
That's a lot of shit!
LOUD: It may be shit to you, but
it's bread and butter to me.
In the Fall 1972 issue there is the Grotto Grapevine an-
nouncement of an Ed Loud Memorial Toilet in Bangkok,
Thailand.
In the Winter 74 Trog is an entry under “And Now a Word From Our Sponsors”.
“Little Ed Loud Will Go To Bed Sober Tonight ... unless YOU HELP! ... So give so that
others may drink..."
Then in the Spring 74 Trog there is a piece titled “elmt tours?”:
“In a recent(?) issue of Descent magazine ... it was suggested that anyone traveling
through our area should stop by and ask the VPI Cave Club about Ed Loud Memorial
Toilets... and be sure to be shown one!” [Ed Note: Descent is a UK publication, first
published in 1969 – ELMT's had become known internationally. But so far, none of
the Old Farts has been able to produce a copy of said magazine].
ELMT's had become a phenomenon. There were so many placed around the world that
they will never all be known. A query of Old Farts got a partial list though:
Ed Loud - “I know I put ELMTs (though for a while I prided myself on never having
made one myself) in TX and CA and a few bars in D.C. I found one in Burress Hall and
