The Tech Troglodyte is published each semester (assuming that people bother to submit articles,
which they often don't) by the VPI Cave Club, a student grotto of the NSS. All submissions, subscrip-
tions, inquiries, donations, and comments should be sent to: Trog Editor, VPI Cave Club, P.O. Box 558.
