LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT
This year has been another good year for the cave club. The caving is the best it has ever been in my
brief time with the club. In the last year, we re-established access to Doe Mountain Cave, made new
friends with the Butler Cave Conservation Society, expanded our involvement with the West Virginia
Association for Cave Studies, and have done some sporting trips into some of the less traveled gems
underneath our little slice of caving heaven. It's been really exciting to see more people getting excit-
ed about going on a survey or heading to West Virginia for a weekend. And let's not forget our good
showings at Spring VAR, YTR, OTR, and our plethora of other regularly scheduled debauchery. There
was a strong infusion of fresh blood into the club this year, and our previous additions are still keep-
ing things lively. They're good cavers, and most importantly, knowhow to have a damn good party.
Personally, I can't wait for more of them to get their member numbers (you know who you are!) so
that I can continue to shirk more of my club obligations. On tat note, I'd like to thank everyone who
has stepped up and made so many great memories possible. Here's to a good year and many more!
Belligerently yours,
Tommy Cleckner
