HOW TO: KNOW IF YOU'RE ON AN ALL-GIRLS TRIP
1. Look down.
2. Someone broke a nail.
3. Someone brought obnoxiously tinted lip balm (â€œOh,
dude, you look like Barbie").
4. There was dancing whenever the passage allowed for
it. And also when the passage didn't allow for it.
5. When someone asked if anyone had an extra sports
bra and/or hair ties, an entire chorus answered them.
6. After one person went off for a pee break, everyone
else had to, too.
7. The mood of the group changed five
or more times over the course of
the trip.
8. There was a serious discussion
about the pros and cons of various
forms of contraception.
9. There are wine coolers in the post-trip
beer bucket.
10. Someone complained about their boobs
and/or their birthing hips not fitting through a
passage and how yes, they squish, but only so
much.
