SPELEORATA
Written by Jim Washington, 1983
Cave softly amid the pretties & nasties & remember what peace there may be in rappelling. Circumvent ugly
stream crawls unless you are truly masochistic. Carry first aid. Encourage membership in the NSS, & write
for the publications though cave politics be for turkeys. If a person appears to be in doubt of who he is, he
may be a speleopolitician. Beware. Consider that if two rights & a wrong go to a dead end, a right & two lefts
may not get you back where you remember. Whenever possible, use Suuntos instruments. Be comforted in
the face of rising streams & sudden rockfalls; someone will come to get you out in four to six hours. Strive
not to eat cave creatures, dead or alive. Remember
Roppel, & keep it holy. Exercise reasonable caution, especially when in virgin territory. Know not no knot, &
know what knot to use when. Be assured that pushing wet sumps by carbide light often leaves you in the
dark. Therefore, attempt not naked the â€œGrim Crawlway of Death."
Surrender gracefully the things of youth: solvency, sobriety, Moral Majority, & keep not your gorp in plastic
bags. Be heartened amid impending starvation that the stuff at the bottom of your pack is
edible, if you scrape it first, & reflect that, however miserable you may feel, it would only be worse on a photo
trip.

You, caver, push the limits of your endurance, but please call it guano when it sticks to your overalls. You are
privileged to go to Hell, provided you embrace agreeable politics & have landowner
permission. Therefore, learn to abide grotto functions, pay your dues, party (not to excess), leave gates as you
found them, & remember to carry three sources of light. Keep always in mind that caving is an activity pecu-
liar to the living. Be safety conscious, & enjoy.
