5 Teams went into Windy Mouth for
the WVACS Work Weekend. The hike, which
usually burns me out before we even reach
the cave, had been recently well maintained,
so getting to the cave was quite enjoyable. I
can't speak for the other teams, as I'm sure
they have their own stories to tell, but our
team included
Andrew Lycas
(sketcher), Megan Junod (lead tape/backsights), and
myself on frontsights. Our survey designation was
GD, for Gaping Dickhole or God Damn. The latter
was the phrase of choice on this trip, as we dealt
with almost getting lost on the way to our survey
(Goddammit, Lycas!), terrible volleyball kneepads,
god awful squeaking of the tape, and my forgetful-
ness in passing our one set of instruments to Megan
for backsights (Goddammit, Dianna!). At least all the
crawling back and forth kept me warm!
The overall survey was quite fun, really. It was
a good team, singing and joking and cursing like we
do. It was also a very flat survey; the majority of our
inclinometer readings were at dead 0, and after the
5th zero in a row, I exclaimed “fucking zero” and this
phrase was included in the survey notes and used
for the remainder of the trip. Towards the end of our
trip, we were crawling through ~2ft high passage
that was littered with formations, including antho-
dites (I think? I'm no geologist), and fluffs of gypsum
