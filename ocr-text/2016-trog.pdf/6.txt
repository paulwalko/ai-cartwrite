LETTER FROM THE EDITOR
Good Afternoon, VPI Cave Club,
Thank you to everyone who contributed to this Trog, whether it was writing an article, taking pictures
and letting me use them, instigating hijinks that served as fodder for great stories, or unwittingly
uttering something quotable.
I would like to say that you, as a group, have made my job as editor blissfully time-consuming.
Respectfully Submitted,
Amy Skowronski
