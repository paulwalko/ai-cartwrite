Rocks Left by the Living
By Kellen Levinson
The sport of caving has attracted curious adventure seekers for over a century. Caves not
only offer a thrill to the adrenaline junkies in the world, but also dazzle us with beautiful rock for-
mations, sediments, and a unique array of flora and fauna. However, caves have more to offer
than just their gypsum and salamanders. Caves are the home of many magnificent fossils, million
year old remnants of strange creatures found nowhere else on the planet. For the archaeolo-
gists among us, caves can give an exciting first-hand opportunity to discover new species and
specimens that surpass those found anywhere else on the surface. But what makes cave fossils
special? How do fossils forms in caves, and what fossils can you find in your area?
Fossils in caves tend to appear in two ways. The most common way is via sediment. When
an animal dies, its body becomes entrapped in silt or mud which then turns to sediment. In this
sediment, the bones, teeth, and even cartilage can be preserved into rock. When caves form, it's
not unusual to see massive splits in the earth where limestone layers have separated and be-
come exposed- potentially exposing any fossils within the sediment. Cave walls can be worn
away by water and time to expose fossils as well, and we occasionally find them underneath our
feet. Depending on where you are on the planet, the fossils contained in these sediments are
typically creatures that had once been in the ocean, and contain mollusks, arthropods, and even
fish. Fossils can also be preserved in caves when animals wander in or become trapped and die.
Insects and bacteria will eventually strip the flesh, but the bones remain undamaged and un-
moving. If the cave has conditions that favor preservation, these bones may fossilize with the
natural formations of the cave.
One example of limestone fossils can be found in our very own Tawney's Cave. There are
multiple areas in the cave where the wall and ceilings have been worn or split to reveal shells
that were once part of an ocean floor.

Several years ago, a cave found in the Dominican Republic gained worldwide notoriety
when it revealed some of the best preserved fossils of ancient crocodiles, monkeys, lemurs,
sloths, and bats. These animals had once lived in and around the cave, and the bodies of the de-
