Cave Rescue Report
THIS IS NOT A PRESS RELEASE AND THE INFORMATION WITHIN IS NOT FOR PUBLIC
DISTRIBUTION. PLEASE CONTACT A BCRG BOARD MEMBER FOR INFORMATION
THAT MAY BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC.
On the evening of Saturday March 12th at approximately 9 pm a small party of cavers from the Univer-
sity of Maryland Terrapin Trail Club entered Link's Cave. Sometime around 10 pm someoneâ€”let's
call him Henry-became stuck in a high lead in an area of the cave known as the canyon section. (See
attached map) After several attempts to free the caver by the caving party, the decision was made to
get help around 10:30 pm. Reaching the landowner's home, who is a caver himself, contact with
BCRG was made and a VPI caver on site, Alice Jaworski, entered the cave to assess the situation and
report back.
Zenah Orndorff received the call for BCRG at 11:33 and began to inquire on availability. Jon Lillesto-
len responded to the scene to make an assessment of the situation. Given the size, familiar nature of
the cave, and the late hour the hope was to resolve the incident with little fanfare.
First contact was made around 11:50 by Alice and Jon arrived shortly after, around midnight. It was
quickly determined that freeing the entrapped caver would require more than simple tools and tech-
niques. Calls were placed to BCRG members experienced with rock removal techniques and Mike
Ficco, Katarina Kosic, Eric Stanley and Steve LePera responded.
Mike and Katarina arrived around 1 am and with a large drill began the process of drilling 42 inch
holes and using hand tools to further fracture the rock. The caver was stuck in a keyhole type passage
with a knee and ankle tightly wedged. Eric and Steve arrived around 3 am with a second drill and ex-
tra batteries.
With dawn approaching an Echo Responder alert was placed. Gabe Lavine and Tom Lovejoy arrived
on the scene with Response 53 and the BCRG trailer with additional supplies from BVRS that in-
cluded air chisels and cribbing material. Fortunately, the caver was freed at approximately 4 am
without the need for the air chisel. After a brief rest period for food, water and rewarming the caver
was able to exit under his own power. All cavers and resources were out of the cave at 4:30.
Of note, the times around this event are complicated by the change with daylight savings time and
uncertainty among different parties as to which time their watch was set to.
