Friction is experienced as a force which resists motion. The factors which determine the amount
of resistance to motion, the magnitude of friction force, are twofold: a numerical representation of sur-
face roughness, and the force perpendicular to the plane of motion. To enumerate the details:
Frictional force F is proportional to normal force N; N being the force with which the
surfaces push against one another.
The friction coefficient u takes into account the roughness of both materials in contact
with one another, in this case, the roughness of the rope and rappelling device.
The frictional force can be found as follows:
F=un
Typical friction coefficient ranges for ropes of
various materials sliding on smooth steel surfaces
Friction coefficient - static
Rope material
Observe the table on the
right. Under identical loading,
the rope with a higher u value
will produce a larger friction
force. Note that the coefficient
is different for dry and wet
rope. This explains why it is
easier or more difficult to rappel
on different types of rope.

Unfortunately, I did not find relevant coefficients for rope caked in mud after being dragged through a
100 foot crawl, nor could I find any information on the friction coefficient of the steel cable permanent-
ly rigged at the platform.
In the case of the rappel devices commonly used by cavers, a rope under tension is passed over
