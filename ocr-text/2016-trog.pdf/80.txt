QUOTABLE QUOTES
Andrew Lycas: Take inspirational pictures of
people and put their shitty quotes under them.
JEchols: Well, I was dressed as a box of wine
and I was swinging around on the pole and the
box was pretty big and awkward and I ended
up slamming my arm into the wall. And now |
have this huge bruise.
Tommy Cleckner: I had zero
experience and zero guidance and
performed accordingly.
Wil Orndorff: Every time you change anything in
Microsoft Jerk-Office, it shits all over your
entire document.
