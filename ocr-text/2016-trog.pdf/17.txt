This year's Young Timers' Reunion was
held at the RASS field station. Folks
came from all over to go caving in some
of the Richmond area's
finest caves.
At least one of these caves was used #
as a saltpeter mine during the Civil
War, which means that 150 years
ago, it was-floor to
ceiling-filled with dirt.
