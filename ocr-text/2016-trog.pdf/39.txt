Dirt digger, beer chugger
I've been warned about you
Mud roller, naked stroller
What they've been saying must be true
[Bridge]
Rock hard caver
Drunk tree hugger
Careful where you runnin' to
[Chorus]
Now you're messin' with a
A Tooth in the mud!
(Now you're messin' with a tooth in the mud)
Now you're messin' with a
A Tooth in the mud!
(Now you're messin' with a tooth in the mud)
Talkin' bloody, broken muzzle
You ain't an emergency
Big laugher, born lover
You ain't too hurt to party
[Bridge]
Rock hard caver
Drunk tree hugger
Careful where you runnin' to
[Chorus]
Now you're messin' with a
A Tooth in the mud!
(Now you're messin' with a tooth in the mud)
Now you're messin' with a
A Tooth in the mud!
(Now you're messin' with a tooth in the mud)
[Pipes Solo]
[Chorus]
Now you're messin' with a
A Tooth in the mud!
(Now you're messin' with a tooth in the mud)
[Repeat]
