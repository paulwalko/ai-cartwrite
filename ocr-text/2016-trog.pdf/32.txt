tered the cave in teams, with goals of hauling new rope to the various pits and hauling out the rope
previously left in the cave. We again reached Knipling pit after a few hours of caving, having rigged
the two prior drops with new rope. Rigging Knipling Pit took enough time that I started shivering.
After my last encounter, this pit scares me.
When it's my turn to rappel, I cautiously get on the
rope with yet more cursing. I took my time rappelling,
probably making it down in record slowness.
Thoughts questioning why I'm once again in this cave
were ever present. Once I reached the bottom, relief
floods my mind, and I moved to the next drop.
The Weathermaker, a 170' drop, proved trou-
blesome to rig, as we did not have quite enough rope
left over of our portion. An hour of rigging and re-
rigging passed. I begin getting cold and pull out a my-
lar blanket and a candle. Warmth still proves elusive.
Finally, we proceeded down the drop. This drop runs
near a waterfall, and the bottom of the pit is fairly
cold. Tommy Cleckner and Chris returned from Meg-
adome farther into the cave and lent us a hand with
the re-rigging. Some of moved to a warmer area and
huddled together while we wait. At this point, I'd been
shivering at three separate instances and was ready
to leave the cave. Others were eager to leave as well, and once the Weathermaker is re-rigged for
the umpteenth time we headed up. We slogged up and out of the cave, and once again I was curs-
ing the cable ladder as I climbed it with too tired muscles and a heavy pack full of vertical gear. I
made it out, after 13 hours of cold and crawling.
Now, as this tale illustrates, fully knowing your gear is essential if you don't want to have terri-
fying, death-defying experiences. In this case, I gained that knowledge the hard way, but there are
easier ways to do so. Additionally, one shouldn't let
overconfidence at having done something successfully
a few times get in the way of caution and a healthy re-
spect for the hazards that exist. While I do and enjoy
trips that push me and humble me, I'm beyond the rook-
ie mistake of thinking I know and am ready for every-
thing.
