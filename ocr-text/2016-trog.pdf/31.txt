with Andrew Lycas, Tommy Cleckner, Dianna Orndorff, and Jeramie Clifford. We were determined
to see the rest of the cave, having put in so much work reopening its passages. Hauling our packs
with our vertical gear and rope, we proceeded inward and downward. We went down the ten foot
nuisance drop where the rope was still suitable for our use, and immediately after encountered the
30' to 40' nuisance drop with the rope that had been there for years still hanging over the edge. It
had so much calcite buildup that it made a very satisfying crunching sound when we bent sections of
it. Needless to say, we weren't using that rope. After we all made it down, we still had much crawling
and climbing to do until we reached our next drop. When we finally reached Knipling Pit, a 160' drop,
we were three or four hours into a cave trip which we had decided was a grand idea on a Tuesday
night. Andrew, Jeramie, and Dianna rappel the drop, and then it's my turn.
Thad rappelled pits of similar length before, and perhaps I was inexperienced enough to be
cocky. I ran the rope through the scarab, my rappel device, and started downward. The rope we had
brought in was stiff, and I had to feed my scarab. At some point, perhaps 30' down the drop, feeding
the rope and bouncing on my scarab, I took my left hand off the scarab, allowing the rope to come
off of the horn. I then have a three bar device and began falling with speed. At this point, I couldn't
put enough tension to brake with my right
hand, and I felt fear and panic rising. I be-
gan yelling, "Help!" with increasing urgen-
cy to my comrades above and below as I
searched for ways to slow my fall. I
wrapped my foot and leg around the rope
and finally managed to brake, about half-
way down Knipling Pit. Simultaneously,
Jeramie had been taking slack out of the
rope below to effectively belay.
At this point, I found that I couldn't
take the tension out of the rope to put it
back over the horn without resuming my
fall. A few minutes of conferring with
Tommy and he talks me through a
changeover onto my (borrowed) ascend-
ing gear. Once I'm secure on the ascend-
ing gear, I attempted to change back over
to the scarab but found that since the
gear is adjusted for someone much taller
than me I cannot switch back. And so, ||
proceeded back up the rope. It's slow go-
ing as the adrenaline had run its course
through my body and I was shaking in the
aftermath. I get to the top and off rope and let the realization that I had a non-zero probability of
death just a few moments before flow over me. We decided to call the trip and head out of the cave.
Once I'm ready to start moving again, Tommy and I began retracing our way back, with the rest to
follow once they've made it up Knipling Pit. We got lost a few times on our way out, adding to my
exhaustion, but we make it out, again cursing the cable ladder. It's 3am, I had a close encounter
with death, and I had to work the next morning.
Months later, I had the opportunity to return to the cave, and like an idiot I took it. I had months more
experience with vertical caving, and this time I was armed with the knowledge of what I had done to
precipitate my fall. And so I returned to Doe Mountain Cave with Tommy Cleckner, Chris Garguilo,
Jeramie Clifford, Eliot Eding, Andrew Lycas, Tommy Polson, and Kyle Mills. This time, we don't
even enter the cave before the trouble starts: On the trails to the cave, my car slides off the muddy
track and into a stump. After much effort, my car is freed using some webbing and pushing. We en-
