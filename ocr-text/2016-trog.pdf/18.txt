VAR
Spring VAR was held at Endless Caverns. VPI
had a good showing, what with the gargling of
Wild Turkey, dancing ecstatically, befriending
the band, wearing helmets into the commercial
cave, and general rambunctiousness.
Five minutes prior to its commencing, our club's
president was reminded that he had to put his pants
on all the way if he wanted to attend the formal
meeting of the Virginia Area Region.
