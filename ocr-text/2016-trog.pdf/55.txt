tom of an 80ft dome! We also left three leads
back there: 2 needed bolting or some other assist
and the other was a very low, crappy, muddy
crawl. This was a 11.5 hour trip, and we had
found an impressive dome and dubbed it
THUNDERDOME! To stay in line with the ini-
tial name of Thunder Hall.
Trip 2: The second trip took place on Saturday,
November 21st. There were two teams in the
cave: Team 1 (Joe Calderone, Andrew Lycas, and
Tommy Cleckner) continued the passage that we found when
we got lost in the cave last trip. They yielded around 400 of
surveyed passage which was not on the map! And I led
Team 2 (Tony Canike, Amy Hein, Hope Brooks, and Eric
Pelkey) back to Thunderdome to start the bolt climb! We
were able to work our way up the second lead that we found
via a short 15-bolt climb which eventually put us about 40ft
up in the
dome to a
traverse line.
While Eric
and Tony
were doing all of this bolting, Hope, Amy and myself took it
upon ourselves to survey the tiny mud passage near the bot-
tom of the dome. Man is it tight, and it goes, has animal foot-
prints and moves cold air, but will need more enlarging. This
trip was about 12.5 hours long and we still had a ways to go.
Trip 3: We
were going to get to the top of Thunderdome, damn-it! We re-
turned on a WVACS Project weekend on January 9th , 2016.
Tommy Cleckner, Andrew Lycas, and Amy Skwornoski re-
turned to their area they had been working in, while Dave
Socky, Hope Brooks, Tony Canike, Beth Mutchler, and I went
to Thunderdome, this time loaded down with a crap ton of
ropes, bolts, and hangers. The bolting team went ahead and
started a traverse that was discovered back in November, and
the survey team followed along behind them, surveying the
passage up to the traversable shelf. After a few hours of bolting,
Tony eventually got to a point on the 40 foot shelf that he could
set some bolts for a rig so that others could climb up. I went up the rope to look at the remaining obstacle and
Eric and I decided that I would let Tony and Eric continue the last 20 to 30 feet up a very sketch-tastic mud
slope. I was not too keen on learning how to bolt climb forty feet up on a two foot shelf that could hold barely
55
