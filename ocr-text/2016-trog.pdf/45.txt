method called SLAM, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, to image. As the internal laser
showered the walls with laser light, collecting distance information of each point, a 3D structure
would be recorded almost instantaneously not only of the surrounding rock, but would also rec-
ord the location in the surrounding cave of where the sensor was located. From the map that's
created as you walk the sensor along the cave you could produce 2D maps, 3D printed models,
discover how close to the surface potential dead runs lead, and have a better idea of how the
cave was formed. Though costs for these units have been prohibitively expensive recent break-
throughs in research have brought costs down tremendously, almost to a hobbyist level.
The Future
Cave surveying will certainly be a useful tool in the near future although, like the telephone re-
placed the carrier pigeon, 3D mapping may replace cave surveying. Higher accuracy, faster
mapping times, and increased data collection are all reasons to adopt this new technique. Dirt
and water can be challenging with precision electronics and may be a reason to continue teach-
ing the older techniques. Water, being highly reflective, can mess up distance measurements
leading to incorrect maps. Dirt can fall onto the lens and prevent any data from being taken.
Time spent underground holding tape measures and sketching unique features would be lost,
dropping your notebook in slime-y mud would be a thing of the past. Old timers could emerge
from their caves and yell about how new technologies can lead to youngsters never learning
the traditional techniques that everyone has grown up on. Techniques that instilled a true love
for nature and internal calling to live underground.
Lost Skills
Any new skill can lead to forgetting older ones, and the old timers may have a point. With the
carbide lamp test being pushed away due to the availability and affordability of LED headlamps,
maybe soon even our cell phones will be able to map the cave for us. A form of technology that
we've rapidly adopted since its invention. We'll be flooded with methods to map the world be-
low us, what happens when we forget why bringing a pencil and paper underground was im-
portant? How do we continue to adopt newer and more accurate methods of mapping without
losing the valuable lessons, skills,
and experiences that are gained
through the older ones? Is more
gained by spending more time
surveying the cave than just walk-
ing through it with one of these
fancy new sensors? There are mil-
lions of questions during any
change that you can ask and a lot
than can be lost. The big ques-
tion, I think, that we should be
asking is how we move forward
while continuing to carry along the
important lessons and experiences
gained through using older tech-
niques.
