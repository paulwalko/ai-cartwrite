(Footnote: in corresponding with Chris Howe of Wild Things Publishing (Descent Maga-
zine) – I received this bit of information which seems somehow relevant: “British slang
for toilet is ‘bog'. That means something else in the NSS: Board of Governors. The num-
ber of times I've been told by someone, proudly, that they have been elected to sit on the
bog for the coming year. ”)
