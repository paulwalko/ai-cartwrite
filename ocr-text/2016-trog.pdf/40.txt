PSA: The Dangers of Frostbite to Cavers!
By Jason Delafield
Frost nip occurs when skin freezes. If the underlying tissue freezes as well, you have frostbite. Small
exposed body parts like fingers, toes, and ears are the most at risk. With frostbite, the skin gets very
cold, then numb, hard, and pale. Your intracellular fluid includes salts and when the fluid inside the
cell freezes, the delicate balance of salinity changes and fluid is drawn into the cell. This eventually
causes the cell to burst causing both tissue damage and blisters to form . Mild cases can be treated
with gradual warming--warming them too quickly can cause nerve damage. Severe cases require
medical care to prevent complications
The most common cause of frostbite is exposure to cold-weather conditions. However, it can also be
caused by direct contact with ice, freezing metals, or very cold liquids. Specific conditions that lead
to frostbite include: (1) wearing unsuitable clothing, (2) wind, and (3) prolonged exposure to cold.
You should avoid wearing clothing that isn't suitable for protection against cold, windy, or wet
weather; and avoid clothing that is too tight. You should avoid prolonged exposure to cold and wind.
Basically the same things that cause hypothermia increase your risk of frostbite. Your risk increases
when the air temperature falls below 5 F (-15 C), even with low wind speeds. Frostbite can occur on
exposed skin in less than 30 minutes if the wind chill is at or below minus 16.6 F (-27 C),
Any adequate caver knows the dangers of hypothermia. Hypothermia can occur at any temperature.
Frostbite, however, will not occur if the temperature is above 28 degrees Fahrenheit. Now caves am-
bient temperature is around 52 F. Why should cavers worry about frostbite then? Cavers should con-
sider what the weather will be when they exit the cave. The Important part, if you exit a cave cold,
wet, hungry, tired, and/ or improperly clothed you greatly increase your risk of frostbite. I had to
learn this the hard way.
It was Saturday 02/13/2016. My first time at WVACS. Everything was blanketed in snow outside. I
was headed to Culverson Creek, to the Wild Cat entrance. The week before at banquet I saw Bill Bal-
four talk on the cave, so I was excited to actually visit it. The trip's plan was to check out an old rope
ladder and replace it if necessary. On our way there we took a quick detour to see the log jam. What
a sight; pictures don't do
it justice. We made it to
the ladder, and replaced
the safety rope. The Lad-
der lead to the echo
tubes. We made echoes
in the echo tubes then
turned around and head-
ed out of the cave. Cul-
verson Creek, as you
might expect, has a creek
running through it. On
this trip we had to do a
lot of wading through the
