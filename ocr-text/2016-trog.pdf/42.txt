The Romantic Lives of Cave Salamanders
By Skylar Hopkins
On 6 March 2016, eight VPI cavers took a trip to Smokehole cave, in Giles County. This
trip was particularly special for the author of this article, because she saw cave sal-
amanders (Eurycea lucifuga) for the first time. Being a good biology graduate student,
the author went home and immediately looked up all of the published papers regarding
cave salamander biology. The search unearthed a gem that had to be shared: a detailed
description of the process by which cave salamanders get down and dirty.
In 1966, a Dr. James Organ collected 24 cave salamanders from Links Cave and brought
them to the Mountain Lake Biological station, where he proceeded to watch them get
busy. Unfortunately for Dr. Organ, cave salamanders are not exhibitionists. As Dr. Or-
gan explained, “Apparently the movement of my pencil, while sketching, had been de-
tected by them.A slight movement would interrupt courtship behavior and the pair would
move to the front of the container and stare [at Dr. Organ].”
But in his stealthiest moments of voyeurism, Dr. Organ gleaned quite a lot about cave
salamander courtship. For instance, the default position for cave salamanders involves
the female straddling the male's tail from behind while the male does something magi-
cal: twerking. With his head close to the ground and his hind end raised, the male gy-
rates the fat end of his tail while doing pushups with his back legs, so that his
badonkadonk repeatedly rubs against the female's face. If that's not romantic, I
don't know what is.
So, male salamanders have moves, but do they ever go spelunking? Alas, no. Instead, the
male eventually makes a very special
deposit for the female: a packet of
sperm called a spermatophore that is
suspended above the ground by a small
stalk. The female, sufficiently im-
pressed, plucks the spermatophore from
the stalk with her cloaca, and insemi-
nation is complete. I'm proud to say
the first and perhaps only documented
occurrence of this process occurred in
the VPI Cave Club's stomping grounds.
