two people. So I returned to the bottom and let Tony climb on
up. Meanwhile, the survey crew had wrapped up with a nice
survey of around 100 feet of passage! For the next several
hours, Hope, Beth, my Dad and I decided to entertain our-
selves by playing with the 31b sledge in the mud, and attempt-
ing to build a mud damn to block up the lower waterfalls. We
also enjoyed the occasional “ROCK!” and watching break-
down ranging from the size of a baseball to a microwave pelt
down a 40ft dome. Hope also brought her small speakers and
mp3 player so we jammed out to a wide variety of music from
the 80's to Top 40 hits. And yes, Africa was played many a
time. Eventually, Eric got to the top and rigged twenty more
feet of rope to get to the steep mud slope. We ran out of time to
continue our survey but from Eric's description it potentially
went! From where the waterfall is coming from, there was a
narrow canyon that cut back across from where the lower pas-
sage entered the dome. This would require a few bolts to set a
traverse line to get into. The other potential passage was a
large break trunk that hopefully would go more than 50 feet! It
certainly has the potential to turn and end immediately. Tony and Eric descended the ropes, we packed up, and
commenced our 4 hour trek out of the cave. It was a 15.5 hour trip.
And finally, Trip 4: Our return to Thunderdome in (Mad) Maxwelton Cave, WV finally occurred on Saturday,
April 2, 2016. Our team of five (David Socky, Tony Canike, Nick Socky, Eric Pelkey, and Hope Brooks)
climbed down the entrance culvert at about 10:45am, loaded down with large, heavy expedition packs. We
were weighted down because we had individual vertical gear, 200 feet of rope, a hammer drill, 8-inch nails, a
hammer, bolts, hangers, links, and lead climbing kit, along with all our normal caving gear, warm clothes,
food, and water. At the entrance to Thunder Hall, an area we now call “The Lunch Room”, we had lunch be-
fore starting to work on fixing up the waterfall climb. We had decided that it would be best to put bolts and a
rope at the top of the second waterfall so that we could have a safety while free climbing the two waterfalls.
The climbs were not particularly difficult, but if a slip occurred and/or a hand or foothold failed, a fall would
have resulted in a long, difficult, and protracted rescue. Not a good thing to happen that far back in the cave. I
put a couple of nails in at the base of the first waterfall,
letting us get up the climb without getting soaked.
Hopefully we would no longer need to bring a rain jack-
et in for the climb! Once at Thunderdome, Tony and
Eric climbed up first to see if we really had anything to
survey. As Hope climbed up to set the first station, we
heard Tony and Eric yelling and screaming - “OMG!
Wow! Borehole! Lots of borehole! How much survey
paper did you bring? At first, I thought maybe that they
were joking around, especially since yesterday was
April 1, but we kept hearing their exclamations of sur-
prise and excitement.
