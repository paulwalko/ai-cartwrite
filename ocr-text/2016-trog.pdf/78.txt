THE GROTTO GRAPEVINE
In January 2015, Dan and Ellen Crowder moved to Australia.
They had a fair number of run-ins with local wildlife, chased a
storm in their ute, and took the time to visit Cheese World
(open seven days a week!) and Crocodile Dundee's Walka-
bout Creek Hotel. It is expected that upon their arrival back to
Blacksburg, we will discover that they no longer understood
Fahrenheit, nor how to measure things in feet and miles, rely-
ing instead on metres and kilometres. This will make cave sur-
veying with either Crowder extraordinarily challenging.
John Echols and Sam Huff moved to Florida and promptly
joined up with the University of Florida's outdoor club.
They've even brought some Floridians back to Blacksburg so
we could ogle them and their weird coconuts. Almost imme-
diately, we put rum in the coconuts, shook 'em all up, and
proceeded to get drunk with the Floridians.
In October 2015, there was a cave rescue in Scott Hollow Cave in
Monroe County, WV when an individual broke his leg. Those of VPL
decided this was a far more worthy rescue than the 46 cavers who
got stuck in some cave somewhere when the batteries of the port-
able projector died while they were watching footage of Big Foot
and the Loch Ness Monster getting it on. Said cavers were rescued
later without injury or mishap, and rescuers were very impressed
with the stadium seating they had arranged for their underground
video viewing. The 46 cavers were trapped
for twenty eight hours with nothing but
"You know what they say about big feet..."
innuendos to keep them company.
At TAG, a beer fairy was born, quickly ad-
vanced through the ranks to general, and
successfully led its troops against the forc-
es of sobriety. The beer fairy was spotted
on numerous occasions across the TAG Fall
Cave-In property and late one evening was found shaking Jeramie Clifford's
tent with some of its soldiers.
John and Katrina George were married in May 2015 and in September of the
same year, they and Baby Juniper moved to North Dakota. They now measure
how cold it is by how long one can stay outside before their eyeballs freeze to
their eyelids. Juniper is pictured to the right.
