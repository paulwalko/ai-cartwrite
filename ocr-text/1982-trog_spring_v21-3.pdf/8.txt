97.
Alabama Bound
:
On Friday, March 19, a mangy , hardcore group from
VPI Grotto left Blacksburg for Alabama to bounce the BIG
pits. This group consisted of Daddy Don Anderson, Jim
Washington, Maureen Handler, Steve Lancaster, Walt Pirie,
Garrie Rouse, Richard 'Mother! Cobb, Lee 'Air Rappel! Little,
Steve 'Stymie! Conner, Hillary Minich, Commander-in-Chief
Jerry Redder, Janet Queisser, AÃ¯ch Neiser, Binny Ballou,
Chuck and Pat Shorten, Doug Perkins, Fran Wisthoff, Keith
'Animule' Smith, Big John Lohner, Pa-a-am Neiser, and Knox
Worde. We were allowed to stay on the grounds of Russell
Cave National Monument due to the incredible hospitality of
the Monument manager, John Mapel. Now this area of Alabama
is a dry county, but this has never stopped VPI cavers from
having a good time. The first group of Don, Jim, Maureen,
Steve Li, and Walt rolled into Russell Cave at about 10:00pm
and were well on their way to becoming incoherent when the
rest finally showed up at 12:30 am. After a wonderful night is
sleep, we were all rared up to go bouncing (as soon as
Garrie finished sewing his seat.) Lee was also found on the
ground under his hammock in the morning, further adding to
the legend of Air Rappel.
.. We split up into two groups for the day for ease
and speed. One group went to Caigle's Chasm, which is a
..beautiful, 186' shaft in the side of a mountain, just north
of the Alabama border. Richard was the first one down on
Janet's virgin PMI (it will never be the same). Fran had
a wonderful time on her new climbing rig. All in all, it ::
was an awesome first pit for all of us 'new' people. The
other group, led by our fearless Jerry Redder, went to the
Sinkhole. A 160' drop, right beside a roaring waterfall.
Besides getting soaking wet it was a great pit. Then the
