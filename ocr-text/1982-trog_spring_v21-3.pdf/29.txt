At this point, rigging was going on in two other places
in the cave. The first was at a small climb that needed to be
negotiated, the second was a chasm near the entrance. If the
reader has ever been to Buddy Penley's cave, it is likely that he
did not travel the routes used to remove the patients. The stokes
litters were lowered at 2:18 am. The rigging at the main pit was
complicated. At one point, the crew had to change some of the
points to gain a better advantage when bringing the patient up.
smoothly, away from the wall.. The hauling line was the simplest
possible. 10 cavers with Gibbs ascenders and a stop Gibb rigged
into the rope near the lip. . While the rigging at the drop was
going on, Bob's condition took a slight turn downward. First he
had to vomit, not an easy task when wrapped in a sleeping bag,
garbage bag, KED and a stokes litter!! His IV which was warming
him up, started to have problems and he got sick to his stomach.
The medical teams handled all of this without any great effort,
but it did take time. Also we wanted to bring Jackie, Bob's
primary medic, up the drop. At 3:49 am the riggers explained to
the people on the bottom, which ropes were for which purpose.
Bob Ulfers started up the drop, with Jim Jones along
side, at 4:20am, 11 hours after the rock had fallen. At the top
of the drop, 15-20 cavers from several different grottos, were
waiting to continue Bob out of the cave. Before Bob could be
moved, the medical team checked out his condition. This created
a small log jam of people, since the best place to check Bob was
not wide and offered only a high climb directly over him. After
this, the medical team said he could be transported. Bob did not
stop moving until he got to the 12' drop. This drop was rigged
with a high line, but the litter slings were too long for the
gentle touchdown. The passage was manned with an assortment of
cavers and rescue squad personnel. Many of the Rescue Squad
people had been attending a Cave Rescue Orientation Course in
Blacksburg... All of these people, including the cavers from Blue
Ridge who did some excellent rigging, must have moved very quickly,
because Bob was out of the cave at 6:35am. When notified of this,
the people who had just finished hauling Pete up, gave a big
cheer. Everytbody, having had practice with Bob, were able to move
Pete out very quickly. The only thing left to do was collect gear
and clean up the cave. This is an important aspect of a cave
rescue.
At 9:00am, Bob Ulfers, who had been flown to Roanoke, was
in serious condition with a depressed skull fracture, 2. hairline
fractures of the cervical spine, and a broken foot. Pete was at
Montgomery County Hospital with an open fracture of the left fore-
arm and a compound fracture of the right forearm. All in all it
was a well run and efficient rescue.
PRIMARY LESSONS LEARNED (or reinforced)
1. Don't stand in a rock fall zone.
2. Don't rig into a rope until the rope is clear.
3. In a rescue, keep the equipment moving to the destination.
4. Bring the telephones in as soon as possible.
5. Try to keep everyone aware of the condition of the victims and
the rescue. It is great for caver moral..
I would like to thank the cavers from Blue Ridge Grotto, Greenbriar
Grotto, Holston Valley Grotto, Mt. Empire Grotto, the Giles County
Rescue Squad, the VA Tech Ham Radio Operators and the students
from the Rescue Class for assisting us in the rescue.
