The technique is rather simple; you just turn off your lamp when
you're around a carbide caver and (hopefully) see by her or his
lamplight. Now this has offended many people and they've tried,
unsuccessfully, to lay guilt trips on me. However, the club's
discriminating practice of providing carbide and not D-cells
to its members makes me feel justified; I've paid my carbide
dues. I'd be glad to stop mooching if the club would change
its ways and stock D-cells.
Maintenance is one of the electric Jus trites strongest
points. I've lost track of the number of times I've heard
carbide cavers bitching at their lamps. I don't know about
you, but I'd rather cave than bitch. I must admit that I've
had my times of sudden, mysterios darkness, but usually a few
that doesn't work, a bulb from my spare parts kit will. As a
matter of fact, bulbs are all that's in my spare parts kit.
I admit that I might not take 1st in the cave pack competition
at OTR, but I have room for other goodies instead, like Moth
Balls, but that is another story.
Well, since I'm sure that you are all thoroughly
convinced of the practicability...of electric Justrites, there
is no need for me to continue.

Authors note:
I wrote the above piece of creative writing for strictly
humorous purposes (as a joke); don't take it too seriously.
Due to the tight and sleazy nature of many of the caves in
this (S.W.Va.) area, I don't really recommend the otherwise
OK electric Justrite over anything except maybe a cigarette
lighter, matches, or the plastic Jus trite, as a primary light
source. Â· It's your choice.
