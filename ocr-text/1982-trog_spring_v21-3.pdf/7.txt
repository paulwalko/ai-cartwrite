The Easter Beer Hunt was held at Jozo and Carolzo's this
year, on Glen Davis' birthday. About 24 baskets of Miller bunnies
were easy to find until 3 inches of snow fell on the ground. The
Easter Beer Tree was attacked first, but the battle had to be
fought the rest of the way with Wheat Lamps on hands and knees.
The entire bunny hutch was wiped out except for 6 missing in action.
Picnic weekend started on Friday night with Joe and Carol
Zokaites' wedding. The candle lit wedding ceremony, held in the
nature preserve in Ellett Valley near the entrance to a small cave,
featured singing by Hugh Beard. Also in attendance were dozens
of Zo clones. We're still not sure if Carol left with the correct
Zokaites brother. At picnic the next day, an organized frontal
attack was staged on 6 kegs hiding beneath the evil drinking lantern.
Guerilla attacks caused many casualties at the Willy's Bar and Grill;
bitter skirmishes continues well into the night. Some of the more
severely wounded, contented themselves with drinking Tequila and
howling at the moon. Clean-up operations Sunday morning were a.
grisly affair with dead bodies and dead kegs strewn about the battle-
field. Dead kegs soon became weapons as Redder's van was victim
of keg-rolling. That afternoon, the women were let loose on Randy
Woods for the annýal rape and rip-off. Needless to say, the women
succeeded. With all the kegs wiped out, the troops took their
vehicles hill climbing, Teddy Roosevelt style; Lawrences jeep,
Dave Cinsavich's Jeep Amundson's Scout, Sharon's Toyota, Deck's
truck, even Hugh's Valium made it up the hill. Lawrence took his
Jeep up another hill cimb and it blew up, his fan spinning right
through the radiator. Lawrence's Jeep and Maureen's motorcycle were
the only vehicle casualties at the event.
Elsewhere during picnic, there was a clean-up trip to
Buddy Penley's, a. 3 hour Harmon's to Paul's connection trip, and
the annual women's trip to Coon Cave. Ed Devine took a diddley pole
trip into Paul's only to watch John Deck free climb the lead. The
bicycler's were at it again, pedalling to picnic with only one
casualty. Richard Cobb took off with his hang glider from Big
Walker Mountain; spent most of the afternoon in the air, and almost
spent spent the night in the top of a tree 10 miles away. Buddy
Penley was given a Model A belt buckle as a gift from the club.
Alan Armstrong was seen kissing something other than a sheep,
probably at the group massage around the campfire.
Stringfellow is planning a July 4th shoot-out, the
Sauvigne's are planning a vacation out West in their Urban Assault
