Without ever going up another inch, I thought of the "chest compressor,"
I also remembered not to panic, although I'm sure my heartbeat went into high
gear, I went up on the rope and started to de-rig. That took approximately
ten minutes, because I had tension on the rope with one cam which made it hard
to pull the pin out, I could hear Pete moaning below. Then came the chest
Compressor. I spent five minutes gust: relaxing; : taking a sip of water. That
was very hard to do as I wanted to hurry and get help, but I knew I wasn't
going to get through that tight spot if I hurried. I left the cam rig and my
rack behind and took off my coveralls, violently I might add.. A few cycles of
breathing out and squirming and I was. through.
Over a familiar pit I came to a junction. I ripped off a piece of my
coveralls, which I had carried over my shoulder, and left it there in case I
came that way again. I went straight about 25 feet where it dead-ended. I
went back to the junction and took another route. "Ah, familiar cave. Oh,
there's that little hole we came through. Nope, try a little further down. :
Yes." By now my coveralls were soaked with water and mud and weighed 50 .
pounds. There they stayed. Damn, my lamp went out. Be calm, I said to myself
again and again and I took another sip of water..
I got my lamp lit and off I went. Each time I came to a junction I
memorized my choice. Soon I had a sequence like LLR or LLS, where L = left,
R = right and S = straight. The sequence changed often as I ran into dead-ends
and had to retrace my steps to make another choice. By and by I recognized a .
rock or a passage. When I came to the 12 foot climb I knew I would find my
way out. It was some consolation to know that if I didn't, thÃ« sign-out system
would have gotten help eventually. Next thing I saw daylight, and I must havea
looked pitifull crawling up the entrance hill. It had taken approximately an
hour and a half from the time of the accident.
Boy was I glad Pete had told me where his keys were. I got them, got into
the Scout, grabbed a beer and flew down the mountain. I almost broke down
Buddy's door, Buddy went looking for his rescue. card, but I remembered
Lawrence Britt's phone number and called him for the rescue.
The rest of the night I smoked cigarettes (the regular kind for a change),
drank coffee and sat with the surface phone, I observed and listened to the
finest rescue operation one could imagine. As Pete said later, if one had to
get hurt, this was probably the best place for it. (Typist's note: Next time
Pete, get clobbered ABOVE ground!) Not to take away from the help from the
other grottos though, because they were superb. Approximately 12 hours after
I called Lawrence, both Pete and Bob were en-route to the hospital.
Always send a skinny person up the rope first..
P.S. I drove Pete's Scout home for him (while quaffing a few) and I got
stopped for a license check. Of course, it was nowhere to be found.
