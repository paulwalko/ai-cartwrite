force behind the mining effort -- Earl Dorr's name lies written in
carbide at the entrance to some crawlways. As we started crawling,
I wondered why a ventilation pump had been installed at the
entrance; the air in the tight spots was between 65 and 70 degrees!
I could now see why my guide had to wait 2 to 3 days after blasting
in here for the air to become breathable again. The density of
popcorn rock, as well as other speleothems, was amazing. The
walls of every passage were festooned with crystal white popcorn
rock, which delighted the eyes but made crawling a painfuli
experience.
The 'prospector I was with explained that the company's
policy was to allow anyone with a genuine interest in the cave
to work on the search. As compensation, a person receives added
shares of company stock correlating to the amount of time spent
in the cave. Unfortunately, this has resulted in many weekend
prospectors digging and blasting in directions which obviously do
"not go." This coupled with no accurate survey of what has been
done in the cave, has resulted in a rather haphazard operation.
But, the people who work regularly on the cave, do not seem to
mind, since they enjoy working in a beautifully desolate area of
the desert in search of a classic western legend. In addition,
there are several other cave entrances on the same mountain
which are being explored as well, for a possible route to the
river.
