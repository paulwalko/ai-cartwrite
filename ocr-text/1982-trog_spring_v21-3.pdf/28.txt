The Rescue
Buddy Penley's cave is approximately 50 miles from
Blacksburg. The average driving time to the cave is 17 hours. i.
At 9.15 pm the first vehicles were arriving in the field to start
the rescue. Of the first people to arrive, it was decided that
Bob Barlow would handle the above ground communications and Jerry
Redder would coordinate underground. Buddy Penley's cave is not
that well known and Jerry was the only person at the scene, who
knew how to reach the drop quickly. At this point the victims
had been in the cave for 11 hours and hurt for 4 hours. Jerry
took Gene Harrison, Cardiac EMT; Bob Elron; Harold Chrimes, Shock
Trauma. EMT, Jim Jones and Steve Lancaster into the cave at 9:30.
The initial team carried emergency medical supplies, vertical
gear, and a sleeping bag. This group was to travel light and
bring work out as soon as possible. Upon arriving at the top of
the pit, Jerry attempted to communicate with Pete on the bottom.
The only work understood was COLD! Jim Jones, with the sleeping
bag went, down first as he was the first ready. Gene Harrison
immediately followed. While the initial team was going down,
Lawrence Britt, Lee Little, and Hugh Beard were bringing a phone
line in. When the line reached the top of the drop, Steve and
Jerry sent the line down a separate' hole in the floor. By 10:40pm
the communications were set up from the bottom of the pit to the
surface. On the surface, "Ham" radio operators had us in direct
contact with our phone link, operated by Pat Shorten, in Blacksburg.
The condition of the two patients, as it appeared ini-
tially, was that Bob had a laceration on the top of his scalp but;
that his skull appeared okay. From the pain in his shoulder, he
was thought to have a broken clavical and he was complaining
about pain on his left side and shoulder. His pupils were equal
and reactive (this was a good sign). Pete was cold and it appeared
that both of his forearms were broken. As the initial medical
team was accessing the victims, the cavers at the main drop began
searching for suitable rig points to bring them up the drop. The
normal rig point to explore the lower portion of the cave has a ;
very narrow crawlway just beyond the drop on the way out. The
initial riggers were Chuck Shorten, John Lohner, Rich Neiser, and
Joe Zokaites. Rig points were found that would enable the patients
to bypass the tight spots and also greatly expediate the e.y.acuation.
The riggers soon became aware that the top of the pit that the
patients were to come up, was very unstable. The medical team
advised us that Bob could not be moved until a special, flexible.
back board, known as a KED, was put on him. Bob was still very..
vulnerable to the falling rocks.
Fortunately, the Giles County Rescue Squad had recently
purchased several of these items. Jackie Redder, Carol zokaites,
Kenny Bonenburger, and Ben Keller were coming in as a back-up
medical team for the second patient, Pete. They were also
bringing the KED. The second medical team and the KED started
down the drop at 11:58pm. The riggers had figured out how they
wanted to rig the drop and started preliminary work waiting for
Bob to be moved. As soon as the second medical team was on the
bottom, they rigged the non injured victim Bill Kelly into a set
of Gibbs ascenders. Bill was at the top of the drop at 12:43am.
