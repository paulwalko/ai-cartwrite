the walls, ceiling, ground, just everywhere! Walking through the
Junction and having the crystals playing "acid" with our eyes was
a trip.
After taking a few pictures we cruised to the "Snowfall
Room", which has piles of moonmilk powder. We had never seen any
thing like it before. From here, the moonmilk is seen in many
sections of the cave, giving it an more pleasant appearance, .
instead of the usual brown walls. Up ahead, I heard John yelling
that he had found "Jon's Passage." It is a winding passage lined
with glistening crystals. Once out of the passage, we climbed
through the "Slickenside" into the "Fault Room." It would have
been a boring room, but Paul, being a geology graduate from VA
TECH, explained the distinctive features of the room and the
slickenside. Throughout the trip, Paul pointed out the subtle
geological features of Ellison's,
We knew that we were getting closer to "Angel's Paradise"
because we kept seeing patches of angel's hair along the way. : A
unusual crawl before the paradise is over "The Ledge," a 15" long
rock slab over a 10' pit. Once past the ledge, we spent an hour
looking for the "North Pole," and to mu camera's disappointment,
we could not find the crystal-clear icicles.
Entering the "Angel's Paradise" is like walking into
another world. Being extremely careful of where we stepped, we
gazed with awe at the shear beauty of the room saturated with
gypsim hair. Once out of the Paradise, we came upon "The Cottage
Chese," a remarkable "White plaster sculpture" of sea coral.
Then came "The Carbide Dumps"; more of this "white Plaster" stuff
but scattered in piles on on the ground like spent carbide.
We had lunch at the "W76 Junction," a large hall full
of moonmilk. From there we decided to head out of the cave. We
had John and Paul lead us back, and they knew the way as if they
had been in Ellison's a hundred times. John especially has a keen
memory of difficult cave passages. Time flies and soon enough we
were at the bottom of the big pit. The past 12 hours of caving
was so magnificient that the thought of ascending nearly 600'
never crossed our minds. To save time, we ascended Fantastic Pit
in tandem with each pair taking about 35 minutes. When it comes
to vertical caving, ascending has always been the favorite of mine,
that is, the work out that I get and enjoying the heights,
