STYMIE SPEAKS
I'm beginning my term as President with a
great deal of optimism about the club. I have a
good group of dedicated and competent officers to
work with, as well as many members willing to devote ..
time and energy to the club. Fine leadership in
recent years has built a group of stout cavers,
well worthy of wearing the VPI Grotto patch.
Getting to the underground scene, several
surveying projects are still underway. Joe and
Carol Zokaites are plugging away at mapping
Newberry-Banes, while Lawrence Britt continues to
score virgin passage in Starnes. Ed Devine was .
still mopping up leads in Paul Penley's over picnic
and Banes Spring has a few miserable leads yet to
go. Roppel Cave, Kentucky, continues to attract a
few sadistic VP1 cave surveyers from time to time.
Spring break found twenty or more of us practicing
SRT in Tennessee and Alabama. There was also a trip to Ellison's
by Frank Gibson, Eric Anderson and others.
As always, summer will be short and fall quarter will be
here before we know it. Keith Smith and I will be ready for it
with plans for ridge walks, vertical sessions, a practice rescue
and an all out effort to boost new membership. Remember, the
future of a student grotto, like VPI, depends upon its training
program. It is important that the club members take an active
interest in meeting and training prospective members. Lead a
prospective member tripll Help with vertical sessions! Teach
someone to read brunton! Pass on technical know-how and advice
to the new blood.
Also remember that in the Fall, new people come to cave
club meetings looking for a competent person to take them caving.
Someone they can trust with their lives to lead them through a.
cave. Outrageously obnoxious behavior during club meetings,
hardly projects a competent image and is counter-productive to
the training program.
In closing, I want to wish everyone a good summer. Cave
hard, party hard, and save your aluminum (the club needs the
bucks!T). See you at Old Timers!
