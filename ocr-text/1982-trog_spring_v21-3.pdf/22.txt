Everything You Always Wanted To Know
About Electric Justrites *
In direct contradiction to popular opinion, us electric
cavers do have reasons (besides general ignorance and stupid.
ity) for using electric Justrites. Some of them are really
Â· quite good....
... "To begin with, these lamps are really easy to use. It
takes most people a whole hand to light their carbide lamps;
an electric Justrite can be lit with a mere finger. You
flexible types could even use a boot if you so desired. Once
lit, its piercing beam comes in handy both for seeing into far
away holes and blinding smartasses who call you a "damned
electric caver.".
The fact that an electric Justrite has no flame can be
really helpful at times. I can honestly say, without fear of
false advertising accusations, that I've never heard of a
case of one crapping out in a water fall, or blowing out in a
windy passage or when pushing your way through a field of COW
pies on a windy night. Climbing a rope is yet another in-
stance where an electric lamp is nice; no mater how hard you
try, you just can't burn the rope. I think any self-respecting
caver knows that it is not healthy to burn the rope you're :
hanging on; the ensuing fall is usually no problem, but the
landing at the end is real hard to deal with.
Those of you who are into inverted rope techniques,
(rappelling and climbing upside down) whether by choice or
not, will be interested in this next point. An electric
Justrite works just as well upside down as right side up.
There is no water to run out of it and it won't fall off your
me. to. the subject of mounting techniques of which there are
many. I prefer the through-the-helmet mount. This is where
you drill a hole in the front and back of your helmet and just
thread the wire right on through. This gets the wire out of
the way. so it won't get snapped off on some rock. Also, there
is no way the thing's going to fall off your helmet when it is
attached this way. Now I know there are a few skeptics out
there who may say that holes weaken your helmet. Well I've
got a fiber-board helmet and my answer to them is, to quote.
a profound individual, "when you ain't got nothin', you ain't
got nothin' to lose." Oh, by the way, if you use this method,
don't forget to screw the lamp itself into the front of your
helmet after you run the wire through, as you will have .
serious difficulties if you do not.
Energy sources are another sensitive area of lamp
carbide; I won't argue with that, but I have been known to
squeeze as many as 20 hours out of 4 D-cells.. "How do you
do it?" you ask. Its called taking advantage of a good
situation, otherwise known as mooching off of carbide cavers. .
But Didn't Care To Ask !!
