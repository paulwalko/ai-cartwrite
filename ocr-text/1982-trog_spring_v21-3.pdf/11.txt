ĐTC Report:
Drinking Off The Shelf
You're at a party and the liquor runs out. It's too
late to buy more. What can you do? Perhaps you know where the
local "nip joint" is or know a friend who "always has some", but
the solution to your problem may be as close as the nearest 24
hour supermarket. All you need is the mental attitude of a deter-
mined wino and a stainless steel stomach. Recently, I went down
to the local Kroger store and checked out the facts on alcohol
that's not covered by the regulations governing beverages.
: What we're talking about consists mostly of flavorings,
extracts, and non-prescription drugs. The prices run from amaz.
ingly cheap to outrageously high, so you have to balance your.
desire to drink with your wallet and your digestive tract's ability
to withstand abuse. Since you should have a pretty good idea of
what you can stand to drink, I will emphasize price. Price essen-
tially means what you are paying to get a given amount of alcohol.
As proofs, packaging, and prices vary, I have tried to give you
an easy basis for comparison of the items I surveyed. To do this,
I have included in the following table a price, called the 750 ml
price, which represents what you would have to pay in order to get
enough of the article in question to equal the amount of alcohol
in an 80 proob, 750 ml bottle of rum.

.. . So, there you have it, or at least part of it. There's a lot
more on the shelves than I have covered here, but I hope you now have
a feel for what can be done if one is desperate enough. Don't be afraid
to experiment, but DO read any instructions that may come with what
you buy. Happy Partying!
оооооооооооо.
