The Wait
As most people reading this know, on April 17, about
5:15pm while Bob Ulfers, Pete Sauvigne, Mike Moore and I were going
up the 1201 drop in Buddy Penley's cave, a large rock fell about
90' and hit Bob on the head and Pete in the arms. Five hours later,
Jim Jones rappelled down to where we were waiting and seemed to be
the most beautiful sight we had ever seen (which proves that we
were all hypothermic).
Bob was unconscious for the first five minutes of this
five hour wait, but after that was conscious and for the most part,
aware of what was going on. Pete told me that I needed to keep
Bob talking and I asked him what he wanted to talk about. He said
that he wanted to talk about Jesus, and for the most part of the
next five hours, we talked about our Lord Jesus Christ. Obviously,
when someone is lying on a cave floor bleeding and getting very
hypothermic, he is not going to feel like having a deep theological
discussion of some minute detail of scriptural interpretation. So
what we said was pretty simple but important stuff. I reminded
Bob that God loves us all, and that He knows exactly where we are
and what is going on, and that He would make sure we all got out
safely. Bob and I prayed together several times, asking for
strength, courage and comfort for the three of us at the bottom
and for Mike's safety as he went for help. We also praised God
because we knew He would bring us all through this ordeal.
Although I can write about this very spiritually now,
at the time we weren't just sitting at ease saying, "Oh well, God
will make everything just rosey." We knew Bob's and Pete's lives
depended on the rescue. I was scared and worried about when the
rescue would get there and Bob could not concentrate on anything
except the pain. The last and probably most important reason that
we talked about Christianity is that it is something we have in
common, that is important to both of us. However, we did not talk
about Christianity all fo the time. About half way through the
wait, Pete found a mouse and we talked about the mouse for a while.
Bob always thought he heard people talking at the top of the pit,
but it was just the waterfall and he constantly asked "where are
they," "when will the rescue get here?" Despite their pain,
neither Bob nor Pete ever asked "why me?" or "How could God let
this happen?" They held together and made my task as easy as it
could have been, for which I am very grateful. Thank you all.

Bill forgot to mention the fact that Pete told him to
clam up as soon as he began singing, (supposedly to comfort us).
True it is, that prayer and the mouse talk got us through, but
Bill will definitely have to take voice lessons. The pain I felt
(mostly nerve damage), was so severe that if you were to run a blade
of grass across my chest, I would have been screaming for mercy.
In my own head, I did ask. God "why the pain?! After the operation
it was finally gone. I thank you all for being so gentle with me
in the cave. I also especially thankyou for accepting Bill and I
into your hearts and I love you all for saving our lives.
