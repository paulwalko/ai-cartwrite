physician's OK. Any prescription drug (epinephrine, hydrocortizone, -

Question: Who is in charge of a cave rescue?
Technically, in the state of Virginia, the law enforce-
ment agency is in charge of any rescue. They realize, in most
cases, that they have limited training and equipment and therefore
delegate the responsibility to the rescue and/or fire departments.
Fortunately, in Virginia, we are well on the way to convincing
these organizations that cavers need to be responsible for at
least the extrucation of the patient if not more. Therefore, there
must be a cooperative effort between the three groups (Law
enforcement, fire/rescue, and cavers). A law in Virginia that
backs up this need for cooperation is: NO ONE (not even a doctor,
lawyer or indian chief) can disrupt a rescue in process.
Violation of this law can result in their removal from the rescue,
and/or fine and/or imprisonment.
There are surely more questions that need to be answered
concerning medical treatment underground and its legal implications.
Please send any suggestions or questions to the VPI Cave Club.
I will make every effort to obtain the answer from the appropriate
officials. It is only by asking, that we, as cavers, can learn
how to give the best medical treatment to those who need it
underground.
