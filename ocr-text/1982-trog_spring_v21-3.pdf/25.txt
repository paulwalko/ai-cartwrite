WHICH WAY OUT ?
I had turned down three previous chances to go caving in Skydusky Hollow
because of previous commitments (hangovers, etc.), so when Pete Sauvigne asked
me to go to Buddy Penley's cave, I could not refuse. As popular as Skydusky
Hollow is with the club, I knew I would have a good time, and Pete had always
taken me on good trips. (The only reason Pete was going caving was because
he said the weather was going to be bad and he couldn't go hang-gliding. ) :
The next morning (after "Party on the Mountain") Pete, Bill Kelly and his.
friend Bob Ulfers and I got together and headed to Buddy's. It seemed as
though Bill and I always wound up on the same trips. After shooting the breeze
and watching a dozen or more piglets pull a vacuum on mama-pig for a while, we
headed up the mountain for the entrance. A few pops of the lamps and in we.
went. Pete and Bill traded the lead on the upper level, while I watched Bob
make things look easy ahead of me.
The upper level of that cave is a maze of passageways, Pete said once
he had gotten "lost" .on the way out for a while. He had been to Buddy's a
half dozen times or so. After a half hour we came to the "chest compressor".
Pete made it look easy, if you're tall and thin. I looked at it, and looked
at it, and looked at it. I tried it. I backed out. I looked at it. Etc.,
etc. ad nauseum, Pete said "C'mon fat boy!" That did it; I pushed in. I
sucked it in, I stopped and took a breath. A few cycles and I got through,
Bill and Bob followed.
Pete did a nice rig at the top of the 120' pit. Bill's PMI was 200', so
Pete rigged some extra length down to the constriction in the drop approximately
30 feet below. That was for someone to station themselves there for communica-
tions between top and bottom if the waterfall should prove to be too noisy.
It wasn't bad then, bá»¥t. Pete said it might be worse on the way out. (It was
supposed to rain, right?) Pete went down first, I got lasty's. At the bottom
we went and did the 30' cable ladder drop, and then went on to the crossover
pit. I actually enjoyed that (That must have been when I first wet my pants!)
After a little exploring for the "theoretical" Newberry's connection we turned
around, a total of approximately 4 hours after entering,
Bill had a little trouble returning over the crossover pit, I had trouble
at the ladder climb and Bob... didn!t have any trouble. Next thing we were at
the pit, unfortunately at the bottom. The waterfall was now twice as loud;
Pete had called that one right. Pete asked me to go up first and rig-in at
the constriction 90' from the floor (on the rigged tail of the main rope) to
be the communicator, I had borrowed John Lohner's cam rig, and Pete helped
me get fixed up. Up I went, WOW ! So easy! I'll never use knots again.
Ten minutes later and I was at the edge of the constriction, Up over the edge
and over to the left to rig in. *****KABOOM!*****
That was an extremely loud carbide lamp pop, I thought to myself. I heard
Pete utter a few choice words, then he yelled that we needed a rescue. I
thought that surely he was joking. I asked him if he was, TWICE. He said no,
he wasn't kidding; he had a broken arm and Bob was knocked out. He asked me
if I thought I could make it and I said yes. He yelled back that his keys
were under the right rear bumper of his Scout. I asked if he was in pain and
he said he would be okay. Bill was not hurt.
