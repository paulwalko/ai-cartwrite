THE EDITORS
EXPOUND...
Four score and seven years ago (or so it seems),
we were talking with Ken Bonenberger, the last TPOG editor,
at one of those essential Friday night parties. It being as
good or better than most, and us being the drunken sots that
we are, and Kenny finally graduating and ... well, enough of
excuses already ... SOMEHOW we got stuck with the indescrib-
able pleasure of producing this, the first Jim and Maureen
edition of the Tech Troclodyte.
Thanks, as usual, poes to all the little people
who helped us out with artwork: Chris, Keith, Ed, Nancy,
and Pat.: Our apologies for any obvious plagiarisms. We were
Hell-bent on producing a quality rap, and no copyright was
going to stop us.
The articles we received this quarter were of a
quality that surpassed all but a few of our wildest dreams.
Herein lies a definitive anthology on the anatomy of a rescue
from Buddy Penley's Cave, Trip reports from many strange
places round out the calendar of events, along with rare
examples of a brand of humor known only to cavers. Keep up
the good work, people, and keep those cards and letters cominÄ™.
