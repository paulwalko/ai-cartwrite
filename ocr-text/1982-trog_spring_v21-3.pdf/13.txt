Into The Mist...

The first time that I heard of Ellison's cave was in
1979. Having the deepest drop in the United States (Fantastic.
Pit, 586' free), plus the extraordinary passages lined with
gypsum crystals and moonmilk powder, Ellison's was, and still is,
a cave to visit.
After buying 600' of PMI, christened "Big Bertha,'" I
planned a week of caving and R & R for spring
break, March 21-28, 1982, with four friends of
mine: David Coakley, Paul Donahue, of Core Labs
from Venezuela, Eric Anderson, and John Burcham,
a "trainee", but talented caver to be respected.
We had been vertical caving together for the
past two years in southwest Virginia and during
this past winter quarter, we put in some day
and half day trips into Banes Spring for prep-
aration. Banes Spring is truly a fun, masoch-
istic cave: two hours of crawlways and assorted
obstacles followed by pits varying from 1001 to
2001 free (Whistling Wells). One trip to be '
noted was after a day in the cave, my car would
not start in sub-zero weather with strong winds,
thus Dave and I froze our asses without heat
until rescueres came to our aid.
After a week of exams, we crammed a few
hundred pounds of rope, vertical gear, camping
equipment, food, and beer into the Anderson's '.
VW van, a true cavemobile. During the eight
hour drive to Georgia, we had a jolly time
drinking Wieds', bullshitting and listening to
Hendrix and Rush tunes. After getting directions
and the key to the campsite from two nice officers
at the Lafayette Police Station, we drove to
Bluebird Springs at the base of Pigeon Mountain.
Paul, just up from Palm Beach, arrived at the
campsite, around 10pm and was ready to go caving.
We woke up the following morning, drowsy
from emotions, too much Weids', and stuffing
ourselves with food the night before. After
Paul and I found, the cave, Dave and John carried
Big Bertha and gear up the mountain. Paul and I
trudged up to the cave with more equipment a big
an hour later. Eric was feeling "under the
weather" and elected to go on the next trip.
