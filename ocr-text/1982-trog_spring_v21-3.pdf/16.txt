Fantastic Pit is especially fun: going through the mist and fog
of the waterfall, viewing the falls itself, and the bouncing of
the rope by John 100" or so below me. Traversing the straddle :
canyon on the way out seemed a little awkward, but fun. One more
ascent and we were out!!! Coming out of Ellison's, into the warm
outdoors, seeing the blue sky and breathing in the spring air was
a powerful feeling. Walking down Pigeon Mountain was anticlimatic
but nevertheless, we had just shared the best 21 hours of caving
we had ever had.
After a day of relaxing sleep, sloshing down many beers,
and stuffing our faces with food, we were ready to cave again.
After hearing us boast about Ellison's, Eric decided to go caving
eventhough he was still not feeling well. I told him, "Eric, the
hardest part of the trip is walking up the fuckin' mountain," and
that lifted his spirits. Six to seven hours in the cave found us
again at the "W76 Junction," ready to look for the "Hall For the
Giants," some half a mile of cave away. That is mile, turned out
to be the largest passage we have ever encountered, sometimes the
size of 2-4 lane roads. The reason we did not reach the "Hall for
the Giants" in ten minutes, was that we had to pick our way on top
of big breakdown slabs. Also there are some fascinating features
along the way that caught our attention.
One such example is "The White Room," an amazing room
filled with "White mud." Eric and John were so obsessed with the
white stuff that they had to be dragged from the room. Not far
from the room is a wall with the largest dogtooth spar crystals
that we have ever seen, they were the size of our hands! Finding
the "Pop Up" was easy enough, and soon ew came out on a balcony
over looking "Incredible Dome Pit," some 100' off of the floor.
The amount of water pouring down Incredible made the falls of
Fantastic look small. Going through the "Devil's Trapdoor Climb"
we entered a trunk passage with various side leads. We found the
"Bloody Crawl," and contrary to its name, and to our disappointment,
it is a fairly wimpy crawl.
Running down "The Pass", I heard John's echos up ahead,
"The Hall of the Giants..Giants..Giants." Sure enough, he had
found it. I entered a monstrous room, 300' long, 80' wide and up
to 60' high. I nearly flipped out at the size. One we explored
and rested for an hour, we cruised back to Fantastic and out of
the cave. Having all of the ropes rigged beforehand made this
trip a quick and enjoyable 19 hours.
After another days rest and having "volunteered" Eric
to go back into the cave with me, we pulled up the ropes. At the
top of* the warm up pit on the way out, we met the only other
"cave traffic" of the whole week; three local novice cavers, who
were just in to do the straddle canyon. The next morning, at the
campsite, they told us that one of the rusty bolts at the straddle
canyon had popped off with just a tug; some thing to remember for
the next trip.
So ends a memorable spring vacation and back to cold
Blacksburg. We would like to thank Mr. and Mrs. Anderson for
letting us trash up their VW, and to the police officers of
Lafayette, who gave us a hand with their warm southern hospitality.
