Answers To A Few Medical - Legal Questions Raised At :.
The Buddy's Rescue
The cave rescue in Buddy Penley's cave, April 17-18,
brought out some medical-legal aspects never considered before by
cavers. It has only been in the last 2-3 years, that the medical
teams involved in: 80.a.v.e rescue, 'routinely have included people
qualified above the level of EMT (emergency medical technician).
These "advanced life support" personnel ( from now on these will
be called ALS personnel) work directly with a hospital and ER
physician by way of radio or telephone. They also work under
"standing orders" and protocol. Standing orders and protocol
vary even within the State of Virginia... So it was not surprising
that there was some confusion involved in the medical management
of both patients in the Buddy Penley accident. To clarify some
of the questions brought up, the following people were asked for
their opinions: Dr. Surrcesco, Medical Director for the 4th
planning district, the Attorney General's office and Dr. Kelsey,
head of the Health Department in the State of Virginia. This
article is by no means a comprehensive statement concerning
medical practices underground, but the tip of the iceberg.
It is hoped that by summer's end, first, an official letter
commenting on the advanced life support treatment of the two
patients in the Buddy Penley cave rescue will be sent and second,
a formal statewide protocol and standing orders for medical
treatment underground, initially for Nationally Registered
Paramedics, will be written. It must be realized that the follow-
ing and facts are true only for the State of Virginia.
Question: What is the medical role of an EMT at a cave
rescue in Virginia.?
The EMT (Nationally registered or certified by the
state) can administer basic life support i.e. basic first aid.
They can perform any medical technique taught to them. They are
invaluable in helping to stabilize patients, monitor vital signs,
and as an all-around medical "go-for." If they are the highest
qualified medical personnel, they can only leave the patient; if
responsibility is given to another EMT or someone more medically
qualified.
Question: What is the medical role of an IV technician,
Shock Trauma Technician, Cardiac Technician or Paramedic at a cave
rescue?
These personnel can administer advanced lifesupport
according to the standing orders and protocol set up by the
Medical Directorate covering the area in which the cave rescue
takes place. Possible advanced lifesupport treatment that can be
givengl. is IV therapy, drug therapy, airway management (by EOA or
ET tube), defibrillation (highly unlikely underground), fracture
and dislocation reduction and other techniques. Please realize
that the levels listed above are not qualified to give all of the
above treatment. Each level has its limitations. Standing orders
in an area are written doctor's orders concerning the treatment
of various emergencies. These orders allow the various ALS
personnel to perform specific treatment of the patient without
