Grotto Grapevine
Spring break saw a group grope from the grotto speeding
down I-81 to do some pot-holing in Alabama and Tennessee. They
did Kaigle's Chasm, Valhalla, Neversink, The Sinkhole and South
Pittsburgh Pit. There was also a trip to Ellison's by Frank Gibson
and company. Bill Stephens made a comeback over spring break
when he met Ben Keller, Philip, Win, Stymie, John Mummery and
Carol Trexler for a mapping trip to Roppel,
Spring quarter started off with one of the cavers favor-
ite pasttimes -- mudslinging. Not in caves, of course, but during
elections. Rising through the muck and mire as president was
Steve "Stymie" Conner. He ran unopposed, but was not spared any
muck. This year's question was not "Who is Evelyn Bradshaw?" but
rather, "Are you a quiche-eater?" Keith "Animule" Smith was
elected vice-president because of his priorities--caving first,
schoolwork second. Jim Washington was voted in as secretary and
Carol Trexler, treasurer. Ken Bonenburger found that if you raise
your hand you get appointed mail-bag.
Big John and Animule held Jerry Redder's birthday party.
Keith invented his newest Advanced-Intensive-Effects Drinking
game called "Oops!", for the occasion. Bob and Chris Amundson
were married during the quarter and had a reception party at Doug
Perkin's house, Ken and Brenda were married a few weeks later in
West Virginia where 12 gallons of liquor were consumed at the
reception. Ed Loud left bumper marks on a parked trailer. VAR was
held that same weekend, in Abington, VA. At the region meeting,
many tongues were sunburned, but it was remarked how nicely
dressed the chairman and vice-chairman were.
Back in the "real" world of cave crickets, trickle streams
and muddy survey tapes, Jozo and Carolzo are still going strong in
Newberry's. Lawrence Britt has taken a couple of diddey pole trips
into Starnes and has that cave over 5500 feet. Bob Amundson has
McClung's over 16 miles. Some club members got to go on a rare
sport trip into Butler cave. Phantom has been on the prowl and has
been seen dragging sherpas into Perkin's, Newberry's and New River
taking photos for Time-Life. History does repeat itself; Glen Davis
has been seen accompanying him.
Everything seems to be going well after the rescue in
Buddy Penley's cave. Bob Ulfers is up and around and has his foot
cast off. Pete Sauvigne has both arm casts off and has discovered
that the metal plates in his arms do not affect a Brunton needle
(damn that bad luck, right Pete?) Someobservations after the
rescue: Stymie's space shuttle LTD, which blew a heat tile on the
drive to Penley's, was the scene, of a drink-till-you-pass-out party
after the rescue. This was followed by a lay-in-the-sun-till-you-
pass-out party at Lawrence's apartment. Mike Moore says his next
cave trip will be to Luray Caverns.
New members this quarter were Bev Wilson (249), Dave
