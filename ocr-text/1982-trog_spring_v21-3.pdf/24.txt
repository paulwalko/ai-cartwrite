Most of the time, we VPI cavers
prefer to sit back on our laurels and think,
"How technically excellent we arel" Sometimes
this is with good reason, considering the
enviable safety record the club has enjoyed.
This Spring, however, an unfortunate accident
occurred on a Cave Club sponsored trip.
The next few pages constitute our
attempt to put it all together--the hows and
the whys of the rescue at: Buddy Penley's
Cave. It is (we think) altogether fitting
to begin the rescue antholocy at the begin-
ning of the rescue as it was for the rescuers--
the dreaded phone call.
"Walt, telephone."
"Okay, I'll get it in here --- Hello?"
"That you walt?"
"Yep"
"Hi, this is Glenn."
(Clenn? oh oh!!) "Hi, Clenn-- What's up?"
"Well, our trip in Buddy Penley's has had some
problems."
(Figures. There goes my Saturday night party!)
"What kind of problems?" (Hope it's just
another missed ETA)
"Well, apparently, one climber knocked down
a rock. Pete has a broken arm at the bottom
of the drop, and a trainee is unconscious. I
don't know more than---" :
(SHIT!! in Buddy's? This one's really going
to be hell) "Okay, what's the scenario?"
("Had some problems," he says. SHIT)
"Well, the scenario is-- getyourassandgearov-
ertoLawrence'sasfastasyoucanhaulit."
"Okay, Glenn, 'bye and thanks" (Yeah, thanks!!)
And we were off on the Big One.
