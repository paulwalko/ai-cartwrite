got blown .
away drink-
ing cheap wine
and Walt was
well on his way
after drinking
a bottle of Jack
: Black with John
Mapel. John was
convinced to come
and party with us
after we promised
him that someone
would carry him home
afterward. Our last
night was definitely
one to remember after
two days of bouncing
pits. Monday morning,
we woke up hungover
and happy. We packed
up our gear and left ;
for Valhalla. Valhalla
was our deepest pit, measuring 2201 on the low side. It was
definitely an 'awsome pit, Jerry Redder was again bombarded with
rocks and debris at the bottom. After everyone was out of the
pit, we were entertained by a streaking Chuck Shorten. At 3:00pm
we left Valhalla with wonderful memories and finally rolled into
Blacksburg Tuesday morning, all wonderfully tired and happy.
