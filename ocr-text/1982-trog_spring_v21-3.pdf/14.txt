the 70's. But we all wanted to go caving, blue sky or not!
... The entrance of Ellison's consists of a 51 climb down
onto the "Ecstasy", a big passage with a stream flowing down it.
After ten minutes of walking we were at the "Warm-up Pit." Dave
and I, with slings and biners, rigged 'little bertha'to three : ....
ceiling bolts. It is a beautiful 720' free drop with a waterfall
301 beside the rappel route. Once we were all down, our next
obstacle was the stradle canyon with exposure varying from 201
to.701. Using the bolts, we rigged a tyrolean across the .canyon
for a self-belay. The stradle is easy but after a long cave
trip, it may be tricky to a bleary-eyed caver.
Then we were there, the "Attic Room" with Fantastic Pit.
patiently waiting for us. We sat quietly while one of us dropped
a good sized rock through the "keyhole"; it was the sweetest 7
second whistle that we ever heard. Once Big Bertha was rigged
and lowered through the 2' diameter hole, i descended into the
depths of fantastic. The feeling was funny; I had the same sensa-
tion twenty years ago as a kid on a X-Mas morning. Once over the
lip, I felt Bertha's weight; "Heavy bitch," I said to myself. I
could see the blackness beneath me with the roar of the waterfall
breaking the silence. 1 rappelled "Ali Baba" mode, dressed in
Hefty trash bags and looking like an Arab sheik in case the abseil
went into the waterfall. At about 70 feet down, the waterfall was
in view, and I immediately rappelled into another dimension: into
the mist. 1 cranked my carbide lamp on full, just barely able to
see the walls of the pit around me. The only way that I could judge
how fast it was descending was by watching the rope being squeezed
through the rack, l'he wet rope cooled my rack sufficiently so that
I could control it with my bare left hand to the bottom; a water.
cooled descent! The mist was not bad; it made the descent more in-
teresting. After 8 minutes or so, I reached bottom and was ready
to belay the next person. Communication by voice was very difficult
due to the waterfall, so we used whistles with a set of prescribed
calls. Once the other three reached the bottom, we quickly signed
the soaking wet register and boogied out of IAG Hall.
Locating the correct lead to the Broken Dome was amazingly
one of the few route-finding difficulties on the entire trip. We
spent 45 minutes looking for it! Dave, with luck, found the "hole"
in the wall near the Stream Junction that led to the spacious room.
Before going to the Gypsum Room, we lounged for half an hour, munch-
ing out and looking at our maps and compass. The time spent reading
route descriptions and deciphering the maps of the cave before Spring
break reduced the time for finding key landmarks to a minimum.
Back in Virginia, crawlways mean "grunting", but those of
the Gypsum Koom are of an outstanding quality. Surrounding us were
glistening gypsum crystals and hair with moonmilk giving a touch of
white. Cnristmas. We popped into a large trunk passage, one of the
hallmarks of Ellison's. We ran down it and entered the "Snowbait
vome Room." It is a large cylindrical room with a unique feature-
the "Snowwall", a white spherical flowstone formation atop a mud-
• rock pedestal, the size of a huge caver. To reach an upper level,
we had to locate the "Crystal Junction." It is an 8' slab climb
