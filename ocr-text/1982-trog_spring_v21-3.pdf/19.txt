Crystal Cave California
Searching for a River of Gold
In the far eastern section of San Bernardino county,
California, lies a cave system, rich in legend for its supposed
river of gold. The main cave in the system, Crystal Cave,
lies on Kokoweef Peak, in the Ivanpah mountains, about 60 miles,
southwest of Las Vegas. The cave's original discoverers were a
group of three Paiute indians in the early part of this century.
Inside the cave, they found a large stream, along whose banks lay
thick black sand, rich with gold. Unfortunately, one of the
three indians was killed in a fall inside the cave - one victim
of at least five to have perished inside. The two remaining
indians passed on their knowledge to a young boy living nearby.
In the early 1930's, Earl Dorr remembered the tales told to him as
a child and proceeded to investigate the cave. In a sworn
affidavit on file in Los Angeles County, Earl Dorr gives a detailed
description of what he found and then hid, possibly forever. He
describes a 300' chasm, upon whose bottom runs a large stream
containing gold bearing sands. He describes how the passages to
this canyon were blasted shut in at least two places after he .
learned of others who knew of his secret. However, legend in the
area says that Earl Dorr sealed alive two prospectors when he
dynamited these passages. As late as 1959, two more amateur
prospectors were killed in the cave from blasting fumes.
I had read several articles in magazines dating from the
early 1960's about Earl Dorris legendary find. I was surprised
to find, however, that a local surplus store owner in Las Vegas,
who had a fantastic selection of caving packs, was the owner of the
modern day Crystal Cave mining "company." During the end of March
I decided to visit the cave since I was told that visitors,
especially cavers, were welcome. Snow still covered the dirt
roads as we wound our way from the 5000 foot elevation, where we
left the only paved highway in the area. Even in March, the
Mojave desert was a cool 60 degrees. At the base of Kokoweef
mountain, I introduced myself to the sole prospector inhabiting
the base camp that day. He was overjoyed to take a caver
through Crystal and was even willing to provide the equipment!
The main cave itself, consists of a natural entrance,
300 feet above a man made tunnel entrance. The tunnel was dug
to lay tracks for mine cars, in order to more easily bring out
mining debris. After walking down the tunnel for several
hundred feet, we proceeded up a 155 foot aluminum ladder, bolted
to the wall of another man made passage. The top of this ladder
climb ends at the base of the main entrance pit. A steel cable
ladder, that used to be used aboard a freighter, is rigged from
the natural entrance 120 feet above the base of this pit.
Numerous breakdown routes snake upward around to the natural
entrance, reminding me of the Devil's staircase in Newberry's.
At the base of the pit, is the primary motivating
