set up by different areas to cover medical management of certain
emergencies. They state, for instance, the order of treatment for
a particular illness or injury and they may state at what stage of
management to stop and call the physician. In Virginia, there is
a wide range of protocols and standing orders. It will be impor:
tant for future rescues to know what protocols and standing orders
exist in the region. It is also important to realize, that any
of the ALS personnel may receive and execute verbal orders from a
physician, so long as they do not exceed their training. ALS: :.
personnel may only turn over the resposibility of a patient to an
equally or higher qualified medical person...
Question: Who is legally responsible for the medical
actions taken by ALS personnel?
If medical treatment is performed according to local
standing orders and protocol, legal responsibility lies with the
local medical director. If treatment is performed according to
verbal orders, responsibility lies with the physician who issued
the order.
Question: What is the medical role of a nurse (RN) at
a cave rescue? .
This question was not addressed.
Question: What is the medical role of a physician at a
cave rescue ?
There are two roles a physician can play. First, he
can remain outside the cave evaluating the patient's condition,
and giving orders when needed. Point of interest; if the physi-
cian gives an order to the ALS person that is contradictory to
their protocol the personnel can question and/or refuse the order.
(This may happen when either a non caving doctor requests treatment
that is not feasible underground or the doctor is unfamiliar with
the emergency medical techniques or the doctor is unfamiliar with
the capabilities of the underground medical personnel.) The
second role the physician may take on is actual emergency medicine
provider. If he is capable of reaching the patient, he can
assume full responsibility. Two problems come up with this role.
First, if the underground physician gives an inappropriate order
(as exampled above), the ALS personnel must cease treatment and let
the physician have sole responsibility. The second possible
problem with having a physician underground, is that he can only
turn responsibility of a patient over to another physician.
Technically, if the rescue took 24 hours and the physician was
there from the beginning, he must stay with the patient all.:24 !
hours or risk being sued for abandonment (unless by fate there
were two caving physicians at the scene). The Buddy Penly accident
i brought up another technicality concerning abandonment. If a..
physician had treated both patients at the bottom of the drop, how
would he have maintained treatment of both patients during
extrication? To climb the pit with one patient would leave the
other without treatment, technically this is abandonment.
Extrication of both patients at the same time would have been
impossible.
Question: Can pain medication and/or other medication
be given underground?
Any drug not covered under standing orders, requires a
