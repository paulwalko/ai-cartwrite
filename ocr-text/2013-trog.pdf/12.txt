The Sewer
By Nick Socky
Sometimes a place is named
for a reason, and the wise stay away!
WE were not the wise. Well actually
a few of us were, but the decision be-
tween getting lost in a maze for a
long time, or traveling through a lin-
ear seemingly simple crawl, was tak-
en to a vote. AND the decision to go into the seemingly simple crawl was made.
It was a beautiful day outside. The birds were chirping the sun was shining; all was
perfect with the world. My friends and I had decided to instead of spending out day
outside hiking, throwing a Frisbee, or basking in the sun, to go caving. Why we do
this, nobody knows, but it's just the caver way. We had made our way to Bath
County to enter the Maze of Crossroads cave. In reality even though the sun was
shining, it is January and it was pretty damn cold outside. We all quickly got
changed; we made for the entrance, ice-telagtites hanging around the crack in the
wall and entered the warm darkness.
