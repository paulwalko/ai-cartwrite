Ode to the cave Club Suite
Based on The Raven by Edgar Allan Poe
By John Mulheren
Once upon a midmorn dreary, I awoke all weak and weary,
in the living room of the cave Club Suite from a party the night before,
Terrible pain within my head, my stench could have surely raised the dead,
With myself I vainly plead, I shall not drink here anymore,
For this lifestyle I was not bred, I shall not drink here anymore,
Last night was it, now nevermore.
Friend, you should have seen the room, it could have passed for a tomb,
I was surrounded by the bodies of my friends strewn across the floor,
I suppose last night, it was a blast, “Turn it down!" the neighbors asked,
And oh, how they then were harassed, then we danced til we were sore,
I believe I may just need a cast, for i danced last night til i was sore,
Man, I tore up that dance floor.
The night did have some casualties, you should have seen that balcony,
Dead soldiers littered every surface, this truly was a horrid war,
My bathroom floor is covered in vomit, how did some get in my closet?
A dreadful place for your deposit, cleaning this place will be such a chore,
You drank so much and then you lost it, this cleaning will be such a chore,
Your lunch makes a quite poor décor!
cave Club Suite, you served us well, but how could we ignore the smell,
Your dirty carpet, spray-painted wall, the damages will take eons to restore,
Despite this I still loved you so, I'm heartbroken to see you go,
It gives me great pleasure to know, we used you like a dirty whore
You have some scars that clearly show, we used you like a dirty whore
And that is all we could ask for.
