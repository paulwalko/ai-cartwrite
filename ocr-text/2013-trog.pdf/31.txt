the Kingdom Fungi managed to infiltrate the gear, so the de-
cision was made to look for a more secure indoor home. Sam
Lambert, who also is the de facto cave rescue specialist with
the Blacksburg Rescue Squad, stepped up to the plate and is
now storing the rescue cache at her new house, located in
Blacksburg at 400 Murphy Street. The gear is located in a
room on the left side of the house if you are looking up from
HIVIO
the road. A green door and bat Sticker mark the room. Most
of the gear is hanging or stacked to the right side of the
room. Sam can be contacted by phone @ 540-641-1306 or
email Sam.lambert03@gmail.com. Thanks, Sam!
Although the rescue gear has been cleaned, organized, and moved to its new home, there are still several updates in
progress. Eric Stanley is leading the modernization of the initial response or “bash” kits to make them easier to carry
and more efficient. Eric and Steve Wells are building a better spider, the rigging which secures the litter to a vertical
haul system. And members are looking into a new patient helmet, patient harness, and radios. On the subject of
communication, thanks go to Phil Benchoff and Ray Sira for testing and refurbishing the field phones, as well as
putting together documentation on their use. This documentation resides with the phones in the gear cache so it will
be available during an actual rescue. Captain Ed also organized and led an outdoor highline rigging practice session at
Dave C's place on November 10. About 25 folks spanning experience levels from old fart to trainee came out and
worked together to rig a 100+ foot highline, successfully moving a weighted stokes litter from the bottom of a steep
gulley to the rig point. This gave the trainees in particular a chance to see why pulley systems are important, and
how paper diagrams translate into real world rigs. Everyone learned something new. For example, many thought the
self-minding prussik safety that Deighan
integrated into the system was really cool.
The club held its annual (at least in con-
cept) practice rescue the weekend of No-
vember 30-December 2. This year, the
club opened the event to participants out-
side of the grotto, including three National
Cave Rescue Commission (NCRC) trained
cave rescuers - Doug Moore and Carroll
Bassett from West Virginia and Alan
Staton, a Blue Ridge Grotto Caver and EMS
professional from Covington. These are the
