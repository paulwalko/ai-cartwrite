Some caving, lots of drink-
ing, but I think one of the
most notable events of
this picnic was John
George up for member-
ship. I think that we all en-
joyed harassing JG with so
many questions in the
form of screams that he
couldn't actually hear
any of them individually.
But, for all his tolerance,
he did get to be carried
the furthest distance by
the largest group of
women of anyone
that I have seen vot-
101
ed in. Look at that
lucky stud, I didn't
even know we had
that many girls in the
Cave Club.
