Banquet 2013 by A...Cartwright
Banquet weekend kicked off Friday February 15th with a Speleo-Seminar
at Samantha Lambert's new house. A potluck dinner and outdoor fire made
for a cheery evening. The young folks were wailing and crying when Saman-
tha kicked them out at mid-nite. Based on neighbor complaints, it must have
been a good party.
Saturday night Banquet was held at the University Club on Campus. Alt-
hough the weather was cold and windy, the usual 8 inches of snow only fell
as flurries. While attendance was somewhat lower than expected, we still
had 98 people show up. Much appreciation to Zenah Orndorff for the Cock-
tail Party Soiree, Club Treasurer Brian McCarter for keeping the purse strings
tight and Hillary Schmitthenner and Kyle Mills for chipping in. Laine Buckwal-
ter was our liaison to the competent and efficient University Club. Ray Sira
provided an excellent slide show of cavers past and present with slides pro-
vided by Richard Cobb and Brian McCarter. It was nice to see that the only
thing that has changed in 70 years in the Cave Club is our waistlines. Naomi
Orndorff kept the dancing music going to the wee hours. Alex Booker made
sure no one went
thirsty. He even
hauled a keg on
his back through
the blowing snow.
The pi√±ata made
another appear-
ance, but wasn't
as tough as last
year.
