The rescue system in New Zealand is also much
different. Search and Rescue is free and is run
by the NZ Police using teams of specialist vol-
unteer group under the umbrella of a volunteer
Rescue Trust (LANDSAR). CaveSAR is one of the
specialist groups but because of the limited
number of cavers most cavers are automatical-
ly part of CaveSAR, if not as a caver then as sur-
face support. The government and grants pay
for training and rescue gear, including
US$10,000 to fly cavers in for a national 3-day
exercise once every three years. All the gear is kept in the local SAR store. Cavers will work from the Police Station
in the area where the rescue is taking place. Most of the caving in the South Island happens in the Tasman Police
District so the cavers have built up an excellent relationship with the Police SAR sergeant.
Every year the NZ cavers have a SAREX or Search and Rescue Exercise. I was fortunate to observe one earlier during
my stay here. Having the SAR sergeant around is helpful in that people like Steve Wells don't have to throw people
like Wil Orndorff under the bus the moment they come out of the cave. Since the police handle all the interaction
with the press, there is no reason to try and avoid reporters. The downside of this strategy is that it would cause
Wil less consternation, which I find hilarious.
Another side effect of the SAR sergeant is that the cops wouldn't try a cave rescue by themselves as has been
known to happen in the states. The particular sergeant I had the pleasure to talk to said that after seeing what we
were doing that he wouldn't even dream of going into a cave.
For the few large alpine rescues the
Police can call in the Royal New
Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) for
transport. The RNZAF are just at
the end of the era of using Huey
Iroquois helicopters to carry the
cavers and their gear to a forward
base on the mountain. These are
the same choppers you see in mov-
ies such as â€œApocalypse Now." New
Zealand is in the process of upgrad-
ing its helicopter fleet, but I digress.
