When a radiation burst is released, radioactive particles travel through some materials but reflect off others
that are too dense. When picked up by the probe, the reflected particles create an image. When North Korea
set off their nuclear device, the probes placed in South Korea were able to create and show x-ray images of
the underground pockets and passages of the Korean Peninsula. From this amazing discovery, U.S. caver
scientists began conducting tests to create a small nuclear emitter and probe to help survey caves and dis-
cover new passage in existing caves.
The Gamma Probe works with—and creates—alpha, beta, and gamma particles. The probe first cre-
ates a small nuclear microburst from a plutonium core. When fired, a filter acts as a “flow straightener,” and
all the particles are evenly emitted through a palladium nozzle. These emitted particles travel through the air
medium until they are reflected by a material they cannot pass through. Each set of particles reflects differ-
ently to each different strata and type of rock the cave is formed in. Alpha particles are used to map a major-
ity of open passage because they will reflect off all mud and rock. Beta particles easily pass through mud
and other organic debris but reflect of rock formations. These results would show the length of specific mud
plugs and determine if they could produce potential digs. Gamma particles were the most interesting parti-
cles with the experiments performed. They responded most to the density of the rock, and if a rock face was
porous or thin, reflected results would show a darker area. However, if they reflected entirely, the result
would show white. These results were best used with finding thin walls to possible undiscovered cave pas-
sage as well as interesting research in using caves as bunkers in case of a nuclear attack.
