folks we encounter at rescues in the region that aren't being led by VPI, but
on which we assist. They brought a valuable outside perspective to our exer-
cise. We also had folks from the Blue Ridge and New River Valley grottoes par-
ticipate, as well as Josh Quesenberry of the Southwest Virginia Mountain Res-
cue Group, part of the Blacksburg Rescue Squad.
Programs at Friday night meetings for the few weeks leading up to the prac-
tice rescue covered a variety of rescue topics, and Alan Staton cave a prep talk
from his perspective on November 30. The scenario for the rescue was that on
Saturday morning Zenah Orndorff received a call from the Bat Ranch saying
that a spelunker named Bert from New Hampshire (played by Captain Ed) re-
ported his companion Ernie (played by Blacksburg Man) had fallen and was
injured in Tawneys Cave, somewhere near “a pipe” that went from the ceiling through the floor. For purposes of the
rescue simulation, the sinkhole entrance to Tawneys did not exist.
Frequently, VPI practice rescues are just litter handling exercises. However, based
on recent experiences at Bone Norman and Stay High, the club decided to per-
form a more holistic rescue simulation incorporating search, incident command,
and communications components. These were all things young VPI cavers en-
countered at the Bone Norman Search in 2012 and were not prepared to deal
with. In an effort to develop redundant expertise in various incident command
rolls, young members were cast in key rolls with folks experienced in those rolls
paired with them as advisors. Courtney Trost served as incident commander, ad-
vised by Carol Zo. Ed Fortney was guru to Brian McCarter as underground coordi-
nator. Several folks kept a watchful eye on Sarah Crowder, who ran the litter
crew. Joe Calderone led the rigging crew
with Joe Zo making sure the results were safe and efficient. Nick Socky led
the communications crew, which ran phone lines from the entrance into the
cave, which was in radio contact with incident command at the barn. Many
other people filled key functions as well - those listed here are to illustrate
how our younger members were integrated into leadership rolls.
From Ernie's perspective, things went flawlessly. Rescuers were calm and
attentive, and the ride was smooth. Orange juice squeezed by Marge Lewter
into Ernie's mouth particularly delighted him. All unusual movements of the
litter, including the haul system, were clearly explained to Ernie in advance.
And no one tried to shove a thermometer up his bum, although we are not
