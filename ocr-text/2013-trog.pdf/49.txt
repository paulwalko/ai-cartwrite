For those of you who have never been to Mexico, I'll give a
couple of the differences I've noticed so far. The food good,
and none of us have gotten sick so far, but the menu is often
inaccurate and you never really know what you can actually
order. The driving is pretty crazy. People rarely stay in the
lanes. There are checkpoints along the roads, but they mostly
just stand there and look intimidating.
More to come soon! We're relaxing in a hotel tonight and
we're all looking forward to hot sulfur pools and good Mexi-
can beer. Cheers!
P.S. Deighan wanted me to mention that it's really warm
hear. Have fun in Blacksburg :)
Rio Choy and New Year's Eve (1/1/13)
The first caving excursion we took was to Rio Choy, a 210 foot
vertical cave near Cuidad Valles. We woke up fairly early on
the morning of New Year's Eve, had breakfast, and made
the short drive from Hotel Taninul to the parking area. The
cave entrance is about a mile and a half from the road,
though the hike is made easy by some train tracks. The cave
itself is considered sacred because of a column that apparent-
ly looks like the Virgin Mary (I couldn't see it), but the cavern-
ous entrance is littered with trash. Frank, Bob, and Deighan
rigged the mainline to another rope to make the length more
easily adjusted, and the group began the repel. Though the
drop is short in comparison to the other pits we'll bounce on the trip, it is made exciting by the pool
of water at the bottom. This allowed us to short-rig the rope and repel off the end of it into the wa-
ter beneath. This year, we only short-rigged by about 6 feet, which is much shorter than in years
past. However, the amazing views of the bright blue water illuminated by a skylight and the op-
portunity to swim in warm cave water in December made the cave well worth the walk. Many of
us used the large rock protruding from the water as a highdive, and the rapids at the exit added
some excitement. Overall, nine of us did the drop and some did it multiple times.
