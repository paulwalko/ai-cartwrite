To Be a Bat Ranch Dog
By Katrina Stoll
Strangers come and go every day.
I have to be good and stay,
Chasing cars or barking too much is bad
GRILLAS
NOON
Even if it is a dogs fad.
We have lots of room to romp and play,
We like to act so cray.
There is also a creek great for swimming,
So our excitement and energy is always brimming.
When people come over,
We sometimes follow them through the fields of
clovers.
They disappear into some strange holes.
Dirty and exhausted, eons later they come out like
little moles.
Some nights, packs of people come.
They laugh and drink more than just a little rum.
Then they call our names,
And there's a lot of petting and rubbing for claims.
Nothing is better than wagging our tails and being happy
So don't ever get snappy.
Then we get to lie around and be like a hog.
This is the hardships of being a Bat Ranch Dog!
