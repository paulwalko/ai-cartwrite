sure he would have minded. In all seriousness, the rescuers took the simulation
seriously and treated Ernie with care and respect.
As is usually the case in actual rescues, there were some communication break-
downs. However, these were recognized and quickly fixed. Going over the pa-
perwork after the simulation, it became clear that note-taking could have been
done better. Everything was documented, but some key information was missing
from various forms - e.g. who was filling out the form, where they were sta-
tioned, et cetera. There is a tendency to downplay the importance of documen-
tation, but on long or complex incidents involving groups that don't normally
work together, keeping accurate records is really important. This is a place
where we could improve.
To be fair, part of the problem with documentation was due to the way the simulation was set up. The location and
time of the simulation were announced Friday night, and on Saturday unfortunately much of the incident command
crew actually showed up before the initial response team (aka “bash crew”), creating some temporary chaos. For ex-
ample, incident command did not know that Alan Staton was in the cave with Ernie despite the fact that it was clear-
ly documented on the entrance control log. The initial fustercluck was in some ways a great problem to have, since it
reflected everyone's eagerness to participate. However, for future such simulations it would be wise to make sure
the bash crew has been deployed before getting the masses to the site. Timing is everything.
On Sunday the club held a debriefing brunch at the Orndorff house, where everyone got a chance to offer comments
and suggestions from modifying and improving the club's performance. Everyone agreed the most impressive things
were the turnout, over 50 people including more than 40 from VPI, and the teamwork. Participants spanned the gen-
erations from Don Anderson to Naomi Orndorff, with Socky's spanning both grottos and generations. Folks from out-
side the VPI Cave Club probably got a better handle on our capacity, and our members got to meet other folks they
are likely to work with during actual cave search and rescue incidents.
To further our cave rescue capacity, seven folks from the club attended the
NCRC Orientation to Cave Rescue on March 8-10 in Lebanon, Virginia. While
many of the topics had already been covered in the fall, we all got extra prac-
tice and learned some new techniques, including revisions in patient packag-
ing. We also got a chance to meet numerous folks we'd be likely to encounter
in real cave rescues in extreme Southwest Virginia and Eastern Tennessee.
The VPI Cave Club has made significant strides during the last year to upgrade
our rescue preparedness and capability. Hopefully, we'll never need it. But
history suggests we will.
