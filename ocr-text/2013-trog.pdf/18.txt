My First Vertical Cave: Clover Hollow
By Aasim Rawoot
The last caving trip I was a part of happened to be my first
vertical caving trip. As a pretty new and prospective member of
the club I was pretty eager to finally have the opportunity to make
my first vertical descent and climb. The group was up bright and
early. It was a cold morning but luckily it was dry, I've heard Clo-

an even smaller one person passage leading down giving a “shimmering” view of some gypsum flow-
ers. One of the more experienced members immediately goes right through and comes back out
likes it's nothing talking about how amazing the flowers look. Me and another trainee got a little
giddy after hearing members talk about these flowers, and I take a go at it. I get down the little hole
and there they are! I didn't have to look around, because they were everywhere! I saw the reflection
of a granola bar wrapper in the dirt and it saddened me that someone littered on the beauties. After
a brief minute of looking I turn around to go back up, only problem is it looked like a huge struggle
getting up that wormhole of a tunnel. Grrrrr, a little tunnel that looked so easy to get through... and
