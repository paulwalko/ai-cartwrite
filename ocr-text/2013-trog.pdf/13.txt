We made our way from the entrance room into the entrance maze. We had a little bit of
fun there, trying to figure out where we were. As we looked at the map, we saw a part of
the cave called “The Sewer”. It didn't look that bad on the map; very linear section of the
cave, cannot really get lost in, and it lead us pretty deep in the cave too! We decided to
check it out. As we descended down through the Manhole and entered this lower section
of the cave, we saw why they called it the sewer. It was a small canyon like passage with
a gravely floor and a little bit of water, but manageable. We went further down this pas-
sage and then it took a slight right turn into a hand a knees crawl. With me leading I was
hoping we did not have to back out due to water. I crawled on my hands and knees; I
crawled for 5 whole minutes! And then I hit lots of water, so much water that I forced eve-
ryone behind me to back out. Then we looked at the map again and discovered that a
small crack up to the left instead was the right direction.
It was an incredibly tight fit into this small upper canyon area which gave the sew-
er its real name. This canyon which went on for approximately 400 feet was a tight nar-
row key hole like canyon. The shape of it forced you to have to canyon and crawl at the
same time. And to add to this, the walls and floor were both also sharp with frequent cave
popcorn. After the first 20 minutes in this passage, we all started regretting our decision
coming down to the sewer. Screaming comments were made, “its called the sewer for a
reason!”. Two members on the trip, John and Tommy started laughing hysterically when
they came around a slight bend to see the rest of
the passage: with the same crawly like canyon, but
with about a 10 foot section filled with water. That
is when the scream and cursing truly started. The
pool only seeming a few inches deep was actually
about 3 feet deep with a soupy muddy mix. From
the pool we crawled back up into the canyon. This
made it slippery for the last few people, but it was
still a sharp passage! So a lot of slipping and yell-
ing come from Daniel, Sarah, and I. This continued
for about another 50 to 100 feet and just when it
seemed that it wouldn't end, we finally broke into
the normal canyon passage. No more crawling! We
rejoiced! Sort of...
