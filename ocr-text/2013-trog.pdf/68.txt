Cavers Cheap Cocktail (apple wine)
Makes about 5 gal
This beverage is always a solid choice for cavers. This is a tasty apple wine recipe that makes a large amount for an
affordable price (less than $25 for 50 bottles depending where you buy the juice). This is also gluten free since there
seem to be quite a few cavers this year that cannot drink gluten stuff. If you're going to host a spelio this is always a
good thing to have around. On a side note, don't ask me what the alcohol content is of this stuff because my hydrometer
broke.
Ingredients:
21 quarts 100 % apple juice (ascorbic acid can be the only
additive)
7 14 tsp. citric acid
5 1 tsp. nutritional energizer
10 cups brown sugar
2 tsp. vanilla
1 packet of Red Star Champaign yeast
1 pound cranberries
Directions:
Sanitize everything. Use some bleach and water
or some other sanitizing agent you find in a store. Things
you will need to sanitize: your fermenter (bucket with a air
tight lid and a hole that fits your air lock), your air lock, hy-
drometer if you feel like taking the starting gravity (later
helps you figure out the alcohol content), thermometer
(helps correct hydrometer reading), a funnel might be
helpful while pouring, a spoon and bowl to prepare yeast if
packet directions call for it, and anything else you might
need.
Next pour all your juice, sugar, and cranberries
into a huge ass pot (one that can hold 21 quarts with some
room to boil). Then heat it (I wouldn't boil it) just to get all
the sugar dissolved. Then put in the citric acid and vanilla.
Wait until it cools and add the nutritional energizer as well. Then pour all that juice into your fermenter (using a funnel
will help you not spill juice all over your floor, unless you want apple juice all over your floor?) Oh, and take your first
gravity reading with your hydrometer if you want to. When it's at the temperature the yeast packet calls for pitch your
yeast. Put on your air lock and fill that with a bit of water.
Put the fermenter in a dark spot in your house that is a good temperature for the yeast and wait. Hopefully you'll
see bubbles in the air lock within a day or so. If not, do research online. I think I let mine ferment for about a month or
so, but you have to be patient and wait at least a month (if you feel like it you can rack it during this time too).
Ok you've waited forever, now bottle. Oh and collect some bottles during your waiting time that are not twist off
(go through peoples recycling bins and beg people for bottles if you need them last minute). Before you bottle, sanitize
your bottles (dishwashers are great), your bottling equipment, your caps (buy those), hydrometer (find out that final gravi-
ty), bottling bucket, thermometer, and siphon. Take your final gravity reading if you took the starting one, and if you pre-
fer dry wine leave it as is, if you want sweet wine add a little corn sugar or brown sugar. Siphon your now alcoholic bev-
erage into your bucket then fill your bottles (bottle fillers are genius). Cap those bottles and yay you have alcohol. I'd
wait 2-3 weeks to drink it though just because it will probably taste better. Good luck, and I know this is really long and
confusing so be sure to use a lot of Internet for this endeavor. Feel free to play around with the sugar and such. Do not
ever panic though, sit back, relax, have a homebrew!
