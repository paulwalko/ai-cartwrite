The following ritual is guaranteed to work 100% of the time
25% of the time. This method was tried by Daniel “Rápunzel”
Bishop, Tommy “Socrates” Polson, Alex “Drop Kick” Booker,
and Amy “Driiiiiift" Skowronski on the 2/23/2013 Bone Nor-
man Rescue.
7:00 pm - 8:30 pm
VPI meeting, belligerently yell “Dance Party" through-
out. Being at least 3 beers in by this point is essential.
8:30 pm - 2 am
Dance party. Playing “Hanukah Matata”, “Flash”, and “Sweet Caroline” is highly recom-
mended. A study on the necessity of crushed pork rinds in your carpet is pending. At
least two party goers must make it to second base or greater.
2 am - 8 am
This region is theoretically spent by watching
ponies and sleeping, but nobody actually knows
went on.
8 am – 11:30 am
Vacuum up any pork rinds in the carpet, clean
all the sticky orange stuff in the bathroom, open
all the doors and windows to "let the stank out.”
Put the furniture back in position. Eating a 50/50
eggs to hot sauce ratio breakfast is recommend-
ed.
11:30 am – 12:00 pm
Receive email and volunteer. Feeling a little bit
too excited about an excuse to not do school
work is common.
