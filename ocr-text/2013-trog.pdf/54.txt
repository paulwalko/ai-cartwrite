People try to sell you stuff the entire time you are there. Mostly it's the exact same stuff you can find in
the shops around the site, just a bit more expensive. Rob, Alex, and I had lunch in a nearby restaurant
that was really large a cave entrance with some tables and a stage. The cactus and mushroom soup
was surprisingly good. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to push any leads to see if the cave actually
goes or not. The picture below was taken by Alex on top of the Pyramid of the Moon.
Once we left the pyramids, we drove directly to Real de Catorce. It took us about 10 hours to get
there, but it was also a destination worth the drive. Real de Catorce is considered a tourist destination,
and some of the hotels and restaurants were run by Europeans. The somewhat Americanized food was
a welcome change. There were street vendors and shops to explore, and the group took horses up the
mountain to see the abandoned silver mining town. The ride was pleasant, but the narrow mountain
trails were precarious at times. We were allowed to explore the old mines a bit, and I was surprised by
how in tact some of the buildings were.
We got home safely. The drive took 40 hours, including stops. Thanks for reading!
