Mexico Take Two (12/25/12)
It's that time of year again! In a few days, several Southwest Virginia cavers are loading up the
cars and heading down to Mexico. Deighan is leading the trip again this year, and other partici-
pants include Alex, Rob, Rebecca, Alice, JG, Katrina, and Andrew. I think a couple of Deighan's
friends are planning on meeting us at the border as well. While in Mexico, we are planning on re-
pelling several pits including Rio Choy (~210ft), Cepillo (-400ft?), Huahuas (~700ft), Borbollon
(-700ft), and Golandrinas (-1200ft), and we will also visit some places unrelated to caving such as
the pyramids near Mexico City and the Cascadas de Tamul (a really big waterfall for those of you
who don't speak Spanish). Stories to come once the action starts! Happy Holidays!
First Few Days (12/31/12)
It was a long drive, but it went fairly well all
things considered. We did have a slight
change of who actually came. Rebecca
dropped and David joined, putting our num-
ber to 11 with Bob and Frank. We stopped in
New Orleans for a late dinner, and Bourbon
Street was a lot of fun. We had a bit of trou-
ble at the border when the border patrol en-
tered a wrong number on one of the vehicle
permits, and the error wasn't noticed until the
first police checkpoint. Some of the group
was forced to turn back to fix the permit,
while others went ahead to get hotel rooms in
Cuidad Victoria. The group that turned back
got to the hotel fairly late, so we took today
to relax and slowly get to our next destina-
tion. This will alter our itinerary somewhat,
but I don't think we'll have to miss any of the pits. Other than that, nothing too eventful has hap-
pened so far. The real action should start tomorrow.
