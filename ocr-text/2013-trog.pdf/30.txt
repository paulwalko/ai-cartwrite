CAVE RESCUE PLANNING AND TRAINING UPDATE
By Blacksburg Man
As anyone who's been around the club for a while
knows, cave rescues are a fact of life. In my twenty plus
(gulp) years with the club, we've been involved in all
sorts of operations that fall under the general heading of
cave rescue - searching for lost spelunkers, freeing stuck
cavers, extricating the sick or injured, and sometimes,
unfortunately, body recoveries. Cave rescue events don't
happen in any regular or predictable manner, making it
all the more important that our grotto makes a concert-
ed effort to maintain preparedness for when these
events do occur.
Cave exploration is unique in many ways among outdoor
activities. For one thing, it's the only outdoor recreation activity that I know of that takes place dominantly on pri-
vate land, at least in our region. We rely on the goodwill of landowners in order to visit the majority of “our” caves.
Another big difference between caving and most other adventure pursuits is that when things go wrong, you can't
just dial 911 and have an ambulance or helicopter show up a half mile underground to haul the sick or injured to the
hospital. No, finding lost cavers and getting sick or injured cavers out of caves falls squarely on the shoulders of cav-
ers themselves, and in our area that means dominantly on cavers from VPI. We were reminded of this fact in 2012
and again this year when reports of spelunkers lost in Bone Norman Cave resulted in mobilization of VPI cavers two
hours north to West Virginia's Greenbrier Valley to assist in
search and rescue operations. In both cases, the majority of
the manpower and strong cavers came from the VPI Cave Club.
Largely, this is a demographic effect. As the caving population
ages, VPI is one of the few grottoes with continuous recruit-
ment and training of young cavers. Because of this fact, the
club must emphasize cave rescue preparedness.
The VPI Cave Club took several steps in the fall of 2012 to be
better prepared for the inevitable rescues that lurk over the
horizon. The first was the consolidation and moving of the res-
cue gear cache, led by our only member with pseudoparamili
tary ranking, Captain Ed Fortney. Ed was ably assisted by
Spotty Dog Rapier, the eternally youthful Dr. Eric Stanley, John
"Matt" Mulheren, Naomi Orndorff, and Blacksburg Man. Mike
Newsome had generously allowed the Club to store the rescue
gear in the barn at the Bat Ranch for years. Thanks, Mike! De-
