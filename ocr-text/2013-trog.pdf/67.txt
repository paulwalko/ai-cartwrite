After Cave Rave
This treat is perfect after a good cave day. I made this at Filthy Young Woman for pie day
and it was pretty delicious. Not to mention it's extremely easy to make, so those who are
inebriated will be able to â€œfollow" directions. It's chocolate so it looks like clay, and if you
have motivation you can draw bats with the chocolate on top!
Ingredients:
1 package of pudding & pie filling chocolate (5.85 OZ)
1 34 cups of milk
1 tub of whipped topping (8 OZ)
2-4 candy bars (tried Heath and Kit Kat, both good)
1 cube of cooking chocolate (sweet)
1 chocolate piecrust
Directions:
Mix the pie filling with the milk and half of the tub of whipped topping. Also smash up the candy bars in someway
(banging it with a beer bottle works) and then add half of the mashed candy bar to the pie filling mixture. Then pour
the mixture into the piecrust and top with the remaining tub of whipped topping and the rest of the candy bar. Melt the
cube of cooking chocolate in a microwave, or if the microwave suddenly stops working (I swear it wasn't my fault) use
the stovetop. Then dribble the chocolate on top in designs or splotches. Then pop it in the freezer until you get the
munchies.
Later you must order everyone to eat your pie. YOU MUST EAT THE PIE. You must be extremely annoying about it
so that all the pie is eaten. Also you should enjoy it, because hey you made some after cave rave dude.
You know what we should do right now. We should eat some pie.
