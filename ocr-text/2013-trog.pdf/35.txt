35
12:00 pm - 2:30 pm
Do vertical work and watch car
toons: fucking around in this
time period is essential.
2:30 pm – 3:30 pm
Gather gear, meet at sign out,
be mildly bewildered, pretend
to be worried about the lost
cavers rather than happy about
a cave trip.
3:30 pm – 4:00 pm
Gather supplies such as cliff bars, gas, sleeping bags... also a keg.
4:00 pm - 6:00 pm
Drive to the cave. Every turn made must be accompanied by shouting “Driüiiiiiift.” Seri-
ously try to hide how happy you are to go rescue people from Bone Norman.... but hav-
ing failed that start planning rescue pranks. Running around with Batman masks shout-
ing "Where are they!?" probably wouldn't go
over well, but whatever.
6:00 pm - 7:00 pm
Arrive at rescue, get oriented. Unload car.
7:00 pm - 7:30 pm
Find out that they're out. Reload car
7:30 pm - 8:00 pm
Decide to go in anyway. Unload car.
8:00 pm - 10:00 pm
Help break down- also find an excuse to go
cave for an hour. Reload car.
10:00 pm - 2:00 am
Go to a bar, drive home, drink the keg.
