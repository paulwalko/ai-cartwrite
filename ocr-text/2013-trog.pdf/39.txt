After posting this survey I received a bunch of
complaints about how bad the survey was and
how stupid I am. So I posted a new survey with
this question:
Why is everything Terrible?
You chose the wrong Picnic date
Obama
Everything is always terrible
John Mulheren
Because picnic isn't in Albuquerque
the negativity of this survey
No matter what you do , someone will hate it.
Never volunteer.
It's the Old Fart perspective
waa waa waaa I'm Old.
Because I'm so fucking old I should be
able to get my way...
Because people leave trash @ Picnic.
I'm sick and I'm out of mint schnapps.
Also, Obama.
I'm 200 miles away from you. </3
People who think that everyone is
ruled by a computer and immedi-
ately read all messages. I check
email about once a week, along
with my PO box.
Haha I love you you fucking dick. Re-
gards from NZ :)
Someone also found a way to post random
things like â€œImmanentize the eschaton,
brah." over 900 times. Thanks for your
responses!
