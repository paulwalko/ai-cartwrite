A ross Section of Caving in New Zealand

Well since I'm here I figured I had better do a Trog article about it. Also, Courtney said I should, in the annual
quest to fill out our newsletter.
Since coming to New Zealand I have noticed many similarities between our organizations. The NSS and NZSS (New
Zealand Speleological Society). They have a national newsletter, for instance, called the Tomo Times. Tomo being
a Maori word for a surface shaft/pit. They wear cave suits and helmets and have lights and tell off color jokes like
us but from there they start to differ quite significantly.
One major difference in New Zealand is that their caves range from about 35 degrees Fahrenheit in the alpine
caves to about 70 degrees Farenheit around Paturau. Those two places are within 70 linear miles of each other.
That makes planning for a cave trip a bit trickier. When at Paturau I found myself doing nasty duck unders and
stream crawls just to cool off a bit. Up on Mt. Owen in the Bulmer system staying dry can be a very important
safety factor.
Another notable difference is the way they go about getting to caves. Where we will often go caving as a day trip,
caving in the South Island of New Zealand almost always requires an overnight stay. Going to the alpine caves can
require a grueling tramp up a large mountain with a bunch of camping gear along with caving gear. As a result,
heli-caving is common when there is a lot of rope to be carried into a remote area. The helicopter will drop off the
gear while the cavers walk in.
Three large alpine caves have
in-cave camps when the com-
muting time to the limit of
exploration is too long to al-
low any effective exploration
The only exception is the old
camp left in Nettlebed that is
now used for a sporty through
-trip. These camps are
equipped with communal
sleeping bags to so that cave
pack can be filled up with food
and rope instead; a sleeping
bag liner is a good idea.
