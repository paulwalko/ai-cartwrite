HOLIDY PARADE
HOLIDY PARADE
Come
Thank you Captain Ed for suggesting that the
VPI Cave Club participate in the annual Blacks-
burg Holiday parade. While we had a small turn-
out of cavers, those of us who did attend had a
great night. Somehow we ended up behind a
group of equally odd people affiliated with
Strange Coffee Company. The group had an
amazing float with lights and a fog machine but
no one to ride on it. Fortunately for them, we
filled the float with cavers and tubas. They pro-
vided us with capes, wigs, and Luchador masks.
We rode a round proudly with the tubas blast-
ing Christmas medleys and the owner of the
coffee company running along side in a chicken
suit. I think we were the most popular float,
let's do it again next year!
