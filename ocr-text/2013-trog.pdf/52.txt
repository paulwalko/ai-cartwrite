Today it's still raining and Deighan's car is still in the shop. We're still a bit unsure of what we're go-
ing to do today. Adios!
The Past Several Days (1/8/13)
It's been a while since I last posted
and quite a bit has happened, but I'll
try to keep it fairly short. We
dropped Cepillo, Huahuas, and
Golondrinas. Most of the group did
Cepillo and Huahuas, but only six of
us did Golondrinas. The rest were
either too inexperienced (myself in-
cluded) or too tired to complete
three big climbs in three days. It was
either rainy or foggy from the 1st until the 7th, so being underground, or at least at the bottom of a
pit, was a welcome change. We were also planning on dropping Borbollon, but several members of
the group got sick and the rest of us didn't feel like dragging a 900ft rope through the tight pinches
before the pit. We entertained ourselves at the ranch by exploring the horizontal caves in the area.
For those of you who haven't seen the caves I've referenced, I'll give a brief description of each one:
Cepillo -- Cepillo is a 400ft
drop with some really fantas-
tic formations at the bot-
tom. The entrance is fairly
small, but the cave bells out
and the floor of the pit is
wide. The rig point is a tree
close to the lip, so it was really
just a matter of gently swing-
ing over the edge to get verti-
cal. The bottom consists of a
pool, some really cool popcorn
-like formations, and massive
pieces of sparkly flowstone.
