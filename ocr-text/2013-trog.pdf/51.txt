Las Pozas and Zulema's (1/2/13)
Deighan had some car trouble yesterday, so
we took yesterday to just explore the area
around Xilitla. The group went up to Las
Pozas, a tourist attraction full of strange ar-
chitecture built by Edward James sometime
around the 1970s. The site is full of spiral
staircases, some not leading anywhere, and
buildings with open walls, columns, and
arches. Apparently some of the buildings
were designed for human habitation, while
others were built to house zoo animals. A stream runs through the site with several waterfalls, and
the outdoor footpaths between the buildings are closely surrounded by the Mexican jungle. Some of
the stairs and pathways are narrow and high off the ground, and of course there are no hand-
rails. Something like Los Pozas would never be legal in the United States. After visiting Las Pozas,
Alex and I split off from the group for a bit to get some food. We visited a restaurant we went to last
year that has some really fantastic pina coladas and tostadas con pollo. Next time you make a pina
colada, try putting some cinnamon in it.
Around dinner time, we met Zulema in Xilitla and drove up to her house in the mountains. She pre-
pared a wonderful meal of chicken salad and guacamole, and she made homemade fruit punch
which contained a mixture of sugar cane, grapes, pineapple, and other fruits that I could not identi-
fy. It started raining soon after we got there, and the power went on and off several times. We had
a good time swapping caving stories with
Frank, Bob, and Jared, who we met in
Huichihuayan, around a fire while Zu-
lema's son roasted us marshmellows. Zu-
lema was kind enough to offer us a room
in her house so we wouldn't have to
camp in the rain. When we woke up, she
made a breakfast of huevos, jambon,
chorizo, avocado, cueso fresca, tortillas,
freshly squeezed orange juice, and cof-
fee. Needless to say, we were well taken
care of.
