You get back to the first room where everyone split off and see the rock climber shivering and
clutching his bent wrist. He tells you that he's freezing and would really like to get out of here. You call
out down the other passages for the girl and other freshman guy. The guy comes back from his passage
and you ask him to take off his sweatshirt to give to the rock climber. He says he's kind of cold too and
would rather not give it up but you insist, saying that clearly the rock climber needs it more. Then he tells
you that there is some cool stuff down his passage too. So you go with him and leave the rock climber,
wondering what ever happened to the girl. Like the other passage this one is pretty tight, but it also has
some tricky climbs. You get to a canyon section and show the guy how to go through. He struggles and
starts slipping into the canyon, his shoes getting wedged further down where the canyon narrows.
You tell him to pull himself out but he starts to panic and loses hope. Without help you won't be able to
pull him out so you go back to the entrance room to find the rock climber. When you get there you find
it empty and figure the rock climber probably left. You call out for the girl or the frat boy but don't hear
any responses. Frustrated with their inadequate caving abilities, you check your watch. It's 3:15. You're
cursing and decide to head out, not wanting to owe a keg.
By the time you get back to the car it's 3:30 and you're not sure if you can't make it back by 4:00.
You think to call sign out but you don't actually have anyone's phone number. So you speed down 460
praying that no cops
are out. Somehow
you make it back
without a ticket and
when you get to sign
out it's 3:50. You
sign back in and
erase the trainees'
names, because after
all you knew to have
them write in pencil.
Relieved to be back
you go home to
shower and nap be-
fore the party. All in
all, not a bad day.
Just leave the trainee there, I'm sure he'll find his way out eventually.
