How (Not) to Lead a Cave Trip
Courtney Trost
So you just got your membership, congratulations! You know everything there is to know in order to
lead your first cave trip. Well sort of. So you announce at the meeting that you will be leading a trip on Sat-
urday at 10am to “somewhere easy” and you welcome any newbies. Three eager freshman come up saying
that they have never been caving before, although one brags about being a rock climber. A sophomore
who's been around a few times asks to join too. So you tell them what to bring and where to meet the next
morning.
Saturday morning rolls around and you're rushing to throw all of your cave gear in the trunk of your
car, not sure if you're still a little drunk or just hung-over. You don't think you have everything, but who
cares you're just going to Tawneys anyway. So you show up behind Smyth and surprisingly all four of the
trainees are waiting. You head over to sign out and struggle to find enough working lights since there is al-
ready a twelve person James trip out. You give the rock climber one that only works on the red setting and
tell him it's fine the trip will be short anyway. One of the freshman says she brought a flashlight and you tell
her to use that. Regretting making this trip in the first place, you stare at the sign out sheet trying to figure out
what your sign in time should be. You still feel pretty crappy from the night before and you know there's a
bat ranch party tonight that you obviously don't want to miss. So you write 4pm thinking if you aren't back
by then you better have a rescue in order to get a nap in before the party. And this trip is only going to be
two hours right?
Everyone gets back in the car
eager to get into a cave. They start asking
you about the cave and the sophomore
complains that he's already been to Taw-
neys and it's pretty lame. Instead he sug-
gests that you all go check out this cave
he some of his frat brothers found while
hiking around some woods by Mountain
Lake. Your response should probably
be something along the lines of, “You
know what, you're right that does sound
like more fun.” So you drive past the Bat
Ranch towards Mountain Lake, curious
to see this mysterious cave.
Who wouldn't want to find a cave at Mountain Lake?
