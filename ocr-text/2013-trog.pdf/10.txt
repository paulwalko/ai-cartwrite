INTRODUCTION
Welcome to the Cave Club, a group of misfits. We'll take you, beard or no beard, weird or.... Well just
weird. There aren't many groups out there that will welcome anyone with open arms to go under-
ground, camp in a cow field with 5+ kegs, or build the world's sketchiest float. But that's what we do
and we sure have a hell of a time doing it. Thank you to everyone in the club for always welcoming
newcomers by leading a cave trip or handing them a PBR. And thank you to all of the old farts who
just won't stop coming back for helping to make this club what it is. A lot of our events wouldn't hap-
pen without the persistence and dedication of those who have a better attention span than the col-
lege students. To every person who helped out with training, hosted a spelio, or donated a piece of
burniture, this club is awesome because of you. Let's keep the traditions going and the weirdness
alive.
