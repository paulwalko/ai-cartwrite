The night moved on with the more traditional awards;
Club Secretary Nick Socky and Daniel Bishop were inducted into the hallowed
realm of the Drinking Techniques Committee with their performances at last
year's Filthy Young Women gathering.
Aaron Thomas was given the Flame Out Award for his antics after the More
Wine Party at OTR. Crime scene photos were obtained that were not for the
squeamish.
Safe Driver Awards were given to Tommy Polson for doing acrobatics in Mike
Newsome's car and Naomi Orndorff for another attempt at taking the road less
travelled. At this point she has to be doing it for the attention.
BrainBucket was given to Katherine Ferguson for her single handed accident in
Bane's Spring. No, Katherine, we aren't making fun of you. And yes, you are
Beautiful.
Courtney Trost awarded Trainee of the Year to Sarah Crowder. Unfortunately,
Sarah couldn't make it.
Mike Newsome was given Honorary Mem-
bership in the Club for his many contribu-
tions to the Caving Community. Thank you,
Mike.
The A.1. Cartwright Honorarium was be-
stowed upon Scott Rapier for his many years
of service and support to the V.P.I. Cave Club.
Thank you ,Scott.
The next morning Joan Redder fed us
breakfast and let us recuperate at her house.
Joan, thank you so much for hosting us for so
many post Banquet get togethers. Let's do it
all again next year.
