LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT
Quite a bit has happened to our club in the past year. We've gained five new members
(congratulations guys and gals!) and we have a few dudes and dudettes who are almost there. We've
THEATE
worked a lot to prepare ourselves for
cob
cave rescues, and even got the
chance to help out at the real deal.

Our members have led tons and tons
of trips this year exposing literally
millions of newbies to caving. Also,
we've continued our tradition or in-
tercontinental caving. Our members
have gone underground in Mexico,
China, New Zealand (and probably
some others I forgot about). Hope-
fully our next president will be able
to ensure we scoop some booty in
Antarctica. I'd
settle
for Africa
though. I would like thank everyone
| who has helped make our club what
it is: a troupe of borderline insane nogoodniks who thirst for underground treasure. Finally I would like
to conclude with a zip zop zupity doo. Hey Courtney, no one reads this part right? Right?
-John
