Cavers in New Zealand also tend to
function more as a national body.
Where we say we are VPI cavers; the
Kiwis will often say they are NZSS (New
Zealand Speleological Society) cavers
associated with the various clubs
(Canterbury Caving Group, Nelson Spe-
leological Group, Auckland Speleological
Group, etc.). Cave trip are often run as
NZSS trips so that there can members of
three different clubs or more. Active NZ
cavers are thin on the ground with NZSS
having about the same number of active
members as VPI.
The last difference I would like to note is the lack of university clubs in New Zealand. The reason for this is lack of
caves in the areas where major universities are located. Every now and then a university club will pop up for about
five years but they are not very sustainable. The lack of university clubs provides a more laid back environment in
which raucous parties are rare.
I believe there is plenty to be learned from the Kiwis in the way of caving that would be applicable for VPI. Kiwis
have based their cave Search and Rescue methods on US practices with early courses supplied by US Ropes That
Rescue. I do not plan to close the gate l've opened (a sin punishable by death I'm aware) and I hope some kiwis
find their way to our little mountain enclave so that we can trade insults, anecdotes, and caving experiences.
