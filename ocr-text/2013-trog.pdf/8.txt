LETTER FROM THE EDITOR
Thanks to everyone who sent me an article this year!! We've had a pretty eventful year with five new
members and a lot of new trainees. Our events have of course been memorable with everything from
lube wrestling at Halloween to finding
out our relationships based on our
Mayan calendar birthdays at TAG to
some seriously good BBQ and dancing
at Banquet. It's been a busy year for
rescues with a full blown practice res-
cue and another real one at Bone Nor-
man (seriously is this going to be an
annual thing?). I'm
happy that this
Trog documents all of these events for
us to look back on in years to come. I
was really happy to not have to badg-
er people too much to get articles this
year and I'm pleased that a lot came
from aspiring members. I love having
the perspective of a trainee on one of
their first trips because some of us have forgotten what that experience is like. This year's Trog is espe-
cially diverse with international perspectives from both Mexico and New Zealand. It's cool to see how far
we can spread our VPI caving experience across the globe. Cave on and write more articles!
