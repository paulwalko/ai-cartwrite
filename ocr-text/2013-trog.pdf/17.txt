Environmental concerns did of course surface with the discovery of this new technological surveying tech-
nique. FEMA, CDC, and WHO all said that such a device was too dangerous for people to use and would
have horrible effects on the physical and biological environment. Fears of waters source and ground water
contamination were also a strong concern. Cave nuclear researchers claim the amounts of radiation created
from the device were only slightly higher than the average exposure during a flight to Beijing from Los An-
geles. Cave biologist Wil “Wolfgang” Orndorff also stated:
“The only creatures in the cave biome of any concern were the bats, but because of White Nose Syn-
drome, most of the bats are now dead. And on top of that, any radiation affects to the bats would most likely
result in a new species resistant to white nose syndrome. Also, a salamander with two tails would just be too
cool not to have.”
The most recent research from cave biologists shows that the small amounts of radiation created by
the Gamma Probe could actually kill the Geomyces destructans fungus associated with the white nose syn-
drome in the localized location where it is used.
Currently, the device is in use and is being closely monitored for any negative effects, and more re-
search is still being done. Its most recent use was at the VPI-Cave-Club-sponsored survey event called
Filthy Young Women (Rebecca Sewered, Amy Scrotomnski, Samantha Huff-n-puff, Sarah Iler, Sara Fleet-
wood, Hillary Shitmeister). Because of the possible dangers of the device, when used in survey, cavers were
required to wear lead-plated cups to protect reproductive organs.
