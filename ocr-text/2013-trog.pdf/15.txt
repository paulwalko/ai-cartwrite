Technology Advances Cave Survey
By Nick “Peppy” Socky
Detailed cave surveying, involved with project caving, has been around for about 40 to 50 years
now. Typical techniques still include using a measuring tape, compass, and clinometer. When readings are
taken from each of these tools, the sketcher writes down the data and hand draws a line-plot and a rough
sketch of cave cross-section at each specific station. Other techniques involve using high-tech sonar devices
to create 3-D cross-sectional representation of the passage. Using this surveying device is a great improve-
ment from the simple instruments and sketching, but such systems are also expensive. Most recently, exten-
sive research and great advances in science have resulted in an even more sophisticated device to help with
cave surveying and exploration.
The device, called a Gamma Probe, is the most advanced cave exploration instrument ever created.
In early 2013, North Korea performed yet another underground nuclear weapons test. Measurements of the
explosion again registered on local Richter scales on the Korean peninsula. Cave researchers had permission
from South Korea to place new probe devices to see if radiation from the nuclear explosion could possibly
plot and find new cave passage underground. The theory is similar to x-ray devices used in hospitals.
