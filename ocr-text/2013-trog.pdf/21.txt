Sure enough the sophomore was right, after about 30 minutes of wonder-
ing around in the woods you find a small cave entrance. The down climb
in looks pretty tricky and you can't really see the bottom. The rock climber
looks at it and claims he's seen much worse, so of course you offer to let
him go first. You'd like to give him a belay but of course in the rush of the
morning you didn't pack your webbing. So he heads down with his red
light and acts quickly and carelessly trying to prove how easy it is. He slips
and screams and you hear a loud crash and crack as he hits the bottom.
You asks if he's okay and he starts complaining about his wrist. You go in
after him, acting much more cautiously and make the down climb safely.
Once you get down you look at his wrist which is bent backwards with a
bone poking through the side. Your response should probably be something like, “It's only a flesh wound.
You'll be fine.” So the other three trainees head down after you, acting just as cautiously and making it safely
as well.
Once everyone is down you start to explore the cave. There are so many different passages you can't
decide which way to go so you send one person in each direction figuring that way you'll surely find the best
one. You hear another scream, this time from the freshman girl. You call out asking if she's okay but there's
no response. Figuring it must have been a scream of joy and that she found an awesome passage, you head
back to look for her. You're not really sure which way she went but you run into the sophomore frat boy
and he tells you that his way goes on
forever. So you go with him and let
the other three explore on their own
some more.
The passage does go on for quite a
ways but it seems to get tighter and
tighter. Soon you're both crawling
through a squeeze that your helmets
don't fit through. The sophomore
asks if he can take his off and keep
going. You say sure but that you'd like
to go check on the others. So you
head back and tell him to yell if he
finds anything cool.
If the trainee wants to keep going, let them keep going!
