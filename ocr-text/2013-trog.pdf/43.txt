This year's band fit the TAG mood perfectly, a bluegrass band, rather than one of those Creed
tribute ones from previous years. We all drank and danced around the stage for hours. Once the music
died down we headed back to the campsite to continue singing obnoxiously, trying to keep awake any-
one around us. I think this went on until about 4am with John on guitar and the rest of us drunkenly try-
ing to come up with new songs. We were especially happy with our night when we heard the rumor
about someone shitting in the hot tub. Seriously who does that? Overall a successful TAG.
