there it was! As I come out, exhilarated about how beautiful the view was, I realize what's going on
and took caution in not telling the other trainee about how beautiful it was. The best part of the trip,
just a little VPI cave club secret.
I thought the library past cavers set up down in the cave was pretty amusing. It almost look
like a scene from “Between Two Ferns” cause there were a couple of potted plants around the drums
of “literature.” I couldn't help but wonder, how the hell did all this get down here? I couldn't imag-
ine going through the trouble of taking down a couple of potted plants and caving with them. Well
I still don't know but I guess it's just some of the shenanigans cavers around here partake in. What's
not to like? Peace, quiet and some quality “literature.” in a cave nonetheless.
The most memorable part of the trip for me was the climbs up. The first substantial climb,
was my first time climbing on knots. I didn't mind the amount of energy that needed to be exerted
to get up the drop. It was more about getting over the fact that, the only thing keeping me alive as I
dangle 100 feet in the air are these three helical bowline knots. Inside I was sort of freaking out but I
think I did pretty well keeping my cool on the outside. It was pretty assuring though that everyone I
asked (which was all the members of the club that went on the trip) said that the worst that could
happen is a heel hang. After making that first 100+ foot climb, my nerves were pretty settled. The
next climb, I was a lot more relaxed. I thought about how many cavers before me had made it
through climbing on knots without having something catastrophic happening.
In my very young caving career,
this trip was definitely my favorite so far. I
can't wait to get these requirements done
and be a member and lead some of my
own trips. A big thanks to John Mulheren,
Courtney Trost, Brian (I don't know you're
last name), and another alumni member
whose name I've forgotten (my apologies,
I'm pretty bad with names).
