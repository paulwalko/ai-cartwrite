October 4th to 7th we celebrated the 35th annual TAG Fall
AM
TAG
Cave-In! On Friday a group spent the day rappelling a cliff side in Ala-
bama while others drove down from Blacksburg, and some started
the party mid afternoon. Friday night we lit the smaller fire, shaped as
a train this year. Everyone gathered around the stage for karaoke
XOR
after.
35th Annual TAG Fall Cave-in
Saturday
started with the annual Monkey Butt Relief 5k at
8:00am. VPI continues to keep the award for the
fastest female runner, thanks to Sarah Crowder
this year. However as John said, “You aren't com-
peting against the other runners, you're com-
peting against the hangover. If you finish the race
you won.” Personally I was impressed with myself
for dragging my butt out of bed to run. I think
others were impressed they got out of bed to watch. To each their own.
After the run a group of us headed out to do Valhalla. During TAG this cave is visited frequently
so groups sign up for time slots. We showed up well after our
time slot had started and were pretty annoyed to find the group
before us still at the pit with eight people down and none at the
top. We ended up rigging our own rope on the other side of the
pit, although it wasn't the ideal rigging position. Having never
been to Valhalla, I was highly impressed with the view both
from the top and bottom. It reminded me of Pighole on ster-
oids. Despite the setback, we got everyone down and up who
wanted to and headed back for the Saturday night fire. I hope
that no matter how many times I go to TAG the fire will never
stop amazing me. I wonder sometimes if people driving by think
it's a forest fire. One of the best drunk games we can play is
who can get the closest to the Saturday night fire.
