Huahuas -- Huahuas is a 700ft drop on one side of
the pit, and about a 500ft drop on the other
side. The high side has a difficult, undercut lip, but
once you are vertical the view is fantastic. The bot-
tom is covered in moss and plants, and erosion creates
a marbled pattern in the soil when seen on rope. We
rigged the drop on both sides so we were able to re-
pel the high side and climb the short side. Before an-
yone comments, no, there weren't any injuries and
yes, I repelled from the high side. Just quite a bit
slower this time.

Golondrinas -- Golondrinas is a 1200ft pit. I didn't do
it, but the pictures looked cool.
I'm still waiting on pictures. Rob and I are planning
on doing that tomorrow.
The Pyramids and Real de Catorce (1/14/13)
TORTAS
The last few days were devoted to tourist destinations including the pyramids of Teotihuacan and Real
de Catorce. It took us a bit longer to get to the pyramids than we had hoped, but the trip south was
definitely worth it. The pyramids are enormous and very impressive. Several of the are decorated with
intricate carvings representing
the different gods. The largest

Micsendes
pyramid is called the Pyramid
of the Sun and is thought to
have been a monument to the
god of the Sun. However, re-
cent findings suggest the pyra-
mid may have been intended
for the god of water. The Pyra-
mid of the Moon is smaller, but
still beautiful. Tourists are al-
lowed to climb to the tops of the
pyramids on steep stone steps,
and the view is magnificent.
