PICNIC
Another year, another great pic-
nic. We were fortunate to have
good weather despite a crappy
forecast; only really getting rain
during our traditional trip to
Dairy Queen, and at night after
everyone was too drunk to care.
No blue punch this year, but
plenty of kegs. From what I
heard we actually finished
(or at least almost finished)
all of them this year. Kudos
to the genius who moved
the keg next to the fire Sat-
urday night. We would hate
to have to walk the whole
20 yards to refill our beers. I
think this move seriously
contributed to the amount
of beer drank.
