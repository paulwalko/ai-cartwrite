Two New Ways to Use a Fire Hose
By Andrew Van Horn
Upon entering "Golf Course 2” on the Monday of Filthy Young Women 2013, we plunged into a narrow cave
passage mostly filled with cold water. Once the water reached our chests, the group of cavers that had planned to sur-
vey the cave instantly began to reconsider. As we looked back to the mouth of the cave, Phillip Balister was reprimand-
ing us to toughen up and survey the watery passage. After a reply of“no, you f***king do it,” the group seemed to have
reached an impasse as I stood with water up to my waist, wondering if day one of Filthy Young Women was already
over.
Then, Peppy scrambled down the rocks, seized the measuring tape, and said: "On station!” I waded to a stalac-
tite a few meters away, and the surveying began. I ran lead tape, Peppy took care of the instruments job, and Sara Fleet-
wood followed along, mapping the cold and claustrophobic cave. Quickly, we discovered that several stations would
require standing in cold water almost up to our necks, while some would necessitate kneeling in shallow water, when
the cave's roof descended and forced us into a crouched position.
The wading was fun, though, as it was in a cave prone to flooding, which was littered with driftwood and other
debris below the surface of the water, which was eager to tangle our boots and snag our cave suits. After getting a series
of very long survey shots, we rounded a corner, only to hear behind us what sounded like the entirety of the VPI Cave
Club sloshing down the passage towards us. As we would later discover, it was Matt Skowronski making two heroic
tries to avoid developing a fear of the water. Once, he even brought Calvin with him; however, we never actually saw
them. The auditory effects were that good-we could hear
them speaking at the mouth of the cave even hundreds of
feet away even when we were far out of sight.
At last, after the water receded to being only a foot
deep, I came to the end of the tunnel we were in. The tunnel
went ninety degrees to the right with something in the wa-
ter. I knelt and quickly discovered that deep in the cave,
among the debris, there was an old, partially disintegrated
fire hose. Beyond that, the passage split into two directions,
both ending in a high, wide, water-filled room.
"Is it deep?" Peppy said.
"I'm not sure. Let's measure it,” I replied.
We then dislodged one end of the oddly serpentine
fire hose and dragged it down the twisting and cramped mud
-free passage. We leaned our heads out of the hole in the wall
and peered down at the watery pit below.
“Don't fall in,” admonished Peppy. This was useful
advice to an unexperienced trainee such as myself.
