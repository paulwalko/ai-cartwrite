After we hiked out of Rio Choy, we drove to Huichihuayan (Wi-chi-y-in) for the annual New Year's
Eve celebration. We began the night with a trip to the usual taco stand and had wonderful beef,
lamb, and pork tacos for five pesos apiece ($1.00 = 12.5 pesos after exchange fees). After we went
back to the hotel to shower, we went to the town square for the celebration. The New Year's Eve
party in Huichihuayan comes complete with a dancing transvestite and a coffin filled with fireworks
with the old year painted on it. Every hour up until midnight, the coffin and a live band are paraded
around the town until all the townspeople are in the square. The transvestite dances with the village
men, and many couples dance to the live music. Food is sold by vendors in the square, and it's gener-
ally just a good time. At midnight, the coffin is lit on fire, and the fireworks within eventually ex-
plode. The music
and dancing con-
tinues through the
night, but most of
our group was ex-
hausted from Rio
Choy and went to
bed soon after mid-
night.
So far, I've been
posting these entries
in internet cafes,
and I don't want to
bring in everyone's
electronics to add
pictures. I'll add
pictures of everything you've read about next time we're in a hotel.
As a side note, if you have access to our itinerary, know that it now very inaccurate. The confusion
with the border crossing delayed us by a day, and we are considering changing the order of the drops
in light of the recent restriction on Golandrinas. Whether or not we will be allowed to drop Go-
landrinas at all is still up in the air, but we will if we can. For those of you who are depending on in-
ternet access to keep in touch with someone on the trip, don't worry too much if you don't hear from
us when you expected to. That's all for now. Happy New Year!!
