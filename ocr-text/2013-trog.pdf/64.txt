Some New Zealand inspired fun facts about glow worms â€“ Ellen Koertge
They are not actually worms.
In the northern hemisphere they are
beetles (lightening bugs)
They are a fungus gnat's larvae in New
Zealand and Australia
The species in New Zealand is Arach-
nocampa luminosa
Can be found in caves, old tunnels, and
the forest. (anywhere that is damp,
humid, and with little to no wind)
They eat a variety of flying insects, some even eat spiders and millipedes
They light of the glow worm is to attract prey so they get caught in the sticky thread
The glow worm pulls up the thread with its mouth to get their catch
Adult glow worm flies are able to pull free of the threads if they accidently touch one
The light is produced by an organ similar to our kidney. All insects have this organ, but
only the glow worm can produce light with it.
This organ has its own air sac because so much oxygen is needed to produce the light
Fungus gnat eggs are the only stage that does not produce the light
If the worm gets startled it hides the light because it takes a few minutes to actually
shut it off
A single glow worm makes 15-25 sticky lines
a night
It takes about 15 minutes to make one line
Large glow worms can have up to 70 lines
As many as 40% of glow worms in caves are
killed by a white fungus
Traveling around New Zealand Joker and I saw
many advertisements for glow worm cave
tours. These caves have become large tourist
attractions. Instead of paying for one of these
attractions Instead of having for one of those http://www.wildwanderer.com/blog/?p=102
tours we did this really cool hike to an old tunnel that was use to bring water to the
other side of the mountain for power. In that tunnel there were glow worms all over,
and seeing the small green lights all over the wall was an awesome sight.
