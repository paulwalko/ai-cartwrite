I replied: “Right. Lowering in the hose.” I pulled the heavy metal nozzle of the hose to over the water, and began
to lower it. “One, two, three..” I counted out the feet as hose disappeared into the murky water. “Eleven, twelve, thir-
teen..." at last we ran out of the piece of hose that we had, still without having touched the bottom of the silt-laden,
opaque, foul-smelling water below. We let it go and gave up on surveying much more.
“Alright, I'm gonna swim it,” Peppy decided. In the meantime, we took some more station points and finished the
survey of the cave, being as Sara the sketcher had caught up.
We dragged over the fire hose, and I wrapped it around my waist, as an adrenaline-fueled Peppy lowered himself
down the steep embankment with it into the frigid water below. He began taking the clipped gasps one would expect
such cold water to inspire. Once acclimated, he lurched forward into the dark water to find out what was at the other end
of the room we had reached. More passage? More of this same room? Bore hole? The other end of the cave? Peppy's short
strokes continued, as did Sara and my cheers for him to keep swimming. At last he rounded the corner, and his light land-
ed on-
Nothing. The cave ended in a nasty, dirty sump. Peppy splashed back, and I resumed my braced position as he
dragged himself out of the funky pit. He stood up, and instead of shivering or looking dazed from the shock, he smiled and
commented on how warm his dragon suit—a quasi-wetsuit baselayer—had kept him. After taking the last few measure-
ments, we left the unraveling fire hose turned climbing rope where it lay draped into the sump and left.
In hindsight, the cave was nothing tremendous. However, it was the second one I'd ever surveyed and it was a
good time. To a trainee as green as I am, the experience was a good one. I enjoyed going first as lead tape, and am thank-
ful that Peppy and Sara were so determined to go. It was a good first day.
