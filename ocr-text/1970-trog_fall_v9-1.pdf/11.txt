SOME NOTES ON CAVE-OWNER RELATIONS
The importance of good cave-owner relations can never be
over-emphasized, We all realize the basic practices of asking
permission and avoiding the obvious destruction of property
but how many people really conscientiously consider and prac-
tice the full spectrum of cave-owner diplomacy and property
respect? Some cavers do not realize the tactics and problems
involved in a screwed up relationship between the owner and
himself, while others seem to have a somewhat careless atti-
tude toward the owner's property due to either negligence or
just plain a pathy. The importance of these two areas should
be understood by all cavers in order to avoid the closing
of any cave or the bad opinion of any owner due to the actions
of one or two careless people,
In the first place, a man's land is solely and completely
his own, and he is under no obligation to allow anyone else
on his land. Moreover, man is still a territorial animal who
is very cautious about protecting his private domain from
"intruders". And, like it or not, you as a funky caver are
an intruder in the eyes of some land-owners, especially if
you differ in appearance or any other way from him, because
of man's basic difficulty in accepting anything alien or
strange. Although some owners are aware of various modes
of life, others have had very limited associations with the
"outside world" and may consequently be very opinionated
against the "rebellious" college student, due partly to the
image projected by the news media, or his own personal resent-
ment of an education, This type of person will tend to asso-
ciate characteristics such as personal appearance, dress, and
speech with his picture of the "campus rebel",
I would like to point out that I am not justifying nar-
row-mindedness, I am merely saying that it does occur and
that we occasionally must cope with it if we wish to be al-
lowed in certain caves. However, extreme cases of land-owner
resentment or contempt toward student cavers is rare, So I
am not suggesting that we don the appearance of a farmer to
bridge the social gap, but rather become aware of the cave-
owner's position, Try to dispel any barriers by friendly and
tactful conversation so that he will accept you on a personal
basis for just what you are - a caver.
The problem of cavers simply not thinking about all the
details of property respect can produce unwanted results and
should be an area of major concern... It is much easier to
climb over a fence rather than walk around to a gate; discard
your garbage rather than go to the trouble of takingi it: home;
and it's easier to drive over the cave-owner's fields rather
than park the car and walk all the way to the cave, You, as
a caver, may not consider these neglects very important, but
you may be very conscientous about removing writing or
spent carbide from the cave. The farmer, however, coulonitiie.?
