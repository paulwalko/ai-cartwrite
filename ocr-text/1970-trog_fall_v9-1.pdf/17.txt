FALL.
THE TECH TROGLOBYTE
AN
bottle of rum, We all went back to the campsite and as Loud,
Douty, and I began on the beer, Dale began to prepare the
spagetti dixner,
I have a little trouble remembering the rest, but this is
kind of how it went.
Before the spagetti was done we had finished a couple of
6-packs, and the rum, Janet and Mike left before dinner and
missed the best part of the party,
The spagetti was delicious. I couldn't believe how good
it tasted, and the soup and vienna sausage were equally tastey.
It was a tribute to Dale's cooking abilities and the condition
of our minds,
Then came the watermelon. We went to the back of the camp
room (later named the Fourth of July Room), split it into nine
pieces, and devoured it,
It was as ripe as we were. The situation was almost at a
peak when Dale broke out the bottle of Cold Duck,
I don't remember what it tasted like going down, but on
the return trip (accompanying spagetti, beer,and watermelon)
it tasted terrible, Dale was impressed by the volume of my
regurgitation and wanted a picture, so I took another drink
and did my thing. After recuperating for a few minutes, Douty
asked if I felt like going to the Canyon Room to light it up
with a flare Mike Kayes had left with us,
"Hell! Puking is part of drinking", I replied as we
headed toward the Canyon Room, We lit up the room, signed in
the register, sang a few bars of The Star Spangled Banner, went
back to the Fourth of July Room, and passed out,
The next morning, slightly hungover, we had breakfast and
headed out of the cave. It was a long hard drag, but uneventful.
We got out about 3:00 on Sunday, and sat in the sunshine drink-
ing the tw) ans of PBR J.oud and I had carried out, .
