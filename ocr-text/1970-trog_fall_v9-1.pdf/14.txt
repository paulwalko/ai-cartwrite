FALL
THE TECH TROGLODYTE ..
1970
After lunch we turned down the side of a side road and
hopped out. Looking for the back entrance to Windy Mouth Cave
took the rest of the afternoon, with no promising leads at all.
Since we didn't want to be late for the party, we quit looking
at 3:30 and went back to Moncove Lake, We arrived about 6:30
in time to watch Tom Vigour brew up his famous beebleberry
swill, Bleah.
Janet Pickens (now McCormick) said that 80 people had
registered! Linda Heitz and I allowed that if 80 people were
there, they must be asleep in the trees. Among the important
regional bigwigs present were Charlie Maus, Roger Baroody, Phil
Lucas, Bud Rutherford, Captain Karst, John Reich, Rick Banning,
Mike Houpt, Carol Hybner, Ken Free, the Mikesells, and R.E..
Whittemore. You know, there's a song going around about Cap-
tain Karst, Have y'all heard it? Easter Pig and I sang it to
the Captain Sunday morning to help him get over his hangover,
It goes like this:
"C-A-P-T-I-N K-A-R-S-T Captain Karst, Captain Karst,
forever let us hold your banner high (high, high) Who's the
leader of the band that's made for you and me? C-A-P-T-I-N
K-A-R-S-T." Isn't it cute? So catchy:
I really don't remember much about that party. Woodland
parties are weird. I remember looking for Phil Lucas who wasn't
anywhere to be found. And trying to help Linda declothe John
Powers so that he might sleep better inside his stuffy tent.
Then I said a tearful goodbye to Russ, Danny, and Lynn and
landed in my sleeping bag. All of a sudden the Great Speckled
Bird decided to drip a drop upon me, Quick as a wink, I cater-
pillared to the car (have you ever tried to walk in a sleeping
hag?) and spent the night on the floor board.
On Sunday Pig, Powers, Whitt, Hixson, and I'went off to
help Linda find a back entrance to Windy Mouth, Linda found
thru and yg maut, our separate ways, happy, but drunk,
Anne Whittemore
