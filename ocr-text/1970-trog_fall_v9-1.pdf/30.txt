All told, Drain Drop is 1200 feet long. As the map
attests, it is not complicated. So if you must visit the cave,
be sure you take enough weapons to defeat its numerous denizens
of the deep.

THE BORN LOSER #2
On April 25, 1970, a small band of three set forth at
12:30 pm for the sole purpose of exploring and mapping what
had recently been entitled the "North Subway Passages of
Newberry's Cave, (Bland Co., Va.) In our group were Pete
Schnaars, all around know-it-all, who made the trip possible,
Liz Leach, number one note-taker, and me, a "damn trainee" who
knew nothing, or maybe less, when the trip started. .
I was eager to get to the cave, since I had been promised
a chance to read the brunton, Pete and Liz, I suppose, were
shuddering at the thought of teaching me.
One-thirty found us outside the entrance having made the
discovery that Liz had left her gloves in the car. A short
stroll over the hill soon corrected this and we quickly chim-
neyed the entrance to find three orange and spotted salamanders
at the botton,
Some few minutes later we were at the Devil's Staircase,
All of us having been in the cave before made things move quickly
until we got to where we wanted to start mapping.
It took me quite a while to catch on to brunton reading.
It's a wonder Pete and Liz put up with me,
Finally it seemed that I caught on, Nevertheless, I was
still slow and we only mapped about half of what had been
previously explored. We discovered that what we had thought
to be about 500 feet was more like 1150 feet,
Due to coldness on the part of two of us, and a headache
on the part of the third party, a unanimous decision was
reached to abort the trip. We retreated to the vault room for
a vienna sausage snack and signed the register,
The trip out took a little longer than usual because some
of us, me for instance, wanted to try some climbs on the
Devil's Staircase a little differently. On one climb, I
leaped twelve feet into the air to reach the top! Would you
believe maybe I just stretched like hell to reach about three
handholds in the distance?
0.03.
