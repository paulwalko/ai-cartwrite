THE TECH TROGLODYTE
UNDER THE CARBIDE DUMP
Speaking of carbide dumps, spent carbide is one of the
disadvantages of carbide lamps,
Carbide lamps have long been the guiding light of the old
world, or eastern, cavers. Many argue of the superiority of
other light sources. While vertical techniques, mapping, tech-
niques, and even clothing have undergone many inprovements, the
carbide lamp remains relatively unchanged. Their continued use
and wide acceptance attest to their utility.
The carbide lamp has provided cavers with many thousands
of hours of dependable service. They have also provided cavers
with a continuing nuisance - spent carbide,
There are two basic choices in the disposal of spent car-
bide. 1) Leave it in the cave, or 2) carry it out, If care is
not taken when leaving it in the cave, spent carbide can result
in unsightly dumps, and as the speleo-ecologists point out, may
harm cave life, Yet to carry it out can be a nuisance and some-
times impractical. It is bulky since carbide doubles in volume
as it is used. Carbide which is still reacting is hot and can
cause a rather explosive situation, especially in a baby bottle
with a tight lid.
Most ecologists argue not that we should not pollute at adt,
but rather that our pollution should not be extreme enough to
effect the relations between living organisms and their environ-
ment. The conservationist objects, not about spent carbide in
a cave, but rather about being able to see it, The speleo-
ecologist objects not about spent carbide in a cave, but rather
about its effect on the cave environment. The efficient spele-
ologist objects not about the spent carbide, but about having to
carry in, and through the cave enough containers to carry out
twice the volume of carbide that he carries in. If he uses
baby bottles to carry out the spent carbide, it would be
necessary to carry in two bottles to handle one bottle of
carbide. If plastic bags are used, they must somehow be pro-
tected, either in a pack, or in a pocket and with some luck
they will make it out in one piece.
So, what is the point of all of this?
Two reasons,
The first is to offer a couple of suggestions if you need
to change carbide and you have no means of carrying it out and
must dispose of it. It is important to dispose of it in such
a manner that it can not be seen and so that it will not dis-
turb the environment of the cave,
The first suggestion, then, pertains to where the spent
carbide is dumped. The prime medium by which the spent carbide
is distributed through the cave environment is water. As with
Justry, the problem is not so much the waste products, but
