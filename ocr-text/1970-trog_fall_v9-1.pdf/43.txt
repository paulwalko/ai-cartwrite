THE TECH TROGLODYTE

was the way Cartwright discovered America on February 29, 1491
(1491 wasn't a leap year, but Cartwright doesn't know that).
Thus Cartwright beat Columbus by a year, but he never got
any recognition for this, because he never bothered to go back
to Europe and tell people about America,
(*Years ago "cavers" called themselves "speleos")

((Also provided we find the rest of the early editions of the
Grotto Grapevine))

WHO DONE IT?
When you're flat upon your back,
Crawling thru sone devilish crack,
And your canteen pulls and jerks,
Which is one of its queer quirks,
Who done it?
Every caver knows!
When you're climbing down a ladder,
Swinging freely, getting madder,
And an avalanche of dirt
Comes right down inside your shirt,
Who done it?
Every caver knows!
When you're chimneying - knees and elbows,
Going up where - only God knows,
If you slip and fall below,
Just aluna red feet or 30,
Who done it?
Every caver knows -
- It's Cartwright! A.I,!
