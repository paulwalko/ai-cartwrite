A VISIT TO THE CAVERNS OF SONORA
I don't remember where or when I first heard of the
Caverns of Sonora, but when I did it stuck in my memory as a
place I would have to visit soneday. My impression was that it
was the most beautiful cavern in the world. .
Riding through Texas one would expect to see some adver-
tising for a cave purported to be so beautiful, but no adver-
tising was seen until we got within a few miles of the cave.
Sure enough, the signs claimed that Sonora was the world's most
beautiful cavern.
The fact that Sonora is not widely known for its beauty
is probably due to its location, tucked away in the hills near
Sonora, Texas, When Fred Hines, Rick Weber, Winston Harmon,
and I arrived we were the only visitors and therefore had a
somewhat "private" tour through the cave, Our guide through
the caverns was a former Texas Speleological Association
president, Jack Burch (NSS 2175), who gave us an excellent
insight into the nature and history of the cave,
Caverns of Sonora, once known to cavers as Mayfield Cave,
was formed in a unique manner. Throughout its formation it was
an entirely sealed chamber filled partly with water. The
entrance came much later, and being very small, did not allow
any mud to enter the cave, The result is an immaculate cave,
having none of the all too familiar mud covered walls and floors
(and formations) so common in eastern cavÄ™s. In our tour of an
hour and a half I don't remember seeing one dirty spot in the
entire cave.
All four of us found it rather hard to believe that any one
cave could have such a tremendous monopoly on beautiful forma-
tions. The formations are so profuse throughout the cave that
in places the caverris floors, walls, and ceiling are completely
adorned. It was a wonder to us that they were able to run tour
paths through the cave, Some of the more famous formations are
the "War Clubs" and the "Butterfly", both beautiful and unique.
Literally billions of helectites occupy every square inch of
portions of the cavern.
Jack assured us that we were seeing only a small portion
of the explored cave and made us all envious as he told us about
his off duty hours of exploring in parts of the cave that would
rival the toured section in splendor,
When someone tells you that the Caverns of Sonora are the
mosi beautiful in the world - you can believe it!
