FURTHER ADVENTURES ON THE TRAIL OF THE LONESOME PINE
or
THE SAGA OF B-C CAVERNS
The Tech Troglodyte, Spring, 1968, Vol. VI, No. 2, carried
an article by H.H. Stevens, entitled "B,C. Caverns." This
article claims no connection to that, although this author did
room with H.H. Stevens.)
During the Dirty Old Man's Convention of 1967, John Hol-
singer asked Tom Vigour, Phil Lucas, John Tichenor, Bob Barlow,
Ollie and Wayne Fordham to check out a small cave near Gate
City, Virginia, known as Collin's Cave. A quick scramble down
a steep, slimy entrance and across a large rooi brought the
cavers to a drop of about 30 feet, with big cave beyond, With
no vertical gear along, they left.
With this insignificant start, begins the Saga of B-C
Caverns,
Two days later, Tichenor, Barlow, and Vigour were back with
ladders. This tine they negotiated the drop, bothered only by
the many trees, boards, and wire placed by locals attempting to
explore the cave. This was also the first confrontation made
with B-C MUD; a nixture of epoxy glue and orange peel, and hav-
ing the consistency of Crisco and Gleen toothpaste mixed with
dirt, Six hours of surveying in cold November water resulted
in about 2000 feet ma pped downstream and Tichenor suffering
from exposure.
The first weekend in May, 1968, saw Vigour return with
Sharon Priest, Jin Dawson, and Russ Peterson, Ten hours of
surveying and poking around ended with most of upstream Collin's
mapped, and an apparent connection made with neighboring Blair's
Cave, a small cave mapped sone years before by Lucas, Bauer, and
Biggers.
Memorial Day weekend, 1968, saw many, many cavers convene
at the Pennington Gap Fairgrounds for three days of Virginia
Region caving. Peterson, Vigour, Dawson, and Tink Willians
entered Collin's early in the morning of the 30th and surveyed
several hundred feet of naze to the left of the entrance.
Although this portion of the cave is dry, multi-levels and not
knowing which end of the needle points north resulted in ten
hours of surveying. Suppertine cane and since the entrance was
not far, the group decided to adjourn to Gate City for a meal,
and who shows up in Gate City, but Doug Yeatts with Sharon in
cow. After a hasty meal, the group headed back into Collin's
and began surveying the upper level, including several drops.
This section of the cave was once a huge room, but has
been half filled with sand and mud, and wherever water flows out
or the ceiling, a hole is bored in the floor, This presented no
