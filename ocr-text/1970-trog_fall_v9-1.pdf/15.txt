THE TECH TROGLODYTE

ropes and ladder, I decided to change carbide beforehand, I
carry a "carbide dump", a tin can of about one gallon capacity,
in the back of "Trog" (my car), and was going to dump the carbide
residue in it, I had set my lighted lamp about two feet away
on the ground and was sitting down as the lid to the can was
pried off. A six-foot flame leaped from the can and knocked
me back. The explosion extinguished the flame, I was very
fortunate in only suffering second-degree burns on the back of
my right hand and wrist, I could have easily sustained third-
degree burns of the face and whole arm,
Jette immediately applied first aid in treating the burn
(a first aid kit was just ten feet away). I was then able to
descend into the cave and retrieve the rigging. I was out
again in a half-hour, The affected area was thoroughly washed
later that night and examined and treated at the VPI Infirmary
the next day. The doctor commented that the efficient and
prompt first aid attention received would greatly aid in the
healing and had prevented infection thus far.
Analysis:
Apparently, acetylene gas had accumulated in the dump
from existing used carbide, The proximity of the lighted
carbide lamp (which had ignited the gas) was due to the need
for light as it was dark, The obvious fault was the lack of
air vents in the carbide dump lid to prevent accumulation of
acetylene. However, a first aid kit was readily available and
Jette had a working knowledge of first aid techniques. Hence,
three important benefits should be derived from the accident,
L)A carbide dump should be constructed such that acetylene
gas will not build up under pressure, 2)A good first aid kit
should be readily available, and 3)Personnel should be fam-
iliar with first aid practices,
In closing let it be sufficient to say that "Trog" still
carries the same carbide dump but it has been modified slightly,
there are several small air vents in the lid,

THE SAGA OF CLOVER HOLLOW
It was a dark and stormy 4th of July. But four fearless
cavers of the VPI Grotto of the NSS weren't bothered by this
grim situation, because they were attending the annual 4th of
July BYOL mapping and happiness party deep in the entrails
of Clover Hollow, the Vertical Cave of vertical caves. (Giles
County, Virginia)
It all started out as a harmless endeavor.Bill Douty
