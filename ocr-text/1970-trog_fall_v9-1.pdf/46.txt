So, after approximately 220 man-hours of labor, B-C Caverns
had 8100 feet of surveyed passage making it eligible for Long
Cave status (over two km, in length) and ranking it 18th long-

THE BALLAD OF NEW RIVER

The New River cuts through the Fool's Face divide,
Am

And her currents run deep and her waters run wide,
Your rapids have slashed us and drawn out our blood,
Oh, damn you, New River, we curse your thick mud,
Oh River, Oh River, the fight had begun,
There was no turning back till the battle was won,
We gathered together on the eastern shore,
With cases of beer and tubes by the score,
Said Vig to his ship mates, "We're in a fine state,
The damn raft's not built and now we're running late,"
Well we pushed on out til water reached our knees,
And like New World explorers, we challenged unknown seas,
The rafts were beat and tossed about, paper ships on the ocean,
Still we popped a few more beers and splattered suntan lotion,
Yes, the sun was hot and the beer was cold,
The women were brave and the men were bold,
But a drink's a drunk and it's plain to see,
That drunken bunch on New River made history.
We conquered New River that fateful day of May,
But the tale's not ended there's one thing more to say,
Though the raft's all have vanished, and the caver's they are
gone,
In the hills west of Blacksburg - New River is flowing on.
