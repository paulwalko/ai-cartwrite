FALL
THE TECH TROGLODYTE

We emerged from the cave at about two an, to find it rain-
ing. After a quick change of clothes, one good bump: coming
out of the field, and a fast trip to Dublin, the truckstop and
the thought of food looked great.
Hamburgers, Pepsis, and french-fries later, we found our-
selve's on the road to home. I was tired enough to not remember
how we got back, and from the contented snores of Pete and Liz,
I doubt that they remember either.
:
Once back and thinking, on now nice it was that we were back
early at 3:30 am, we discovered that the United States of Amer-
ica had pulled a trick on üs and enacted Daylight Saving Tige,
Instead of 3:30, it was 4:30. With this in mind, all of us :
headed for bed in the fastest manner possible.
Several days later, while playing with the brunton, I dis-
covered that the watch: I was wearing during the trip affected
brunton teadings.. Now there is a trip to Newberry's this
wewlion to re-map that section of cave... What I want to know
is:
Am I Really a Born Loser?

Did It Rub Off From Ed Loud?

curiosity was aroused and Don Davison, Ed Richardson, Jim .
Branken and I headed off to Spence Cåve,
After a stop at the Dollar Store for Don's socks and then
to the hardware store for tapes (this was to be a mapping trip)
and a charning hat (?) for Don, we parked and began to unload
the car. "If anyone forgot anything this time, that's too bad -
we're not going back", a voice boons out. Three minutes later.
that same voice - although not quite so booming - squeaked, "*!#
%*!, y socks! Hey, anyone see my socks?" The previous law
suddenly repealed, we chuckled as Don drove off across the
mountains to retrieve his socks. An hour and a half later we
started the climb to Spence.
Although the entrance was small, once inside I found out
that I could have been 15 feet tall and 20: coat hangers around
