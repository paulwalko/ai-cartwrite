CAVE MAPPING - THE OLD IMMORALITY
By 1891 the buffalo, that symbol of frontier America, was
exterminated as a wild species. Since the time when white. man
first blessed these shores, forty species of birds and mammals
have become extinct, the virgin forests have been cruelly raped,
and our wild, cascading rivers have been damned into silt-laden
cess pools, Our verdant prairies, our towering mountains, our
deep, quiet woodlands today are nothing but island remnants of
the old frontier, now awaiting execution. But wait! There is
a last frontier for the pioneer - the underground!
Male bovine exretement,
Our cave frontiers are being ravished as surely as the
American buffalo was ravished. The weapons are not dramatic,
Bruntons and tapes are quiet and unimposing - but they are as
relentless and vicious as the buffalo rifle. The last frontier
is being measured, and taped, and sketched at a rate that will
soon leave no frontiers and no pioneers,
A cave mapped is a frontier lost. Would Daniel Boone
have felt the same tinge of adventure, the same thrill of the
unknown if tie had been presented with a detailed map of Ken-
tucky's rivers and forests? Would Lewis and Clark have even
bothered to take their trip across America if the "unknown
territories" were not a blank on their crude map? A napped
cave is just another piece of ravished America. It is a little
muddier than the next suburb down the highway, but it has about
the same wilderness quality. Where is the thrill of an unknown
frontier if the caver can read about the hundred foot drop down
this or that passage? What incentive would drive the caver
through a tight mud crawlway if the map shows that it just dead
ends. What challenge is there in searching for that next mile
of virgin passage if it is known not to exist?
Some claim there are enough unmapped and unknown caves to
last forever. The same was said for our "endless" forests and
"uncountable" buffalo. They are gone, our last frontier is
on its last legs and it too, soon will be gone!
Now is the time to reject your immorality, brothers and
sisters; now is the time to cast away your bruntons and tapes,
Repent and destroy the devil's maps, Repent and save our
underground frontier.
Rev. D.S. Fox
