THE TECH TROGLODYTE

to go through the cave, The passage way was large with quite
a few formations. After mapping 150 feet, we cane to a drop,
Figuring we had put in a good day of mapping, we rigged the
drop. I kept thinking, "Well, so far their warnings were wrong,
so perhaps there isn't any mud eitheri" Hai .I was welcomed at
the bottom of the 180 foot drop with mudi mud, and more mud.
Curse you Frieders! My boots grew 13 sizes and I had to scrape
the mud off my legs to bend my knees. After slushing around
awhile, we came to a 200 foot drop, and Don decided to play
Daniel Boone and go down, in spite of all the words of warning
marked in the mud wallsi An hour later we heard a mouthful of
choice words echoing up the drop and we knew he was all right -
and so were the warnings. Eventually Don appeared - or rather
a walking, talking mud creature appeared. "Let's go home!"
At 7:00, Ed started up the mud caked rope and at 8:00 a
faint, exhausted voice mumbled "off rope". Don, who had been
pacing around the room like an expectant father, decided to go
up next. Forty-five minutes later he reached the top. Follow-
ing directions, Jim and I then tied the 150 foot rope to the two
ladders and the 300 foot rope onto them, "Sure it will work -
everything on the walls point up," But evidently, only 99% of
the things pointed up, and in accordance with Murphy's Laws*, the
ladders Jamned. They wouldn't go up and they wouldn't fall down..
At about 10:30 Don mumbled something about rescue status, Jim
and I looked at each other and chuckled, "Know any Polock jokes?
But they just didn't seem funny, it was too cold to laugh - our
mud coated lungs were freezing fast. Using one lanp, we search-
ed for the warnest corner, collecting firewood on the way (one
half a broom stick), and built a giant 2 x 3 inch campfire, We
sent up orders for hamburgers and marshmallows, but the service
was terrible. The fuel ran out and we began to look for an ele-
vator, Carlsbad and Luray have one, so we figured Spence must
too. No such luck and it was getting colder, My blood cells
were even shivering. Then at about midnight, after a verse of
"Auld Lang Syne", dinner and a dry coat and shirt were dropped
from heaven - or somewhere, Two freezing hours later the rescue
crew arrived. I could just picture Mike Frieders and Ned Cole-
man standing at the top laughing and yelling down "I told you
so!" But instead, like a spider tangled in its web, Bill Douty
came slowly down to the pit, Ages later, after much hassle and
fighting with the mud caked ascending gear, Jim made his escape,
To keep up the suspense and excitement of some present rumors,
the next hour or so is rated X. Finally I found the elevator
and took the scenic view up to the top, Fresh air never smelled
so good, Two days later I stopped shivering and last night's
shower removed the last of the mud,
Actually, it was a very relaxing cave, and if you hurry
and sign up now, I'm sure Don will take you there, Be the first
on your block to go to hell and come back!
