FALL
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
. 1970
Proceeding to the left this time, we soon reached the
shores of a massive body of water, in the liquid forn, Here
we paused to ponder our fate, Gathering up the remains of our
courage, Tom and I went down strean, Eighty feet later we
noticed those funny looking plants growing out of the ceiling
and we beat a hasty retreat,
For varias reasons I could not return for a year and a
half, During this tine my memory of Drain Drop was dulled,
and I was persuaded to return and finish the map. This time
the trip consisted of Boots, Pan Mohr, Leni Leonard, and myself,
On November 11, 1970 we departed. Three hours later we
pulled up to what at one time passed for a barn. On obtaining
permission to enter the "cave" we changed clothes, while pre-
paring for this final assault, an older type gentleman walked up
to us. He turned out to be the owner; I had obtained permission
from his mother,
"You going to try an git inta the cave?" - he asked
"Yes, why?". - I answered
"Waall, this big ol' piece o' rock slid down the hill an'
covered it up"
"Hmmm, that's interesting". - I replied, recalling my first
impression of the entrance.
"Waall, y'all can try an' git in, good luck"
So Pam and I walked on up to the "entrance" and sure
enough, it was gone, or rather it was now about six inches
square. We looked around and found a few logs to try to pry
the rock ofl. Of course, they promptly broke. Several attempts
Jater we decided to dig a new entrance two feet away. Great,
but in so doing we removed a portion of the dirt supporting
the rock which was blocking our entry.
In the following debate it was decided that I should go
dow first to test the rock. Well, it held and we all went down.
I wanted to check out the bottom of the drop so I continued
on down the ladder, Upon reaching the last rung I noticed the
floor ten feet below me. Shouting various appropriate obscen-
ities about having been told the drop was only 40 feet deep
(we were using a 48 foot ladder), I climbed back up to the
main passage,
Then as a true leader, I said "abort", but to no avail.
We headed for the stream, Cartwright again smiled upon us as
this time there was no stream, So we made preparations to
start mapping.
"Who has the notebook?" - I queried
"I do" - answered Boots
That was logical since I had handed it to her at the en-
trance,
"I've got the brunton, now who has the tape? - I asked
