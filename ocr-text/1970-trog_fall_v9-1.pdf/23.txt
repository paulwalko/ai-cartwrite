ance-breaking CRAWLING in the Paxton's of Giles co.,

0:20;70. Oh woe, another Fall and another bunch of *! #$@*!
trainees! You know, I see them come and I see them
go - each one different, but yet all the same - bums.
But has Clover Hollow been conquered?, has Pighole
given up its deep, dark, mystical secrets? Smokehole
still holds firm to its virgin passage (Bat guano on
you Russ Peterson). Is there a good map of Pig Hole
(may cave crickets. crawl up your nose, Thomas Vigour)?
Has anyone re-discovered the seven-second drop in
Newcastle Muiderhole (poor Paul)? And how about the
lorest (Farst?). Room in New River? (Tell us about how
it periodically closes up, eh Whitt?) - The Ol' Man,
VPI #19
3/20/70 Whatever happened to the little yellow flowers that
used to grow up on Brush Mountain? - Steve Kark
Well gang, that's about it for all the "funnies", There
has been a largé drop in the use of Pete's Restaurant, and
consequently, Pete's Log over the past few years. As proof,
in '67 there were 24 filled pages in the Log, in '68 there were
27, arid in '69 there were only 6. When I last checked for this
year, 1.970, there were only three (3) pages filled.
:
I feel this Log says a lot about Club History and I think,
it's sad to witness such a decline, Aren't groovy, ridiculous,
putty, and insane things happening anymore? (or doesn't anyone
eat anymore?) Here's a last entry that states best what I'm
trying to say:
5/19/70 Finally found a place to eat breakfast, The
Fardie House eats.... People should start coming to
Pete's more often, it's one of the best places in
town. That's about all, - Moose
