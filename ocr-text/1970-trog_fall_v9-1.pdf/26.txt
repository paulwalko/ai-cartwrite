DRAIN DROP CAVE
HARBORER OF EVIL INTENT
Everyone has mapped a cave which didn't really deserve
to be mapped. Well I have just joined the crowd., Drain Drop
is a cave, although after two trips there I feel that the term
cave is to lofty for this hole.
The first trip there was in the Spring of 1969. The suf-
ferants were Karen Good, herefortli known as Boots, Tom Roehr,
trip leader who has since graduated, Don Laifoon who stands on
his own merits, and myself,
After a ride of some two hours we arrived at the "cave".,
After obtaining permission to enter the "cave", we changed
behind the barn,
"You stepped in what, Don?"
We then loaded up with our gear and backpacked the 200 feet
to the entrance, The Drain Drop entrance is not very imposing,
in fact it is decomposing. It was roughly the size of a human
body (in size, but not in shape). It also had this funny look-
ing black tube hanging down into it. As we climbed down the
ladder to the main passage, some 20 feet, it became apparent
where the cave's name originated. The tube was a drain from
the farmer's cow trough higher up the hill, (Hence, the name
Train Drop)
Hanging up my clothes to drip dry, I looked down the main
drag, little realizing that this passage, four feet by ten, was
the largest in the entire: system. But, surveying 120 feet down
the passage soon brought me to the truth.
The "cave" presented us with an old stream channel-type
fissure that varied in width from seven to eight inches. This
idiocy continued for 120 feet.
We payed reverance to the great Cartwright, who, in his
magnificent benevolence, granted us more walking passage, The
fissure opened into a T-intersection. We went right, which was
our third mistake of the day, the first and second having been
to have gotten this far at all.
This right hand passage was interesting. For part of the
way the floor was only three inches thick, with a savage, four
foot drop below. Further on down the passage there were high
water marks from recent flooding. That was rather unnerving, but
what really sent me running were the funny looking plants grow-
ing out of the walls, clinging and tearing at our hapless
bodies, Turning around (because we had reached the end), we
turned up our lamps and burned our way back through the jungle
to the intersection.
