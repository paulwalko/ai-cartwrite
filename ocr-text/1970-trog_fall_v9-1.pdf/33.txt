THE COMMITTEE SPEAKS
Because of the rapid increase in the number of times the
club has been called on to extract one or gore of its members
from a cave lately, it seems that an article on the subject of
why this is occurring may be in order. We will look at ehe
incidents that have happened since Spring quarter and try to
draw some conclusions from them,
Case one:
Early in the Spring quarter of 1970, the club was Curve
upon to pull one of its girl trainees out of Clover Hollow,
The girl, Pam Mohr, had reached the entrance drop, but was
apparently suffering from exhaustion. The "rescue" was carried
out without incident. Pan recovered by the next morning with no
lasting ill effects,
This type of problem is perhaps one of the most difficult
to prevent, Pam looked as healthy and strong as anyone on the
trip and apparently felt so. An injury received on an earlier
caving trip - a torn ligament - was not bothering her enough
to make her think she could not do the cave. My own personal
belief is that this incident occurred because the cave itself
has been underrated. Clover Hollow has been visited so often
successfully that many of us tend to forget that it can be a
tiring trip, particularly if there are more than three or four
people and one has to wait at drops. Also, because many of us
have been through the cave several times, we are able to do it
with less effort. Hence, a person going through the cave for
the first time, with any kind of weakness, may be destined for
trouble. The solution, of course, it to show more respect for
the cave, but if a person says that he feels good, then what
are we to do? I and several other people in the club go caving
with latent physical problems that could cause trouble. We must
simply use judgement and care to keep out of potentially bad
shtuations,
