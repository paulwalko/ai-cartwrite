FALL
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1970
EDITOR'S COLUMN
In regard to the Editor's Column and other articles of
the Spring '70 Tech Troglodyte:
I have received word from various grapevine enthusiasts
that several readers didn't approve of some of my ideas or the
taste of some of the articles I published. Now, considering
that I've been "Trog" editor for a grand total of two issues
(this being the second), I feel I'm entitled to a few mis-
takes, Naturally, VPI cavers do not make mistakes! I guess
you can chalk it up to my sex! .
But what I'm getting at is this, I want The Tech Troglo-
dyte to be one of the best, if not the best, publication going.
As everyone knows, (but doesn't like to admit) this means
everybody, not just the "best writers" or the "most artistic",
getting involved. And this means straight forward criticism
comments, (I'm thankful for every bit of help) It's not an
easy job for Janet, Guy, and I to have a "feel" for format,
layout, and quality. We need help in the form of ideas and
suggestions. We may be overlooking something that's completely
obvious to some of you, and we'd like to know about it. This
means letting us know after we've made the mistakes, as well
as before, so we'll know better the next time,
This brings me back to my gripe about grapevine informa-
tion. It's OK and even constructive to a point, but wouldn't
it be better for those with helpful suggestions to tell one of
the editors rather than someone else, who just might get the
complaint messed-up before it ever even makes it to an editor?
This doesn't have to be something personal. For fear of ap-
pearing unfriendly, you can easily write your comment and send
it to the Trog Editor, care of the VPI Cave Club address shown
on the cover. Signed or not, legitimate gripes will be thor-
oughly discussed, and probably published with an editor's com-
ment in the next issue of The Trog.
I hope that you cavers (active and armchair) will appre-
ciate this problem. This publication needs an understanding
between its article submitters and publishers. In order that
we have a Trog published, we must have articles submitted,
An√• in order that the publication be' quality stuff, it must
have the interest of all. The more ideas that come out of you
readers, the more chance there will be of finding just the
right ones for this publication. The only way we're going to
learn anything is to have our mistakes corrected,
There's no way we can ever hope to thank enough those
who come out and help this publication, whether by writing
articies, thinking up and drawing cartoons, or even helping
to run the mimeo machine in the last desperate week before
distribution, To those, our hearts go out in really sincere
gratitude. You're wonderfull! It's to you who haven't shown
