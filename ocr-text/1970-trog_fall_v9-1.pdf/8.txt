overcoming your fear, do it for personal satisfaction, and not
for impressing people and trying to make them think you're
a super-caver. Besides, the people you're trying to impress
probably wouldn't be impressed anyway.
Anyone who has ever observed a flock of trainees has
noticed that occasionally there happens a novice who just
catches on to everything right away. This in itself is
rather admirable, but what is important is whether he or she
has the capacity to become a good caver and not just a super-
caver Does he have the ability to listen to others and learn
from more experienced people, or just plain ability? Remember,
if you are good and deserve recognition, you shall be recog-
nized. Sit back and let yourself be complimented; don't do it
yourself,
A good caver not only knows what himself is about, but
he knows how to get along with fellow cavers. This doesn't
mean that he's just a great guy at parties, but rather he's
willing to help anyone who's in trouble and he also lets
himself be helped, aboveground, as well as underground. There
are very few of us (hopefully) who would not give a hand to :
someone hanging by one hand over a hundred foot drop, The
kind of help I'm talking about is a little more subtle, It's
unreal what an encouraging word or two will do to someone who's
a little uptight, when they're having trouble. In most cases
a little confidence is all that is needed to get somebody over
a grim spot. Incidents that were potentially disastrous and
would have ended up rescue status have turned out OK because
of the encouragement that was given and the cooperation that
followed,
My final word to new cavers as well as old - don't look
so much at cavers as cavers, but rather, look at cavers as
people.
