COLD WATER
Oh Smoke Hole, oh Smoke Hole,
My feet are all wet,
It's over by boots,
It hasn't stopped yet.
It's rising, it's rising,
It's up to my knees,
I'm getting all 30gey,
I'm starting to freeze.
To deeper, to deepest,
And on with the quest,
On up to my waist,
Then up to my chest.
The exit, the exit,
Is filled near the top,
It's up to my chin,
It's finally stopped.
Oh Smoke Hole, oh Smoke Hole,
I made it somehow,
I'm wet and I'm tired,
I'm satisfied now.

During the War of 1812 and the Civil War, caves proved
to be a major source t'or salt peter for explosives, Reclamation
Com salt peter from cave earth is a relatively simple process,
The theory is based on differential solution and the utiliza-
son of different solubility factors of different salts at dif-
erent temperatures,

The first step involved placing some twigs in the tubs,
barreis, or vat, and then, on top of this, hay or straw, which
woul, be about a halt a foot thick wien pressed down. The
calireis were then filled with the dirt, and then with water,
The next day the water would be drained off and poured into a
Dr.700 barrel. This went on anywhere from one to three days,
