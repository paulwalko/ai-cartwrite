rather that it gets into the air or water and is distributed
into large areas of the environment, So when you have to dump
spent carbide, it is important to chose a place that is shel-
tered from flowing water year round. Spent carbide dumped in
a dry water course or beside a stream in summer may be washed
into the stream during wet weather conditions. Even then,
caves change and a safe place today may not be such in ten years.
How spent carbide is dumped is also important, especially
from the conservationist's point of view. Spent carbide dumped
on the surface and covered may be out of sight but it may still
be rather obvious that it is there. Covering a junked car with
burlap may hide the car, but it creates a new eye sore. A pile
of rocks, mud, or dirt that is obviously out of place can look
almost as unnatural as spent carbide left uncovered. This prob-
lem can be eliminated by making a hole, dumping the spent car- .
bide, and then filling the hole with the same or similar mater-
ial as was taken out.
Obviously, the best alternative is to carry out all spent
carbide. But the best alternative is often not practical.
This introduces the second reason for this discussion - an
alternative between dumping spent carbide with every change
and carrying out all spent carbide.
Many cavers carry some means, usually a baby bottle, for
carrying out their spent carbide. But a problem arises if
everyone on the trip doesn't or if the trip runs over ten hours
or so, The spent carbide containers become full and everyone
is forced to dump their spent carbide for the duration of the
trip. Unless everyone changes carbide at the same time, this
can result, unpremeditatively, in many small carbide dumps,
So as an alternative I would suggest that one or more
plastic bags be carried in a baby bottle. If the baby bottle
becomes full before the trip is concluded, the spent carbide
can then be emptied into a plastic bag, a knot tied in the top,
and either carried out, left at a permanent dump, or buried in
the manner indicated previously.
First of all, for those already carrying a spent carbide
baby bottle, it requires no additional bulk to carry a plastic
bag since it can be kept in the bottle until needed. It elim-
inates the problems of heat and gas collecting in the plastic
bag since the spent carbide would have been stored in the baby
bottle long enough to stop reacting. If the decision were made
not to carry out the bag of spent carbide, but rather to bury
it, the bag would confine the spent carbide and prevent its
spread or possible pollution of the cave environment. The
empty baby bottle would then continue to serve as a dump.
The intent of these suggestions is to provide an alternative
to the preferred practise of removing carbide completely from
ave. The important thing is to be aware of the problem
bose the best alternative considering the circumstance,
