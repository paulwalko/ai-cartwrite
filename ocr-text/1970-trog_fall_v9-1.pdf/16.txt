THE TECH TROGLODYTE_

involved in reading the 1943 edition. All he needed was
experienced personnel and through diligent searching and care-
ful screening he chose a crew, from the three volunteers, Dale
Parrott was the first chosen of the three. He was a fearless
vertical caver of Fantastic Pit renown who was truly interested
in the glory and fame that would be attained from being on the
endeavor. Then Ed Loud and I (Mike Frame), the Sleazy Riders
known in Pizza Huts all over the USA rounded out the crew,
Loading the equipment (three tons) in Douty's van, we
proceeded to the cave. After getting permission from the land
owner, we started our two day trip. We rigged the 65 foot
entrance drop and began lowering equipment (three tons). Among
the equipment on this trip, uncommon to mapping parties, vere
five 6-packs of PBR and one bottle of Cold Duck, and last, but
by all means the most important, a big green watermelon, The
most anxious moment of our entrance occurred when Dale was
rappeling down the entrance drop with the watermelon under his
ar'n, I was at the botton belaying as he started down. About
30 feet down it happened. The wall was slick from dripping water
and Dale lost his footing and balance; And did he let go of the
watermelon and grab the rope ? Not Dale, Knowing the impor-
tance of watermelon on the 4th of July and of the splattering
cualities of watermelon, he let go of the rope and grabbed the
watermelon, depending on my belay to stop him. And this con-
fidence in my belaying ability was not ill founded. I stopped
his fall and rappelled him to the bottom. After plumming the
drop, we started to map into the cave, lugging the equipment
(tliree tons) with us, Over the haystack, down the 20 foot
llowstone and 17 foot drop we proceeded. And then we were at
ule wanyon Room Drop. I rappeled down first and then came
Loud. Parrott and Douty began lowering equipment (three tons).
First down was the PBR, I have been on many caving trips,
(sporting and work), but I have never seen anything more in-
pressive than five 6-packs of PBR being lowered 75 feet. As
a salute to this grand occasion Loud and I asked for silence
as we popped the first two cans. But the fun was not over,
Loud and I were then the witnesses to what we believe to have
been a first in vertical caving...,the nude rappel. Dale,
using a rack, can be accredited with this first, After getting
everything and everyone down, we proceeded. Then I led the
party to the room that we used to camp in the two days we were
There. We set up camp, had dinner, and retired for the duration,
rising before sunrise (no sun in cave), we had a hearty break-
fast. Then began the endless hours of magnificent mappingi
Eh, what stations, reliable readings and noteworthy notes we
turned out, After 12 hours and 3000 feet of passage mapped,
we headed back to camp, ready to celebrate the fourth. We had
mapped through the Garbage Room to the Gypsum Room, down to
the Library and Mud River, .
While mapping in the Gypsum Room we met Janet Queisser and
Mike Kayes, who had come in to celebrate with us. Knowing the
party was BYOL, they had brought one 6-pack of Coors and a baby
