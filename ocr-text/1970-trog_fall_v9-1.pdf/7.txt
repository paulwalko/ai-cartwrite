So how about some of you taking an interest in the making
of a good "Trog", rather than in only the reading of a poor

WHAT IS A GOOD CAVER?
Every once in a while I've had people come up to me and
ask, "Is he (or she) a good caver?" At this inquiry I will
usually grit my teeth, look skyward, and mutter a couple of
"Hail Marys" and proceed to go into a rather lengthy discus-
sion, Maybe this is because I just like to complicate matters,
but I really think it is very difficult to answer such a
question simply.
First of all, let's face it gang, there just isn't that
much to knowing how to cave, Sure, your first rappel was may-
be a little bit scary, your first prussik was probably a real
pain and your first encounter with a carbide lamp was most
likely one of amazement. But, after a little practice, you
mastered the techniques, conquered the equipment, and maybe
even have done a pretty hairy vertical cave. Undoubtedly,
you felt a fine sense of accomplishment. Right here is where
I say "Big deal, so what!" Now before you go off with your
speleo-pride hurt, you must realize that just about anyone
can be taught sucessfully how to rappel, prussik, and the

caver
In efforts to look at things positively, I shall explain
what I feel is a good caver, rather than a bad one. Before I
do that, I must admit that I do have high and lofty admiration
for those accomplished cavers who know no fear, climb unclimb-
able climbs, and have caves like Ellison's and Golondrinas to
their credit. The point I'm trying to make is that while phys-
ical capabilities are to be admired, this is not the only
crit√©rion for a good caver, In other words, not all super-
cavers are good cavers and not all good cavers are super cav-
ers.
All of us are afraid of something, maybe not physical
afraid, but at least apprehensive. Fear is as much a part of
the human animal as is eating, sleeping, making love, and
laughing. Having fear is nothing to be ashamed of, but being
able to cope with that fear is what counts. You must admit
your fear and know your limits. Also, if you are set on
