THE TECH TROGLODYTE

usually care less what you do to the inside of his cave, but
the way you treat his property is of the utmost concern to him,
He will probably think twice about letting anyone on his land
again if a previous caver litters his woods, destroys his
fence, or is otherwise detrimental to his property. After all,
he is doing the caver a favor by allowing him on his land, for
the land-owner reaps no benefits from the caver. Therefore,
we should treat the cave-owner's courtesy and land with the
respect and consideration they deserve. No matter how trivial
or unimportant you think your actions may be, never hesitate
to be overly cautious about the possible ill effects to the
property before you act,

VIRGINIA REGION SPRING PROJECT
May 29-31, 1970
Moncove Lake, West Virginia
When I woke up late Friday night (the 29th), it was dark.
And I couldn't figure out where the drunken voices were coming
from. Then I realized that I was lying on the floor board of
our Bronco next to John Powers, John and I were blanketed with
beer cans, tossed heedlessly upon us by Whitt and Easter Pig,
I also realized we were close to Moncove Lake when our weaving
vehicle treaded water. I began to get excited. The only
parking place left was a 30Â° angle spot amidst thorny bushes
und perpendicular to Bill Douty's jolly green van. We almost
hit it, too, but fortunately Vig stuck his big toe out and we
missed it by a hair.
It was mighty cold up there, a lot colder than in Tennes-
see, but luckily I found Russ Peterson and managed to stay
fairly warm. Lynn and Danny Wright and Russ had stopped by to
socialize on their way to Seneca Rocks. Among the other person-
ages who somehow manage to associate themselves with VPI were to
be found the Dawsons, Tom Vigour, Janet Queisser, Bill Royster,
Jim Hixson, Linda, Gary Moss, Lynn Vinzant, Linda Heitz, and
Bob Amundson, Well, that's all I remember....
We finally bedded down quite late, and as Douty dozed off on
his straw mat, he said, "Good night, Jim."
"Good night, Bill."
"Good night, Annie."
"Good night, Bill."
"Good night, Whitt,"...
"Good night, Bill."
"Good night, Gary."
"Good night, Bili."
"Good night, Linda,"
"ARF!!"
