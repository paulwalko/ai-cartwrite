trouble until a vertically sided hole the width of the room and
20 feet deep was encountered. - Vigour and Dawson tumbled down
one side and began surveying the situation from the bottom,
After several futile, embarrasing attempts, they were still on
the bottom, Suddenly Dawson let out a horrible yell and attack-
ed a small jan brack.
Two minutes later, he and Vigour were out and looking down
a 60 foot drop, swearing; but Yeatts appeared with rope and
things started to move. Finally, after a total of 17 hours
underground, the group left the cave and looked for a place to
sleep. Thanks to a light rain, a building was desired. Sudden-
ly somebody mentioned the Moccasin Hills Country Club, and after
a brief session with the night watchman, everyone was bedded
down in the bath-house, complete with electricity and hot water.
Next morning disaster struck, The book with the maze notes
was gone, After questioning half the people in Gate City, and
looking through garbage cans and gutters, the group sadly headed
towards Pennington Gap and a rainy drunk.
Blair-Collins (now called B-C Caverns) sat untouched all
summer and into the fall. Then on Columbus Day, 1968, the Blue
Box pulled into the tobacco field above the cave. Vigour and
Peterson, sad at heart to be back, climbed out, accompanied by
the hottest surveying crew to hit the Trail of the Lonesome Pine
in many a day; Ed Loud, Paul Davis, Wes Thorne, and the funniest
comic team ever to appear in Southwestern Virginia, trainees
Bill Douty and Steve Kark. Thorne, Vigour, and Douty attacked
the maze again, while Peterson, Kark, and Loud, with an air
mactress, hiked off to check Mill Springs Cave, thought by
Folsinger to be the resurgence of B-C. Meanwhile, Davis hit
the sack, Ten hours later, Collin's was mapped, the resurgence
had been pushed several hundred wet feet to a siphon, and Davis
had awakened and was ready to party.
A rough map was drawn, and everyone breathed easy. No more
long trips from Blacksburg to Gate City, up the muddy trail past
the Country Club, down the lane, and into the tobacco field. No
more busted knees and clothes ruined by B-C MUD, no more camping
on wet cow-shit,
Dirty Old Man's 1969 and Tichenor, Vigour, and Paul Brough -
ton who had inherited the unfinished nap from Vigour) were back
in Pennington Gap. Holsinger announced that Blair's would be
Iliveyed by Broughton, and Mill Creek Cave by Vigour and Tichen-
or, since they had wet suits. So one more day was spent fight-
ing with B-C Caverns,
The finished nap finally appeared at Speleo 1970 with one
big question. Was the map of Mill Creek correct? Did the re-
surgence indeed flow backwards, or had Tichenor and Vigour read
the south end of the needle? The next day, Holsinger finally
entered the system and confirmed that, yes, the resurgence did,
