after which it was drained and placed in a tub or similar
vessel. This step allowed the water to leach the calcium ni-
trate or to dissolve the calcium nitrate as it permeated
through the dirt.
In the tub along with the water, or "liquor" as it was
called, was poured strong lye (potash obtained by leaching wood
ashes in a similar manner to the calcium nitrate). As long as
the lye continued to curdle or cloud the liquor, more was added.
The liquor was then strained through a cloth and placed in
another vessel. This step converted the calcium nitrate to
potash nitrate with calcium precipitating as an hydroxide,
After the liquor was strained, it was boiled. This caused
the solution of potash nitrate to increase in concentration by
evaporation of some of the water. The liquor was then strained
and allowed to cool. During this step crystals began to form.
When cold, the liquor that had not crystallized (called mother
liquor) was poured back into the pot of fresh liquor, as it
still had considerable saltpeter in it,
The crystals left were saltp√©ter crystals, but they had
to undergo further refining in order to be suitable for gun-
powder manufacture. The saltpeter was boiled in water again
and dipped onto a straining cloth. It ran from there into a
cooling trough where it was agitated by raking back and forth.
The crystals that formed here were taken out and placed in a
draining troughBy this time the crystals were white and after
draining for a day, they were taken to a washing board where
they were washed in cold water for an hour. The water was
drained off and as it had dissolved some of the nitrate, was
added to the mother liquor. The remaining crystals were dried,
the result being pure saltpeter, ready to be shipped to the
factory for the manufacture of gunpowder, :
