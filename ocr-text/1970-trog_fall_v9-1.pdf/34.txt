FALL
THE TICH TROGLODYTE
1970
Cave, a trip that is usually considered fairly rugged and ex-
tremely messy. Don was the only member along, and no one had
been in the cave before (at least down the drops). All went
fairly well until Don decided to pull the equipment up, At that
point he apparently decided to save time and instead of coiling
the two 30-foot cable ladders, to pull them up unrolled, with
rope tied to the end, also uncoiled. The final rope would be
re-rigged in when it reached the top and the remaining two
people at the bottom would prussik up it. This would have been
a good idea on a short, smooth-walled drop, but here the drop
was 180 feet, with many proirusions. The ladders, of course,
hung and could not be moved up or down. The rescue consisted
of untangling the resulting rope and ladder mess and re-rigging
another rope so the remaining people could get out. Again, no
one suffered any ill effects,
How can incidents like this be prevented? Having at least
two members along would help. Don had expressed belief on this
trip that he wished he had more members than just himself. This
is not so much because trainees cannot rig themselves in - on the
contrary, many trainees get to know their equipment very well in
a short time. The other experienced member would act as a check
on the leaders judgement, for a person often overlooks important
details when he alone must make a decision. This was the case
in Spence, and it can easily happen in other caves involving
a different set of circumstances. No doubt we now have several
more people in the club who have now picked up some good verti-
cal techniques. It is sad that they had to learn under the
conditions of Spence, but no doubt anyone who was involved in the
trip or the rescue will remember the lessons that were learned,
This year we seem to have another generally good group of
trainees, The people are willing to learn and quite eager to
cave (2000 nan hours in six weeks). The club's rescue system
has worked quite effectively in getting people out of difficul-
ties, with a minimum of trouble and publicity, in the shortest
possible time. We have had to correct an instructor or two in
the teaching and use of a single brake-bar (he was saying it
could be braked like a double, which is only true for a piece of
cable like my rope), but in all, things have worked out very
weil,
But what I like about these trainees is that they seem to
enjoy caving, and I think this is important, When caving, whetli
er for sport, mapping, conservation, or scientific work, ceases
to be fun and becomes a duty or a job, then the caver is losing
a great deal of the true value of caving, that of being able
to get away from the unpleasant realities of many phases of
life and just have a good time, HAR!!
