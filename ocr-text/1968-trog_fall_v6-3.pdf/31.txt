FALL
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1968
There was on the next morning a rising of the sun and in the afternoon
a rising of the Company, Those who were able discussed caving and
even talked of going to a cave, Some, although Few in number were
these, went and did this great Feat, Lo, upon their return, there
was great Rejoicing and an excuse for The Party to happen. And it
happened, even did it start and lasted until it stopped.
With the morning of the third day, it was realized that a great
tragedy was occuring and there was wailing and ģ:nashing of carabiners.
For it was Monday and all must return to their homes and assume
disguises, even of normal people, Yet, rejoice, give thanks, and
sing, for I say unto Ye: The Decree shall go out again . .

FALLEN. ROCK CAVE, TAZIWELL COUNTY, VIRGINIA
Date: October 5-6, 1968
Personnel: Mr. and Mrs, R, E, Whittemore, Cletus Lee, Tom Spears,
Paul Braughton, Russ Peterson.
Our one car and a Dronco party set out at 6:00 a.m. Saturday
to map Fallen Rock Cave, we bounced into the cave bize hours later and
raced on hands and knees to the Big Room! so we could start mapping.
Whitt had hopes that this would be a fellofas long cave - and he
was right.
:: My job was to ofserve the steel tape as it stretched between
the stations and make sure that it wasnt kinked, After sometime, .
feeling that this job cequired a more qualified and concentrate-on-
what-you're-doing type of person, I retired to the front with Russ
and we explored. virgin passage, while up front, another caver joined
our party. He was a mysterious fellow and he must have kept wandering
off at every station because Cletus and Tom were cor.stantly hollering
for him, I never got to meet that guy, but I know his name was Mark,
. I practiced caving conservation by dump ing my spent carbide in
a Bagcie which doubled as a tummy-warmer throughout the whole trip.
Not being spiritually endowed, we all had to walk through the waist-
deep water and not on it, 'There was a short stretch of craw.lway with
sparkling cimstone pools, sodastraws and lots of stalactites and
stalagmites, It was too far from the entrance to be consödered for
comercialization.
Having set 68 stations and mapped over 12,000 feet, Whitt decided
it was time to. lash out. The visions of drinking water and food
that waited for us on the outside helped us mush toward the entrance.
