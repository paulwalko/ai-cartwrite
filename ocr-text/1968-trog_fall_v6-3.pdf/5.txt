Webster's defines a "leader a sa person or thing that leads;
directing, commanding; or guiding head, as of a group or activity.":

proceed. It can hardly be argued that the highly technical nature of
many caving situations, and the skills necessary to negotiate cave
passages, require a degree of leadership skill and ability on the part
of each individual. :
: The individual must acquire these special skills and learn many
sophisticated techniques in order to cave safely and well. It falls to:
a group of people to learn these techniques and skills well enough to
teach them to new cavers. Thus they become leaders in the process of s.
this training. In turn, the persons taught are responsibie, eventually,
for the training of some new persons besiring leaders in their own ::..

course of caving.
Leadership comes in many colors, shapes and sizesi :"Binker Glock
has been in acussion with me on the subject of training and leadership
programs for some time. In a recent letter, she suggested tin: leadership
situations that are encountered,
A.
Shared responsibility for the party, (e.&., when a group of friends
who often cave together are at work) .. when two or more share the
responsibility for the well-being of the party, each taking charge
in the areas, (skill-wise as well as location-wise), in which he is
most capable, and handling situations of stress as a team, (so to
speak) who low each other and can apply themselves (more or less
without direct leadership) to the needs of the monent.
Total individual responsibility for the party, (,3., when there is
one experienced caver training 2 - 4 complete neophytes) - when
all decisions and judgements lie in the hands of a single individual,
who, in times of stress, must be able to give orders as needed, and
have ther taker inquestioningly, (until later), in order to maintain
the safety and generai welfare of the party.
Clear-cut cases of either situation described here are to be seen
in many caving trips in cany parts of the country and in many Gottos,
