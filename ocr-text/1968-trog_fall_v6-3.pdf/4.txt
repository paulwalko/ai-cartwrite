Although the club may sound supec organized, we're not. The
Committees merely carry out the administrative details required to .
keep the organization functioning. Since ithe club is large, these
details sonetimes, become of rent importance and must be handled by
committees to aviod: wasting time at tre meetings. An example of this
may be found in the newly formed Supplies Committee,
. If a proposal is presented during a meeting and becomes a hotly,
debated issue, a special committee is escablished to study the proposal
and present its recormendations. The nur ber of people in the club :
necessarily limits the lengti of debate during a meeting and cormittees
are used to keep the meetings functioning smoothly, The Committees are
chosen so as to represené both sides of the argument. We have been
lucky with our special committees in that the committee's recommen.
dations have been generally accepted without mucir idditional debate..
Let's hope that we contineu with good committees.
The Cave Club is organized to the extent that we are able to
handle most problems by corrittee, but we are not bogged down by too
much organization, Our special coraittées enable us to get over the
rough. spots that occur and allow the meetings to run smoothly. We
are definitely organized, but not bureaucrasized.
