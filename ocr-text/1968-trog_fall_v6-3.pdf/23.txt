TRIP REPORTS
Trip reports seen to be the nainstay of every caving publication
with authorship spanning from buddins journalists to journalizing butts,
Only the most dedicated reader dares brave his way th≈üough the entire
trip report jungle, but is usually rewarded for his efforts by seeing
his name mentioned (if only, derrogatorily) or being able to compare notes
with his fellow sufferers. So don your hip boots and bat repellent for
here we go once more. The selections following hopefully hit the major
events of the caving year, in part, starting on January 1, where else?
THE GROTHERS WHITTEMORE UNDERGROUND
.
. or
"GRIM FAIRY TRAILS
On New Year's Day, while enjoying the last two days of my Christo
mas leave, I was determined not to return without getting into at least
one cave. So, that night, Whitt and I decided to go to nearby Slusser's
Chapel Cave. I had heard a great deal about this cave and was quite
curious to explore it.
We reached the cave at about 7:30p.m. and without hesitance en-
tered its comparative warmth. Believe: me, after six months of just the
Monterey Peninsula and the Big Sur country, it was nice to be back in a
Virginia cave.
After the first crawlway I found Slusser's Chapel to be a fine cave.
There was a satisfactory amount of formations, : enough geology to keep
anyone interested, and, to my pleasure, plenty of cave life. Bestdes the
usual bats, salamanders, and other fauna I also observed Slusser's
Chapel's claim to biospeleological fame: its "living pools. I was
truly fascinated by the speed and agility, with which these fairly numer-
ous creatures could reach up and grab your feet as you attempted to
cross them. (Author's Note: Do not let this form of life cause you
fear, They are certainly less dangerous than the well-known Maidenae
formius, which many have survived.)
Whitt and I proceeded directly to the trunk channel, thereby
missing most of the famous small side passages. Upon reaching the main
river channel we turned right (naturally) and continued downstream a
short distance until we came to the first siphon. Here I decided that it
was time for a rest. After considering the dampness of the continuing
pa'ssage, the amount of cave to be seen, and the outside temperature
(approx, 10..), I objectively concluded that I wasn't quite up to it.
Having spent a lot of time in bed at the Fieldhouse on the previous
night, I was suffering from a lack of sleep.
Unfortunately, the only way out of the cave is the way you came in,
But, being the interesting cave that it is, it was no bother at all.
