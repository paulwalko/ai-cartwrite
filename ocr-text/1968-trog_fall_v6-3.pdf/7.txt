situations require a leader in some fort.!.' It may be shared, delegated,
or simply assur:ed in the course of trip, but it remains a consideration
of the trip. If leadership from above is disallowed, however, what form
should leadership assure?
Two cases of needed leadership have been shown earlier, with a group
of friends who know their own abilities and those of their fellow cavers,
and then with a group with one, or perhaps more experienced people assuming
responsibility for a group of novices. There remain the shades of groups
that lie between these extrezies, from experienced: cavers from other caving
organizations who may or may not have been fully trained in proper: ' :
technique, and who may or may not nave the physical ability to meet the
conditions of a particular cave, to the overconfident novice who can meet
the physical challenges and technical demands of the cave, who may have
caved for some time, but who remains a novice in matters of good judgement
and proper exercise of caution.
Elsewhere in the publication are comments by the officer in charge :
of the Grotten, 's training program for new cavers. I do not intend to
overlap his coinents and discussion of a training program. However,
as one who at fii'st was an outsider, meeting the trainee program as an
experienced and competant caver from another rozminization, I personally
was shocked and angered at the impostion of a period of trial prior to
full membership in the Grotto here at VPI. This state of shock may have
forced me to take stock of the trainee program as a proponent of a system
of training of leaders. Therefore, I feel the trainee erogram now used
has a function somewhat removed fron that of training novice cavers in
basic skills,
It is a requirement of a leader that he have the confidence of the
group of which he is the head. The first requirement of the VPI trainee
program is a three-month period of traineel status. During this time, I
found riyseif forced to adjust to the Grotto: its ideals were my own in
matters of intercet in cavins, in attitudes toward safety, and conservation.
To cave with this group, I had to adjust to its customs and intentions.
I soon found myself studying techniques used by the Grotto member.s
I watched the various members cave, and studied attitudes and personal
traits. I am sure that the converse was true, as well. At the end of
this period as a trainee, I felt that I was confident of the ability of
