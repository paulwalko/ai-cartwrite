THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1968
After leaving the wettest part of the cave, we had wrung out our
socks and hoped that our clothes wouidnºt freeze; but we lost to the
snow and ice, a frigid midnighs, isra half mile walk back to the car,
However, upon reaching it and dry cloches, we enjoyed the inter warming
satisfaction of reproving the old adage: Good things come in small :
flasks.

TO CASS CAVE, OR ABANDON HOPE
ALL YE WHO ENTER HERE.
We're going to Cass! We're going to Cass!
During the Easter holidays, our infamous leader, Bob Thrun, and
his cave rats consisting of Dee Snell, Jette Feduska, and Gary Mos's
left for the PSC Block House, after parking and watching the eclipse :
of the moon (during which Jette was violèncly moleste:t), we spent a
warm snugglie night at the Block House, Gary arrived later ww5:30
a.m.) Chortle, chortle!
The next morning was a promising one (for what we don't know).
Spam, spam, glorious span om our breakfast at a roadside tables, We **
spent most of our time filagging down: innocent motorists looking for a
match to light our stove. He finally reverted to more primitive methods
and used our carbide lamps.
We linally made it to the cave entrance after trudging about a quar-
ter of a mile, through a hollow. We got there about 12 or 12:30 pm, IS
THIS REALLY CASS?????
We charged up our "stirikies" and proceeded inward, Gary was in the
lead, with Jette and Dee following cautiously tiptoeing from rock to rock
trying to stay dry. Bob followed, carrying 300 feet of "white lightening'
(samp son 2 in 1).
We kept asking, "Is the water low, is the water low?" The boys' re.
ply was, 'Yes, yes, quite low, Brother, what a bunch of magpies."
Staying fairly: dry through the crawl, we reached the chimney to the
Belay. Loft. Many other remains were found there also. One could cons :
clude that this was a well lived-in place. Snicker, snort.
· The rope was rigged and Bob rappelled into the bowles' of the cave,
Dee was next .. "tweet; tweet, rappelling - tweet, tweet, off rope," :
Jette rigged in "tweet, tweet, rappelling - tweet, tweet, off rope.".
This cave sounded more like a bird sanctuary, but actually the tweets
were from our vertical whistles swiped iron ar. Alabana caver, Gary,
last. but not least, rappelled down. One of the most impressive aspects
of vertical caving is the sight of someone rappelling down, and all you
see is the reflection of their lamp.
