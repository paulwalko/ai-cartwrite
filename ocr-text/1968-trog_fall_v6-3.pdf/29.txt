FALL
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1968
Of course cavers like to cave, so londay, Tuesday, and Hednesday
saw many trips to few caves, On Monday our group and about 20 others
headed out (and we do mean out). to Indian Creele Caverns. A typical
-- Missouri cave with relatively large passage, Indian Creek had a "thin
film of moisture and mud on the floor about 2 feet deep. It was a
very enjoyable cave done in the true V?I blitz tactics by "Whitt?,
Annie, Jette, and myself. Our total time in the cave was about two
hours after covering 2/3 of the 12,000 foot cave,
The next day we tripped out to a cave near Willard, Missouri called
Big Cave. Our leader insisted on remaining silent as to the nature of
the cave, When we got to the cave entrance we found out that one
must do about a 100 foot belly crawl through about a foot of water to
gain entrance to the larger passage, also filled with water. This
cave, which our leader said was a mile and a half Long, took almost
one and a half houts to do. One of the best aspects of this trip was the
chance to come clean a few feet from the entrance to the cave by
lying down in the warm water of the Sac river.
Most of the evenings in the campsite were a scene of cavers
gathering to watch the sun go down (and the temperature too, hopefully).
The dew that fell during the night came like a heavy rain making it
necessary to cover everything or thin's were not worth saving in the
morning.
From all indications the field trips were a success. About fifty
cars banded together for a geology field trip along missouri's highways,
Gary McCutchen, Patty Wick, Jette and myself took the Biology field
trip to the Ozark Underground Laboratory (Tumbling Creek Cave), a truly
unique cave. Unlike the other Missouri caves we had seen, it had a
distinct lack of water filled pasages and wasn't near, as muddy,
A number of us decided to stray from the fifteen hundred feet of
walks and do the rest of the cave. The cave had large passage
throughout and a few large flowstone formations,
Wednesday was the start of the indoor sessions headed by the
internal organizations and the Congress of Grottoes, Wednesday
night's costume ball turned into a buffet supper, costume parade,
and a first run look at the ABC filming of Russ Gurnee's expedition
to a number of Mayan caves. Other indoor sessions on history, geology,.
and other cave related topics rounded out Friday and Saturday's
schedule. Of particular interest was a fantastic slide show on Fort
Stanton Cave and other caves of New Mexico,
Due to the absence of the 1969 Convention chairman, Dave McClurg,
delivered a slide show presentation of the planned convention in
Wyoming. He stressed that the theme will be to hunt for caves.
Nevin Davis's gasoline powered ascendor made Saturday's practical
session one of the most talked about. The twenty-three: pound device
equipped with a jumar safety could propel a two hundred pound man
up a rope at a fast cate to say the least,
