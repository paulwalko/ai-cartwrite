Several things are significant about the discovery, exploration
and mapping of this cave. First of all, it is an excellent indication
of the possibilities yet rena ining in Southwestern Virginia. In fact,
a good half dozen miler-core-long systems have been discovered in
Virginia since Interstate 81 Caye was mapped. Secondly, it causes one
to speculate on how mary: more caves, both large and small, await some
fortuitous incident such as the building of a road before they can be
entered by explorers.

THE PEAT CAVES OF THE GREAT DISMAL SWAMP
- SURVEY
In the vast reaches of the Great Disnal Swamp of Virginia and North
Carolina lie an unravished and unheard of myriad of caves. These are the
magnificent and forbidding Peat Caves of the Great Dismal. Over a thir.
teen year period the author and the world renowned speleologist, A. I.
Cartwright, systematically explored the known peat caves of the swamp.
The survey abruptly ended with the untimely death of the author when he
was eaten by a giant Troglobitic alligator. But his work shall live.
This report is to the Virginia Tech Grotto of the National Speleological
Society and dedicated in memory of the Intrepid author, .. ::
The geologic development of peat caves is as interesting as it is
vacuous. During extremely dry seasons the water table in some portions
of the swamp is drastiollowered and the peat, which underlies the whole
swamp becomes dehydrated and inflamable. During these periods, chance
fires may flare up and burn great holes down into the peat. These fires,
upon reaching the water table, spread out, smoldering their way through
the organic material and form the bewildering axa of underground passage
well known to swamp speleologists. The next heavy rain fills the new .'
caves, quenching the fires, but leaving giant caverns ready for explora.

The most famous of the Dismal Swamp Peat Caves is Hog Kole, This
is a totally vertical cave with a 268.9 foot entrance drop through the
peat ending on a floor composed of Pre-Cambrian organic sand. The cave's
unusual name was arrived at when the author's girl friend first discovered
the pit by falling through the covering mat of vegation. The system
was completely manned during the rescue attempt by: Dr. A. I. Cartwright,
The author's favorite and the most interesting fron a biological
standpoint is Phoney's Cave. It appears to be the oldest of the known
peat caves and over the eenturies has developed a population of cave..
adapted creatures known nowhere else. The troglobitic Cave Catfish is
an interesting example, It dwells in the maze of waterfilled lower
passages where it feeds on excretory droppings of Myotis alba, the White
Cave Bat, and the Cave Alligator, Caiman arbora, Myotis alba is the
