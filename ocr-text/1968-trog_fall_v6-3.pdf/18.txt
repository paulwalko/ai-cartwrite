FALL
THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1968
The worst was still to be shown these wide eyes,
Tennis shoes love mud as waxed siis lovesnow,side eyes,
... please close as your feet siip over that drop," I whispered. I
sometimes felt a firmly clasped hand, after I closed my eyes. ..
There were pauses in my new adventure of life and death, pauses
that filled my eyes with the wonder of creation, A drop of water,
and another, the passing of time and a bit of magic made the lively
sparkle of untouchable forms,
Too soon there was a solid floor, too soon the quiet magic was
like a dream.
