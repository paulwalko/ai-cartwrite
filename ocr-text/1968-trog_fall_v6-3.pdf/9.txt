lucifuga, the cave or spotted' tail salamander, It generally has orange

Often they are found climbing about on ko walls and ledges ocassionally
holding onto formations perely by their prehensile tail. These
salamanders sometimes attain the length of sever and one eighth
inches but average adults range from four to six inches,

The Long-tailed Salamander, Euricea longicordata, is another common
cave species. It looks quite a bit like tire Cave Salanander but is
yellower, has a more elongated form, and its tail spots are usually
merged into a dumbell shape, Long-tailed Salamanders prefer dryer
habitats 'than the moisture loving Cave Salamander, One specinen was
found crawling around in the relatively dry leaves at the bottom of
the entrance to Clover Hollow Caves The abundance of insects in such
situations provides food for salamanders and othe small predators
which may drop in,
The Spring Salamander, Gyrinophilus porphyriticus, is one of
the larger salananders found in Virginia caves, It is much thicker
than the Lorydea species and grows to a length of over eight inchesi
The color varies from molted brownish-pink to res and becomes darker
with age, Spring salamanders may be found in streams and dryer situations
in caves but it rarely climbs. There is some evidence that Spring
Salamanders can exist as troglophiles (species which can complete its life
cycle, either in a cave or out).
Pseudotriton ruber, the Red Salamander, is a medium length (four.
to six inch) thick backed salamander found in cave streams. It is
red or reddish orange with rounded spots of black on the upper surfaces.
old adults eventually turn dull purplish brown with many of the spots
running together. Red Salamanders usually lay clustered eggs in the
fall. The EET: hatch into larva which may grow up to four and a
half inches before changing into adult forn,
? One of the most unusual salamanders found in Virginia caves is
Aneides aeneus, the Green Salamander. It is a lichen-colored species
noted for its tree climbing ability Coutside caves). It occasionally
even lays its eggs in trees. In caves also these salamander's are
versatile climbers, v.sing expanded toe tips to cling with. When not
climbing, these amphibians have the ability to jump' several times their
length using their powerful hind legs.

These are some of the more common trogloxenic salamander's of
Virginia. Recognition of the species and knowledge of the habits of
salamanders and other cave life adds to the interest and fun of caving.
