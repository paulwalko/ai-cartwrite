Apparently, the drainage pattern of the swampa ove is such that when
several large moonshine stills W!3re destroyed by revenoors: a few years,
ago, all the alcohol settled in these pools. Seyeral more trips will
have to be made to truly ascertain the value of this cave.
In conclusion, it must be said that these few discovered peat
caves of the Great Dismal Swamp warrent increased notice by the world's
cavers. It is, hoped that this report will spur many speleologists
to forsake personal comfort and safety and to help in the great cause
of exploration and discovery..

Even in writing a short collection of poems, I find it best
to define a few terms: for my non-caving readers; to those who find.
mud uninspiring and to those who consider moonshine a foul-smelling
toxic drink. . ..,
a caver - unlike most, his life begins 6.ft, under
moonshine - a foul-smelling, toxic drink
mud - the wet form of dirt
guano - the dry form of dirt
carbide - a dry, chemical that, when mixed with water, smells like
Tom Vigour's long underwear and the gas formed is combustable
*also like Tom Vigour's underwear
swill - the most rotten ang pag tasting substance known to mar...
. .. which is eaten by cavers ...
SWILL.
A can of beans, a bottle of beer,
a loaf of bread, a rabbit!s ear. -
A jug of wine, a cricket's leg,
a dash of salt, a turtle's egg. ..
: We gather round the old tin pot
at the bottom of the hill.
We cook it til it's boiling hot,
and then we eat the swill,::..
A slice of pork, a chuck of ham,
a piece of cheese, a potted lamb. ,
A cup of flour, a speckled newt,
a pair of pants, a dirty boot,
01 Vigour grabs his spoon
and Yeatts, he grabs a cup.
While Pablo's already chewin.:
Big Moose is throwing up.
(Due to the firexpectemeof the editor,
the last two verses were put on the
next page, Sorry 'bout that, Steve.)
