... THE
WE
Another enchanting portion of the cave featured precariously balanced,
hanging breakdown, horrendous in dimensions, directly over the keyhole
passage--Whisper, baby! Before exiting at 5:00 PM We. located the much
sought-after connection to nearby plair Cave, which combined with Collin's
Cave yields over a mile of passage, .
At 7:00 PM accompanied by Doug Yeacts and Sharon Priest, and slightly
rested we advanced the evening assault on the cave. Another physical
and spiritual experience awarded by Collins was the redonning of wet
soggy thermal underwear.
In the course of mapping Doug and I commenced a climbing contest
to compare the, attributes of his golf-spiked footwear to my "engineering
slicks."? Contrary to expectations, he. ermerged victor and I in the throes
of physical frustration managed to lose the greater part of my pants,
Everyone seemed to acree that my. indecent attire was a very chic way of
celebrating my birthday. Finally at.4:30 AM Saturday, we anerged cold,
wet, and tired, but still courageous enough to sing praises of Collins
Cave.
To our dismay on Saturday inorning we discovered that 'seventeen
hour's worth of survey notes were unaccounted for. A hysterical search,
including every main Street garbage can in Pennington Gap yielded nothing.
On Sunday we returned to Blair Cave, with John Holsinger to validate the
Collins connection. Later that rainy afternoon, while returning home,
Moose gave a "hremans? exhibition of how to handle a Rambler sliding
out of control. Hisffeatwas so inspiring that Doug gave an encore minutes
later at the same location.
Just last weekend--October 12--110ose, Vig, Russ and Company returned
to Collins to remap the section of which the notes were lost. Fellow
cavers can certainly appreciate my extreme regret in not being able to
accompany them,

AN OUTSIDER'S VIEW
** Until Labor Day of this year my contact with cavers had been very
limited and all I had heard were stories told to me by two member of the
V?I Cave Club, After Labor Day I have come into contact with a great many
cavers and have found a new and interesting group of people. I cannot
attempt to explain what makes a caver, but have seen that most cavers have
a great fondness of the out-of-doors, A. caver must also be a little bit
of a masocist. He must learn to enjoy crawlins in mud, on rocks, and
living on candy bars and sogsy cigarettes, On Saturdays the caver must.
be ready to begin life with a hangover, and drive hundreds of miles. to go
underground and enjoy life,
