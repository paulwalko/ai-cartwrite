the cavers of the Grotto. I had been influenced, and had gained more
fully a knowledge of myself and my abilities as well as of those around
me, I found that I hai earried the confidence of those with whom I
caved, and found a place in the business of the Grotto as well as in the
training of new members and the conduct of trips,
In later research, I found that the present trainee progran embodies
a large part of the old leadership program, as found in the Constitution
of 1963, now discarded. As the program stands now in regard to training,
prospective members cave for a tine under the supervision of the Grotto
members, learning of the Grotto as the Grotto learns of them. In the
course of the probationary period, the trainee demonstrates his competence
with his equiprent, including lar.ip, rappel device, and ascending devices.
He also proves the knowledge of Delaying, conservation, proper tying
and use of various knots and bends, and other vital caving skills. These
are not learned in a class or series of lectures, but in a cave, or
-rather, a series of caves of varying conditions,
... In the course of this probationary period, the caver gains, skills,
in leadership, and in cooperation with leaders. Ideally, the individual
should become a fully qualified leader in his own right. This stage is
not reached, however, at the end of a set period of time. The maturity,
and judgement of the novice leader must solidify into full confidence
in himself and in his ability, ..
In the final determination, a leader is made by both taught skills,
and by his own interest and perseverence in caving. It is a Alghly
individualistic thing, this ability to lead, iany persons are not capable
of proclaiming themselves "LEADERS,"? but they do not need to do so, A .

It is the function of the VPI Grotto's trainee program to make this pro-

COMMON TROGLOXENIC SALAMANDERS OF VIRGINIA
: Although Virginia apparently lacks true troglobitic salamanders
- (species which spend their whole life cycle in caves), we do have a
fair abundance of part time cave dwelling specie's (trogloxenes). . .
These are found most comonly in twilight zone although they sometimes
wander much deeper underground, : Very little is known about even these:
more common salamanders, and especially of their adaptation to cave life. :
