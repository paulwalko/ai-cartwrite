THE TECH TROGLODYTE
1968
WITHEREST WITHERO'S
During the fourth annual Speleo. Go-Go, held at 'Aqua Campground
beside the blue-green Bullpasture River. in Highland County, Virginia, in
July 1968, the intrepid tean of Annie and both itc Whittemore led a third
a soudt in search of the elusive Withero's Cave in Bath County, Virginia,
At the first Speleo-Go-Go, the team was joined in their efforts to
discover the location of this cave by Barry Whittemore, Jim Cooper, and
Jack-the-Gypsy, only to hike through miles of wet undergrowth and high
weeds finding no' cave. Then, at the second Go-Go, the team made a second
effort to locate the cave. This time, they were aided by. Chief Running-
Mouth, Alex ?ope, who is famed for eternity due to an amazing performance
in Catewaba Murder hole, and none other than Barry Whittemore. This time
we found holelees sinkholes and old cars.
Does Withero's Cave really exist? I've heard that some people have
been there, Gretchen Reich said it was hard to find, An understatement,
But, still, the cave is mentioned in the "Book". It couldn't be a fig-
ment. Or could it?
The team decided that this was to be the last assault. Either we
found it this time, or never. "Whitt" decided that we should ask some-
one for advice, and who should have been there once before, and even remem-
bered how to find the cave, but the notable Bill Plummer. Good ole. Bili.
Dill could even pinpo int the cave on a topographic map, and supply',
accurate directions. Wonders will never cease,
..So, in order to document this memorable assault, the team was...
accompanied by the illustrious two some from the Ho.lston Valley Grotto,
Sam Pinkerton and Tom Hodges; and none other than everyone's friend,
Thomas S., Roehr; not to mention the Scuppernong Kid, Steve Kark; Nancy
DeJarnette, and the ever-popular, Linda Heitz.
After parking at the next house up from the one we stopped at two
years before, and getting all our gear together, we tromped up a "holler,
through a pasture, and would you befieve it, to the cave! There it was,
in the middle of the field, just down the hill from the cars we had found
on the last trip. My, my,
...Well. Withero's Cave has three entrances, We all went in the third
(so called by the nap), and at the first intersection, split up into two
groups consisting of "Whitt?, Sam, Linda and myself, and, the others, of
course, in the second group. The game was to see the whole cave without
seeing the other group, and to go in and out all the other entrances, .
ending up at the one we started at, ficcording to "Whitt" there is a
fourth exit being a small hole which issues one into the third entrance.
He thought he had found it through a tight fissure. It was sad that he
had to retrace his way back up that nasty place. Tsk.
One place of great interest is the Flat Room. But the best place
is "Hole-in-the-Wa11Â° Passage. You get to it from "Whitt's fissure,
The hole is about two feet in diameter, and is at the bottom of the wall
