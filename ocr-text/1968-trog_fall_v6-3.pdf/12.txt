FALL
THE DECITROGLODYTE
1958
g
Now, 500 feet is quite a bit for a cave in a road cut, but the -
overall prospects did not soen to warmint a mapping trip until the fall :
of .1966; over a year later, in October 15, a csey of six which included
Glen Davis, Ed Mozyan, Dave Mogloj, Ion Harris, Chip C1 Ok, and myself, ;
set out to map the cave,'. We arrived after a brief stop in Wytheville to
explain to an incredulous officer what six grubby guys in a beat-up:..
sedan were doing invading their peaceful backwoods community. For once
the Virginia Cave Survey cards paid off.
We began the survey at the entrance and proceeded toward the Big
Room. The party progressed smoothly, even though the lamp which McCloy
had borrowed from Cletus had no bottom. Harris and Clark left the
crew to explore leads near the entrance. .
The passage beyond the Big Room was a narrow, muddy fissure which
finally ended in a clay fill 1050 feet from the entrance. Congratulat-
ing ourselves on having cone a good afternoon's work, we headed for the
surface, We were soon met, however, by Clank and Harris, Thev were
completely soaked.
"What are you doing mapping a side passage?" they asked.". "The
real cave is down helow."
"Show me," was the general reaction, so we returned to a room
near the entrance, Tom Harris led us down a narrow slot and through
a low crawl onto a ledge ten feet above a large stream, We made our
way down over mounds of flowstone to the stream level,
"The downstream end only goes about a thousand feet," Tom said,
"it ends in a low siphon; we went about the same distance upstream be-
fore we came after you guys, It still: goes--all virgin.".
At that, we all headed upstream. The passage averaged'ten 'to fif-
teen feet high and wide, with the stream flowing throughout. Three
thousand feet later the passage ended where water filtered in through
breakdown. We rade our way back to the surface, noting one side passage
along the way. Emerging in a light drizzle, we returned to Blacksburg
by way of the Ranch House Restaurant in Dublin,
::. Two weeks later, a crew which included Glen Davis, Pat Ames, Anne.
Whittemore,. Mallory. Hightower, and I returned to finish the survey,
Mapping was easy along the upstream passage and the breakdown choke was
reached in about six hours. The side passage gave us some difficulty,
being low, but fortunately it was not too extensive. After retracing
our steps to the entrance, the two girls departed for the surface while
Glen, Hallory, and I began the downstream survey.
We came to the siphon in a little over an hour and closed out the .
survey with over 150 stations and slightly over a mile mapped. We made.
tracks for the Ranch House Restaurant, The food and service were abomin.
able, as usual, but it's the only place open after dark between Blacks-
burg and Bristol.
