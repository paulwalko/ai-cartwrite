FALL
THE TECH TROGLODYTE -
1968...: 29
After clining over much breakdown in the Big Roon, and seeing
the beautiful rinstone pools we carne upon the register in the
toilet bowl--which was in great need inot the registar, the "bowl").
he signed the registar and only ¿ fat black pages are left. (The
register has been there since 1961). A rien cre is needed--HINT.
We went back to the neat Crawl" Bob took many pictures of the
numerous formations, Afterwards we headed back and Gary started :
jumaring out. He was up .the rope in a vaży short time. :
THEN! It was Dee's turn to start up--on polypropylene prus-
icks, About 90 feet up the rupesi they started slipping. Gasp,
Gasp-*#1*#$. Bob tied another sling and carabiner on the rope
and Dee pulled it up and put it on. It worked fine for about
twenty feet and then they all started slipping: Dee suddenly
became quite religious. After loosing many nails and making many
imprints in the rope she finally made it to the Solar Ledge and
there many foot and hand holds were supplied to assist her way out,
Meanwhile Jette was catching quite a chill. In her welli
equipped cave pack she carried a NRC Rescue blanket (which she
willed to some poor unfortunate soul who may need it) and a can
of sterno.-ahhhh, warnth... She and Bob made good use of them in trying
to keep warm--Smirk, I wonder what went on-ask Jette!!! Finally a
faint soff roper was heard over the roaring waterfall. Since "poly"
prusicks did not seem to hold very well for Dee, Jette demanded loudly
for Gary's Jumars to be sent down. (It seemed to be the only word in her
limited vocabulary:) Up went the rope; down came the Jumars, Jette
rigged in and started the long ascent. The waterfall and the big room
left her speechless»-Jette speechless??? She became quite philosophical
when she realized hom much further she brid to go. After reaching the
solo ledge the "windbag" was no longer speechless. She was heard sputtering
** I have seen the coming of the Lord. Upon reaching the belay loft she
mumbled, "I have reached the mountain top.". After Jette bellowed "off rope";
Thrun camé speedily up the rope..
The rope was coiled and our gear packed and we started our exit,
demanding occasionally a shoulder or a head to assist us down from the
belay loft. Instead of tiptoeing through the water, we tromped through
it, knowing we had warm and dry B.V.D.'s waiting for us. We reached the
car between 11:30 and 12, channed our smelly, wet attire, and proceeded
to the "field houses which was packed for the Easter holidays, The next
morning we socialized with the multitudes of people, and then packed our
goodies and headed for home.
Cass Cave is truely a magnificient and beautiful cave, but an
extremely difficult one. It was well worth the trip, and everyone got
their jolly's.
