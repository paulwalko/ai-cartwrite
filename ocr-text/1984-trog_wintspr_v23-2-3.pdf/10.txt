"Well... Maybe it will come back.".
"Listen John," Steve firmly said. "The creature just van-
ished and I don't see any place in here that it could be hiding.
I think someone's trying to play a dirty joke on us. The best
thing to do is to get out of this damn cave and get some beer!"
Carrie was shocked. Her image of Steve crumbled before her
eyes. "What are you? Some kind of wimp?" She exploded. "We;'ve
only been in here for a little over three hours. We can at least
try to find out who's behind this!"
Steve's ego was badly bruised. "I'm not being a wimp!" He
tried to defend himself. "I just think we're on a goose chase,
and that we'd all have more fun doing the big rappel we'd orig-
inally planned on doing. If you want to look for this creature --
fine.
Carrie nodded her head. John was eagerly removing his, lens
cap. He practically dropped the camera, but caught it
by the strap.
They explored the entire room. Nothing. Taking the first
passage leading off, they came to another smaller room.
"Look, there's someone over there!" Carrie nodded towards
a far corner. A small man was taking a close up shot of a bat.
. "Dr. Sorensson:" John exclaimed. "What are you doing here?"
Startled, the man dropped his camera. The lens shattered.
He mournfully picked it up and turned around.
"I'm really sorry!" John whispered.
"Oh, well." Dr. Sorensson sighed. "I have a better camera
at home."
"Are you caving alone?" Steve demanded sternly.
Dr. Sorensson guiltily lowered his head. "I had a new
report on Chiroptera Gretus, and I just had to go check it out."
"But you sent me to look for the bat!" John exclaimed
hurtfully.
"I know. I know," the professor hurriedly said, "But I
had this obsession to look for it mysel√≠. Maybe it's professional
pride,"
"You should never go caving alone, " Steve reprimanded.
"It's exceedingly stupid!" He couldn't understand John's awe
of this nerdly man. Steve thought that Doctor Sorensson and
John would make a great pair.
Carrie was perplexed. There was something that bothered her,
"We left you right before caving. There's only one passage back
here..." She stared at Dr. Sorensson with growing fear.
"I've been waiting for you," Dr. Sorensson hissed evily. He
pulled out an ornate dagger and lunged at the three. Screams
echoed throughout the cave as the bodies fell.
"What an awful sight!" John exclaimed in anguish. "The bat
just ripped them apart."
"You're lucky it didn't attack you so badly:" A white coated
doctor leaned over John's bed. . "As it was, you managed to get
away with just the laceration on your neck."
"I've never been so thankful in my life!" John breathed a
sigh of relief.
"Do you want to see your visitor now?" The doctor asked
cautiously, "Or are you still feeling too weak?"
"Oh, please! I'm dying for company!"
