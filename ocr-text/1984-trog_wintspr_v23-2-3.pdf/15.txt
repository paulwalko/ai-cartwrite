just how much he deserved his award by contiuously "leaving his opin-
ion" and repeating over and over some paraphrase of "I'm not going to
run through this cave, I'm going to take my time.".
After "SobAlley", we started to encounter water. One particular
pool we had to cross was shallow on one side, but quite deep in the
middle; Ed found out the hard way. He doused any "exciting" thoughts
he may have been entertaining from seeing me nearly naked when he
started across the middle of the pool and found himself suddenly waist-
deep in cold cave water. We all had a chuckle at Ed's expense.
Next, we encountered passage that alternated between stream pas-
sage and breakdown, stream passage and breakdown, stream passage and
breakdown, and stream passage and breakdown for what seemed like for-
ever. I never thought it would end: Of course, it eventually did
stop, instead alternating between stream passage and more stream pas-
sage: The water ranged in depth from mid-calf to mid-thigh, although
it was almost deep enough for a cheap thrill in several places.
Eventually, we encountered the waterfall that marked almost
the end of the trip. Climbing through a small hole beside the stream,
we popped into an enormous breakdown room. Going up the other side
of the room to the Norman entrance of the cave was not easy, since
the rocks were not as steady as they looked, and I was worried about
sending a rock down on someone behind me. No one started any rock-
slides, though.
We emerged from the cave into a beautiful starry night and
tracked through the snow to the car. Everyone changed and started
drinking beer. Poor Ed! He wasn't as fast as everyone else and
was left trying to fit all the gear in the trunk while the rest of us
sat in the nice warm car with Coors and Doritoes. Finally, the trunk
was packed. Ed got in, and we drove off into the night...
