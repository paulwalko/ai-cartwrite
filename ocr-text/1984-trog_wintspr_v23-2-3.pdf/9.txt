The three cavers squeezed through the tight crawl and stood
up in a fairly large room. Steve, the leader, motioned a girl
and another guy to a low rock where they sat down to change
carbide. The other guy took out his flashlight and shined it
over the ceiling occasionally stopping the beam on the sleeping
bats.
"They just don't fit the description, John," the girl spoke
up. She glanced at the ceiling and shivered. "Maybe we're
lucky!"
"I think this is all pretty stupid, if you ask me!" Steve
exclaimed.
"Don't get so heated, Steve," John implored. "My nerves
are practically shot as it is!"
Â· Steve and Carrie looked on John disdainfully. Steve sec-
retly thought John was gay and trying to pick him up, while
Carrie thought John was the scum-of-the-earth. No way was she
going to put up with him breathing down her neck or trying to
lech on her: Needless to say, John wasn't exactly virile. He
had a nervous habit of blinking deeply, and his whole body
seemed to be one mass of quivering jello. Too bad his face was
deeply scarred by acne or else he might have been better looking.
"Maybe your biology friends were wrong," Carrie softly
said trying to soothe John's nerves. She had this maniacal
desire to shake John up and down and yell at him to stop blinking
and quivering.
John shook his head. "Dr. Sorensson has phtos of the bat
leaving this cave. I'm sure such an expert would not try to
collect data unless he had some good idea of what he would find."
"Oh come on!":"Steve exclaimed with an exasperated sigh.
"How could a bat that large get through those tight passages?"
Before John could reply, Carrie breathlessly said, "Look,"
and pointed her finger to a huge black object flying towards
them. The three stared in amazement as the object came closer.
John and Carrie started screaming as they could feel the creature's
breath on them. As suddenly as it approached, it disappeared.
"Where the hell did it go?" Steve questioned totally puzzled.
John fainted.
"What was it?" Carrie asked in vain. "It looked like a bat,
but it was the size of a human!"
Steve and Carrie looked at each other and realized they were
thinking the same thing. "Nah," Steve said to quiet their fears.
Then to change the subject, "We should try to get the bum up."
Steve shook John until he opened his eyes. "We found it!"
John squealed as he sprang to his feet. Despite his excitement,
he looked ready to bolt. Looking nervously around he stammered,
"I g-guess I should try to take a picture..." His voice trailed
off as he started rummaging through his camera bag.
"Of what?" Carrie asked sarcastically, "The pretty formations?"
The room was a particularly bleak chamber with nothing in it
except breakdown.
