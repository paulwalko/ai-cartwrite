CAVE Clocks
Is your watch allergic to water? Uncomfortable in your pocket?
Do you ever wonder what time it is while you're caving? The Cave
clock may be the answer that you've been waiting for.
. A Cave clock is simply a cheap little stick-up clock that's
been stuck inside a caver's helmet. All the parts, both the clock
and the adhesive Velcro dots may be purchased at the local K-Mart
or similar stores. To properly install your Cave clock, you must
find a spot inside your helmet where the clock will not interfere
with the fit of the helmet or your head. Carefully wash this spot
and let air dry. Stick one half of the Velcro dot on the clean
spot inside the helmet and the other half to the sticky stuff on
the back of the clock. After allowing each side to set for several
minutes your clock will be ready to be placed inside your helmet.
Although the clock can be affixed to your helmet without the
Velcro, the Velcro dot allows for easy removal to change the battery,
wash the helmet, or transfer the clock to a different helmet. Most
Cave Clocks can endure the weather inside a cave; it's sitting
inside a plastic bag with wet cave clothes for several days that
causes them to fog up. They don't always appreciate getting wet
inside the cave either, but then the inside of your helmet shouldn't
get wet unless you're doing some sloppy caving or you're doing some
REAL caving i.e. up to your nose in water.
WARNING: Cave Clocks must go underground at least once a week.
