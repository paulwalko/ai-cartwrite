. Carbide is also available at the board. Please don't drop it
everywhere; it is not fun to clean up: Violators will be used to
plumb virgin pits. Also, be reasonable in the amount of carbide you
take. People who take a year's supply at a time will be shot. If
This system gets abused, carbide will be available only when you
catch someone at home.
club equipment is also available. All gear should be returned
cleaner than when it was borrowed. Gear is only available if you
call me during the week so I can bring it to the Friday meeting

Rescue gear is also still in my possession. Talk to me person-

Oh - Good Lord
The Horse and Mule live thirty years,
Yet know nothing of wines and beers.
Most Goats and Sheep at twenty die,
And have never tasted Scotch or Rye.
A Cow drinks water by the ton,
So at eighteen is mostly done.
The Dog in milk and water soaks,
And then in twelve short years he croaks.
Your Modest sober, bone-dry Hen,
Lays eggs for Nogs, then dies at Ten.
All Animals are strictly dry,
They sinless live and swiftly die.
But sinful, Ginful, beer soaked man,
Survives three score years and ten.
While some of us, though mighty few, :
Stay sozzled till we're ninety-two.
Origin unknown.
