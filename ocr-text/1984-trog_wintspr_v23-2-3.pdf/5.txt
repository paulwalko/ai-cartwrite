SIGN-OUT SHEET ETIQUETTE
The sign-out sheet has been in existence for almost 20 years and is
hailed by many as one of the best safety precautions available. Unfortu-
nately, the effectiveness of the system can be reduced by such problems
as interpretation of ETA's, odd-time ETA's and wrong date or am/pm mis-
takes. The purpose of this commentary is not to complain but to add my
thoughts about a valuable caver service. These opinions are solely mine
and I would welcome any comments.
Two or three years ago a discussion centered on how we should react
when a properly signed-out trip neared its FTA. Some felt that rescuers
should be contacted and placed on standby, being ready to leave on a
search/rescue mission the minute ETA passed. Others thought that this
policy tended to cause too many "false starts" and inconvienienced the
potential rescuers. To avoid this ambiguity the following policy was
adopted: the minute an ETA passed without any word from members of the
signed-out party, search/rescue operations were to begin by making the
initial telephone calls. Try to keep this policy in mind both when
signing-out and when initiating search/rescue.
Odd-time ETA's are not always unavoidable, but when they are, every
effort should be made to keep to some accepted norm. By loose agreement,
most trips are not signed-out for periods ending between midnight and
Bam. Consider this: by indicating an ETA during the wee hours of the
moring you are asking someone to get out of bed to see if you've made it
back or not. I don't ask my friends to get out of bed at 3 or 4 am unless
it's an awfully good reason. A routine sign-out sheet check, in my opinion,
is not good enough. Other odd-time ETA's include weeknight trips, exam
week trips and quarter-breaks. Make sure someone is around to check the
sign-out sheet, or ask someone to.
Putting the wrong date on the ETA is a careless mistake; make every
effort to get it right. People will often ask if a trip is due back on
Saturday or Sunday so make it clear. Virtually all am/pm errors can be
avoided with the use of a 24-hour military clock. Noon versus midnight
(1200 vs. 2400 hrs.) would no longer be a problem.
Other points about the sign-out system warrant discussion. At the
top of the list is the need to identify all party members by complete
name, not just first or nicknames. This may be vital information should
it become necessary to involve police or other officials in rescue opera-
tions. Second, infrequently visited caves should be listed by their
complete name, preferably as in references such as Caves of Virginia or
Descriptions of Virginia Caves. New or unlisted caves should be accompanied
by detailed directions to the entrance.
Most of these points have been discussed at one time or another,
but this article is my synopsis of current sign-out policies. Be courteous
to the "keepers" of the sign-out sheet and treat it with the respect it
is due; it may someday be your only way out of a tough situation.
