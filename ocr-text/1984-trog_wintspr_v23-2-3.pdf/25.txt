VPI Club Store
The VPI grotto store under new management seeks to
expand and increase its usefulness by now stocking the
following items.
- 43" disposable flat webbing. Tired of untying
those bothersome water knots? This new paper webbing can :
be torn along the serrations or burned. Compact. Over
1000 sheets per roll.
- New lamp with revolving reflecter. Lights up
360° with a strobe effect. Good on trainee trips when only
person has gear. Also fun at disco parties.
- Used Carbide. Spring is coming and it will be
to pretty to go underground. Just buy a 6-pack and some
used carbide and disappear for a few hours. Then you can
tell every body you went caving.
- Continuous Rope. Looks like a floppy hula-hoop.
Since it has no end it can be used on any drop--from
Pighole to Ellisons. Lightweight.
- Labyrinth String. Useful for finding way out of
caves. Good for up to 100 ft!
- Bread Crumbs. Useful for finding way out of Cave
over 100 ft. Beware of cave rats!

as into caves. Three types:
