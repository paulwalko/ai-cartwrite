"Very well. But don't talk to him for long!" The doctor
left.
"Dr. Sorensson!" John exclaimed eagerly as Sorensson
closed the door and walked over to the bed.
"You can call me Nickolaus, John. I hope that I didn't
hurt you much!"
"Oh, I feel much better. You really gave me a fright though."
Dr. Sorensson shook his head sadly. "I'm afraid they gated
the cave, John. I'll have to find a new home. "
"You mean, we'll have to find a new home," John said softly
with a strange gleam in his eyes.
"And I was afraid you didn't care!" Dr. Sorensson exclaimed
with tears of joy springing to his eyes. The two "men" started
hugging and crying. "Of course I care:" sobbed John.
Dr. Sorensson stepped back. His face broke out into
a not so nice smile. "Well John, "he started, "We've got the rest
of everyone's lives to spend with each other."
"Yes, Nickolaus. I've been wanting this for a long time."
The End (Finally!)
CHRONOLOGY ON A SHORT ROPE I
I'm here at the end of my rope.
Floating, free in this space.
Held up by knots and light metal,
Supported by nylon and faith.
My friends said they'd be back to help me.
I goofed; that's a nice way to say
I'm not going to panic and scream.
But thanks to this knot, I'm not dead.
I haven't been here too long;
I don't have to look at my watch.
I spin clockwise a minute, then counter,
Counting hours in this yet unplumbed pit.
I'm a penitent form on my pearly white thread,
Here at the end of my rope.
Spinning around, watching my feet
Glide through a helix of vomit.
I wish I could stop for a moment.
There's just so much fun I can take.
They said they'd be back...
I've heard nothing since then.
