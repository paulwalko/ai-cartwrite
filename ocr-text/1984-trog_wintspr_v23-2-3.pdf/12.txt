Nellie's Via BT
The Story:
Wednesday afternoon, February 22, I wanted to go caving. I
recruited Greg Lewis, a fellow trainee, to accompany me. Due to our
lack of transportation, Nellie's Hole was our logical choice. Besides,
I wanted to see the cave that the Club depended on for experience in
it's early days. . .
We assembled our gear, walked to the sign-out sheet and then
boarded the Blacksburg Transit.
The BT dropped us off right at the end of Nellie's Cave Road.
Nice service. Um... we must be close...
. We managed to locate the landowner. His first comment was, "You
boys got a rope?"
Wow! We were expecting a rat hole.
If you've never been to Nellie's, you should at least check out the
entrance sometime. We rigged a handline to help negotiate the 25'
drop into the entrance. After the required garbage climb, we went on
to explore the rest of the cave.
We returned by way of the BT.
The Moral: Don't let not having a car stop you from caving. If you
really want to go caving, you will. If you want to prove this to yourself
loan me your car this weekend. '
Coming soon...
