TIGHT PASSAGES
(to the tune of Time Passages)
It was late in October, I was moving real slow
In a sumped out passage with no leads that show.
Eight hours back, carbide low,
It was time to make my body go
Quickly back through tight passages.
Miles of crawling in the fading light.
Tight passages
. Crawling through mud with no early end in sight.
Well, I'm not the kind to be caving too fast
The weekend's too short when the classes aren't passed.
The trips that are fun are the ones that don't last;
But how did I come to be mapping in these
Tight passages?
I'm sure there's something that I left behind in those
Tight passages,
Without a walkway or a stand-up place in sight.
Hear no echoes and find myself starting to learn
Elbow pads are a must
When you're making a turn
Crawling on gravel and clay.
