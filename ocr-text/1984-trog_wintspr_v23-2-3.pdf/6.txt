passage,
Unfortunately the above trip hasn't happened yet, but it will
make a good example. If the cave is not a familiar one, bring a
separate sheet of paper to tack to the board giving road directions :
and the landowners name and phone number.
Under "Party", list full names of all people on the trip.(who
is AR, Pyro etc.)?
ETD means estimated time of departure from Blacksburg. If you
are at the sheet at 9:30 AM, but still have to get gas, food, and
pick someone else' up, sign out for 10:00 AM...
ETA means estimated time of arrival back in Blacksburg. You
should sign in immediately after returning, not after you get some-
thing to eat. It is easy to forget (and you are not easily for-
given.)
Please, please, please don't sign ETA as 12:00: You must
either make it 12:01 AM, 11:59 AM, or 12 mida, 12 noon.
Hours should be marked as: number of people X number of hours.
This helps us figure out man-hours at the end of the quarter.
Please write a remark; people like to see what you were doing.
Don't be a frat boy and write profanity on our sign out sheet.
This sheet is the most visible part of the cave club. My landlord,
my parents, and visiting grottoes read this sheet too: Let's not
prove you should be in a fraternity.
The greatest problem we have is people who don't follow the
above recommendations. The second greatest problem is people who
don't leave enough trip time. Give yourself time to get out of
B'burg, travel to and from the cave, change clothes going in and
coming out; do what you wanted to do in the cave and leave enough
leeway to avoid starting a rescue.
Current Rescue Rosters are available on the board. You should
carry one in your wallet and one in your car. A quarter taped to
each one will keep you from having to use an operator.
