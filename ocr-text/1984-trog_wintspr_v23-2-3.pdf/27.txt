Well, the exit is coming, now I'm part of a crowd
Of mapping trip cavers, and I'm feeling proud
Of the four hundred feet. I just mapped today.
(Till Hixson tells me
That I just mapped the wrong
Tight passages!)
I should have gone left where I took the fork right
Into those tight passages.
Stupidity is the thing I feel tonight.

AMATERASU
She's a poor man's riddle,
Unsolved, and of no allure.
But I love her,
And her bats sing sweetly for dinner.
That she is, in her capricious guises,
Is all that I need know.
In the dark, she smiles,
And her sprites fly softly past me.
She tells me come,
In beats of furry brown wings.
I answer in motion,
And I find her in everything I see.
Shrilly through the void
Her centuries echo.
Time ceases in her random will,
And I am still, hopeless, enslaved.
