TAZEWELL UPDATE
By: Garrie Rouse
We certainly did our share of digging and rock removal. Ask Honosky.
He took a scandalous picture of me scooping ice filled water with a cut
open milk jug just to see if there was any hint of an entrance, Roger Ken
and Jack Kehoe earn the "Tazewell diggerg" award this quarter. They were
continually removing rock, earth and garbage from sinkholes while I would
sit back cautiously eyeing which one would come up with the most promising
lead. It seems I was allways elected to push what ever hole they opened
up. Ask Honosky, I tried hard to get him to take over this prestigeous
job.
Roger has managed to make it on every trip we've taken to Tazewell.
One time he had to attend a funeral but even then he managed to catch up
with us in Thousand and One Care and help us finish up the mapping. Roger
has a list of leads about as long as long as his arm. The only problem
is I spend too much time to Mnd cave by the "scientific approach". When
a days worth of hunting is near an end and we still have not gotten under-
ground I succumb to Roger and let him show us one or two.
We had our second mapping trip into Cave Hollow and boy is that cavo
cold. Ask Honosky, he'll tell it to you straight (unfortunately). Robbie
Hickerson, Roger and I hopped over a fence to check out a likely looking
sink. No entrance, but digging in the earth there produced a burted treasure
of sorts. A music box with jewelry • some cheap, some expensive. We all
thought this was kind of strange and stopped digging. There is probably
more there. Who says you can't get rich caving.
Craig Furgenson didn't waste much time. He wanted to draw up his own
cave. So when we found Big Leak he took sketch and I played instrument
reader. I understand now why the brunton man complains so much. There
are enough rat holes out there for everyone to be head honcho at least
once. Now if we could only find that big one...
Well it seems we've put a lot of time and effort down in Tazewell
County and it wouldbe a crying shame if we didn't record our endeavors.
So here is the first of an ongoing report in true Holsie style:
BIG LEAK CAVE: Pounding Mill quadrangle, lat. 37°36'00" N.,
long. 87°38'54" W., elev. 2320
This is one of the many small caves that have been
opened up by the four-lane. The entrance is about 40 feet
above the road and gives access to a 30 foot climb down,
Several small passages are developed beyond this, one of
which connects back up to the entrance. Big Leak is
developed in Middle Ordovician limestone and has been
mapped by the VPI Grotto.
