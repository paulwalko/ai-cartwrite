CAVE HOLLOW: Pounding Mill quadrangle, lat, 37°06'45" N., long.
81° 41'44" W., elev. 2200.
The entrance is in a bluff of rock at the edge of a small sink.
It is about 3 feet wide and 2 feet high and gives access to a phreatic
passage which extends for 200 feet in a NE direction before onding
in a flowstone choke. Forty feet from the entrance is a narrow slot
in the floor which leads to a lower level. A rope is needed for this
45 foot drop. At the bottom there is a canyon passage extending in the
same nortbasterly direction as the upper level. After 250 feet a
stream is encountered. Following this downstream immediately leads
one to a terminal sump. Upstream the passage continues as a tall
canyon in a NE direction for another 1500 feet before ending in
breakdown. Cave Hollow is developed along strike in steeply dipping
Greenbrier limestone and is currently being explored and mapped by
the VPI Grotto.
HAMMER HOLE: Amonate quadrangle, lat, 37°08'06" N., long. 81° 40'34"
W., elev, 2560.
This cave was found by a plume of steam issuing from its entrance,
Removal of rocks uncovered a tight opening which gives access to a
small room, four feet high and approximately twelve foot in diameter.
Digging in the floor of this room produced a low sloping passage with
several dead end leads. Hammer Holo is developed in Greenbrior limo-
stone.
LITTLE RIVER ROADCUT CAVES: Richlands quadrangle, lat. 37°02'27" N.,
long. 81°47'54" W., elov. 2060.
These are caves that have been opened up by blasting for the road.
There are at least two caves, one of which has several hundred feet of
passage. None of these were fully explored. The little River Road-
cuts are developed in Middle Ordovician limestone.
RONNIE KEEN'S CAVE: Pounding Mill quadranglo, lat. 37°05' 28" N., long.
81' 40'37" W., elev. 2200.
The entrance to this cave is about 20 root above the Clinch
River. The cave is approximately 200 foot long and narrows to a
crawl at the far end. A slot to the right gives access to a 10 foot
high canyon which quickly dies in both directions.
SILVER MINE CAVE: Pounding Mill quadrangl., lat. 37°07'03" N., long.
81' 41' 42" W., elev, 2380.
This cave is nothing more than a very narrow Assure which drops
for approximately 60 feet and pinches out in either direction. Accor
ding to local reports a nearby, rock-wallod sink had been converted
into a dwelling by a hormet. He apparontly lived there for a number
of years while digging and blasting at the cave, for what no one is
quite sure.
