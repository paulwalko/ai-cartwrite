SINKS #1 CAVE: Richlands quadranglo, lat. 37°04'21" N., long.
81° 49157" W., elev, 2160.
Sinks #1 is located at the bottom of a deep hollow. The en-
trance is a vertical fissure and takes a small stream. Inside one
follows a narrow, tortuous canyon for about 100 feet to an apparent
end. In the floor, a small slot gives access to a stroam crawl which
in turn leads to a 20 foot drop for which a rope is noeded. At
the bootom of this drop is a tall canyon that leads to the bottom of
an 80 foot dome. A ceiling chamel reveals a continuing passage at
the top but this is unreachablo. A load through breakdom gives
access, once again, to a narrow, sinuous canyon. After about 200
feet the stream dissapears under a low shell and cannot be followed
furthur. Sinks #1 is developed in nearly vertically dipping Green-
brier limestone.
THOUSAND AND ONE CAVE: Pounding Mill quadrangle, lat. 37°05'02" N.,
long. 81° 41'44". W., elev. 2200.
The entrance to Thousand and One is within 100 foot of the four-
lane. It is located at the bottom of a small blull and is about 2
foot high and 3 feet wide. The entrance slopes downward and immed-
iately opens up into a fair sized passage approximately 30 feet wide
and 15 lost high. This continues for over 600 fest in a NE direction
with very little in the way of side passages. Beyond this the main
passage becomes a low cravl over breakdown slabs and shallow pools
before ending in a formation choke. Thousand and One is developed
along strike and is found in Middle Ordovician limestono. A map
of the cave appears in this issue.
WIRM HOLE:Amonate quadrangle, lat. 37° 08'08" N., long. 81° 40' 35"
Wo, elev, 2540.
This cave is about 100 yards north of Hammer Hole and, like the
latter, was found by steam coming... from its ontrance. Removal of
some rocks produced a squeeze entrance with a 25 foot climable pit.
There were no loads. Despite the plume of steam, the air at the bottom
of the pit was quite dead.
WRIC CAVE: Richlands quadrangle, lat. 37°05'11" N., long. 81° 46'57"
W., elev. 1980.
Several openings are found at this road cut along the Clinch
River. The only one that goos is the smallerofthe entrances and is
situated at the lover, far-right. The cave extends straight back
as a crawl and ends after about 50 feet. A low, wido load just in-
side the ontrance and to the left, however, gives access to a hands
and knees crawl. This passage parallels the former and continues
back for at least 200 feet before ending in a breakdown choke.
