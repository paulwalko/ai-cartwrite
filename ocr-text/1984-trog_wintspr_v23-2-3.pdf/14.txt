A TALE OF TWO ? CAVES
It was the best of. caves; it was the worst of caves. It was
a cave of wet, and a cave of dry... I refer to that West Virginia
wonder, Bone-Norman.
. After driving through such: notable places as Ronceverte (pro-
nounced "Rainchy Fart") and some of the "scenic" rural areas for
which West Virginia is justly famous, we arrived at the cave. The
Bone entrance is about half-way up the wall of an old limestone quarry,
with a talus s.lope leading to the entrance. While we (Josephine, Chuck,
Hank-a-trainee, and I) waited for the rest of our party (Jin, Â· Ed,
Chris Smith-obnoxious-trainee) to shuttle a car to the Norman entrance,
Chuck entertained us witii a little creative boulder rolling.
The rest of the party soon returned, and we all cooed and aahed
at the "accelerated geclcsy" (ie. ice formations) we identified at
the cave's entrance. Climbing over the ice was quite a challenge,
even with the pull-down handline Jim rigged, but we all made it in
one piece. Two steps past the edge of the ice, THE DUST began. Some
of us (myself included) whipped out bandannas and went with the "ban-

which was worse, inhaling THE DUST or coping with THE DAMNED BANDANNA.
After much crawling and walking through the flour-like gust for
two years, we finally reached "The Devil's Pinch." Jim took off his
jacket and scooted through; Chuck took off his jacket and forced his
way through; Hank didn't take anything off to get through. Sad to say,
however, I was not so lucky. I found out the hard way that, grunt and
push as you will, hips just won't "give" the way chests will. A pair
of pants later, I was on the other side of the pinch, having been
quite "intimate" with the surrounding rock in the meantime. Ed came
through next, minus all upper body clothing but a t-shirt. Josephine
and Chris zipped through even before Ed got all his clothes back on.
Next came "Sob Alley", a long, dusty, and appropriately-named
_crawlway.... Chris Smith, the Most Obnoxious Trainee of the Year, proved
