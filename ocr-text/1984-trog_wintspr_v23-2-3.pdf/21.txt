TO GO WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE...
Virgin passage was ahead for sure
It would be tight
But better: to cave
Than to stay up all night
He went a crusing down the canyon
One thing on his mind
Breathing heavy, laiden with gear
His trainee tried not to fall behind
Troglo-critters and cavers
Alike all knew
That this guy meant business
So away they flew
His bow.legged pace
Was long and deliberate
The air about him showed conceit
Every bit of it
The trainee looked at him
As if he were God
For the muscles from him did bulge
Oh what a bod
Through the lakes they would swim
And the siphons they would dive
The poor trainee could only think
Of coming out alive
Now the apprentice
Exotic fantasies no longer in head
Really began to wish
She had stayed home in bed
Exposure didn't
Bother him at all
Because he knew that he was
Much too good to fall
So he climbed over the breakdown
And across a pit
Second thoughts in mind
The trainee could only think, "Oh shit."
Virgin passage was ahead for sure
Break the soda straws around the bend
The pain of the quest
Would be pleasure in the end
Tascho
