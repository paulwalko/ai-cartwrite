The Cave Conservance of the Virginias has received ownership of Slusser's
Chapel Cave of. Montgomery County, Virginia for protection as a biological
preserve. The two acres, which include the sinkhole and the cave entrance,
were donated by Dr. Anatol Ryplansky of Radford, Virginia, in December of
. last year. The cave will be managed as a biological preserve with special
attention to two rare troglobitic arthropods, the Vandel's .Cave Isopod
(Caecidotea vandeli (Bresson) ), and the Montgomery County Cave Amphipod
(Stygobromus fergusoni Holsinger). The Stewardship Committee will pro-
pose a Mangagement Plan that will protect these and other of the cave's
organisms by first, preserving and protecting the quality of the groundwater,
and second, protecting the habitats from disturbance.
