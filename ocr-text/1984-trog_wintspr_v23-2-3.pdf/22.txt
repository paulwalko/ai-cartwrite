How to be a Voting Trainee
: 0.K., you went through the shit and they call you a i
voting trainee, but officially you are a member. Now you
can take it easy, and don't have to cave anymore. All of the
trips going out are to hard ("I'm a member' I don't have
I lost my whistle. Sorry guys). The best caving is done
with fellow members or experienced cavers who have their
act together. Once a member you find out their act wasn't
as good as you hoped it was when you were a trainee (but some-
one is bound to have a spare light source).
As a new member you often take trips where you're
the responsable one with the most experience. These are
called trainee trips. This is usually a drag pulling the
scum through caves but you try not to ruin the trip for them.
There are tips for maximizing the distance out of a trainee.
Instead of taking off and waiting for them to catch up, stay
with them because they move even slower without a guide.
Keep scum apart if possible to prevent mutxiny. Urge them
on with encouraging words ("rest stop ahead." "Pretty speleo-
of cuvifs, you
junk!' "There's room to sit up ahead'). "Above don't let
on that you're lost or unsure. It's hard to get anyone to
follow you under those conditions. In some cases these trips
are actually fun for the experienced caver. One case
is that of the over eager trainee (Oh wow! Neato! Neato!
What's that?" "That? That's a carbide dump!!)
