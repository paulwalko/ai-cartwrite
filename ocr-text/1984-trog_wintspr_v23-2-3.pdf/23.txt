Caving experience answers a lot of questions you had
as a trainee but opens up a world of others (Where does
the air come from? Where does the water go? Where is my
spare parts kit? When was the last time this rope tested?
How does a person with my English grades actually get
published? Why?. . .).
CHRONOLOGY ON A SHORT ROPE II
..
I've wasted a century waiting.
My good friends still haven't returned.
Where are those bastards? I need them.
I'm past sense of fingers and toes.
I'm shivering really bad now.
And panicking now, though I shouldn't.
I'm here at the end of my rope,
And scared...must get out of this place.
My screams for help echo unanswered;
The wall shouting back is no comfort.
I'll terminate here, in this cave,
A corpse, suspended in blackness.
Been quaking in darkness forever.
My lamp fell for lighting a smoke.
I'm freezing, and dreaming of sunlight;
If I'm not dead, I'm immortal.
Phosphenes, cobalt blue, fly past me.
Mercury lights lighting nothing.
My rope has now vanished to memory;
I see worlds I've never believed.
