Coming back from OTR, Travis gets bored and
wants to go caving since very little of it was
done by VPI this year except for a few that
were volunteered to rescue some ill-prepared
rock climbers. Yet when this wave of emotion
came over him in the back country of West
Virginia, there were no caves in sight.
Seeing a rock mountainside that may or may
not have a significant amount of limestone in it
to form a karst system, we tried our luck. Since
the road was more or less going parallel to the
mountainside instead of veering towards it, we
went off the right shoulder some and made a
sharp fishtail towards this large rock formation.
Unfortunately, 60 m.p.h. wasn't enough to
form a new cave entrance. This being the case,
it was decided that perhaps there was an
entrance further up the mountainside. Using
our vertical experience gained from VPI, we
start to flip up the mountainside a few times.
Alas, our search is in vain and we find no
entrance. We start to go back towards the road,
though at this point we forget to maintain three
points of contact and slide down on the side of
the truck quite fast. When the road is finally
upon us, I get a close encounter of the natural
asphalt formations that occur along this scenic
stretch of West Virginia. Travis manages at the
same time to finally break off the passenger
side view mirror that had been hanging
precariously the past few years.
Eventually, we stop and lose momentum from
our slide and decide we should get back to
Blacksburg. Unfortunately, trucks don't drive
very well on their side, so we attempt to rectify
this situation. Travis hangs from the ceiling and
unhooks a less superior variation of the VPI
tied seat harness that comes standard with most
vehicles these days. Travis forgot again to
maintain three points of contact when there
was a danger of falling. Travis then hit his thigh
on the stick and comes crashing down on me.
We sit there for a few seconds... it's dark, and
we have no functional light sources within
reach. We are in luck; we begin to look upwards
Uh oh, we forgot to obtain landowner's
permission before starting this expedition. One
landowner was on the toilet at the time and was
disturbed by having the shockwave shake her
bathroom door. We apologize for scaring her
and remark that it was fortunate that she was
on the toilet and thus didn't sh*t her pants.
Looking around, traffic is backing up. We go
back into the darkness of the truck to obtain
FRS radios to direct traffic, GPS, cell phone,
and a digital camera (yes, this is one of those
dreaded photo trips). What a surprise, no
phone service in this part of West Virginia.
The landowner graciously called the Rescue
Squad and the Fire Department, even though I
insisted that the dark brown liquid leaking from
the back of the truck was not gasoline. We then
examine the truck and begin to think about
setting up a 4-to-1 pulley system, though
having lost most of the beer we realize a 3-to-1
pulley system is sufficient. Being lazy, though,
we decide to send for a rescue instead and have
a tow truck come and flip over the truck for us.
The truck now has three points of contact with
the pavement. I insist this is enough for us to
get back to Blacksburg, though Travis is
