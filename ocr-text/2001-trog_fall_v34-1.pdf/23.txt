Captain Ed Fortney: has the power of
invincibility.
Bryce Bolton: has the power to melt minds,
including his own.
Mike Newsome: has the power of an inhuman
tolerance to substance as well as some sort of
funky 70's charismatic power. Mike also has the
ability to speak in the tongues of all children
and to make a game out of everything.
Joe Thompson: has the power to fly, however
each use of this power costs one vehicle. He
also has the power of testosterone poisoning.
Naomi Orndorff: has the power of having
anything dropped on her and she will still
laugh.
Sue Setzler: has the power of being almost as
strong as Berta.
Mike Malsbury: has the power of being a
helicopter.
Matt Burnett: has the power of being the most
mild mannered.
Penelope Pooler: has the power of
cluelessness and the power to engage mouth
before thinking.
Ed Richardson: has the power of fire. More
WOOD!
Jim Washington: has the power of GCCS as
well as the power of trivia.
Cecile James: has the power of chaos.
Jake Brown: has the power of a truly foul
mouth and like Kirk, he is also afraid of
veggies.
Mandie Aldrich: has the power of drama.
And last but not least, Dave â€œChummer"
Warren: has the ability to attract fish.
The are many fun and interesting stories behind
the super powers of a lot of Cave Club
members. Even the creation of this list has a
story. It was written on the back of a napkin,
while waiting for dinner at a restaurant with
really slow service. This restaurant wouldn't
serve us Guinness in a pitcher, and also
wouldn't let us have our burgers any way but
well done. And of course they couldn't serve
Carrie right. The restaurant's super power is
definitely not making the Cave Club members
happy.
