without having dirt fall into my eyes. It took us
nearly forty minutes of labor, but we finally
approached the lip. Kirk's next challenge was
to go over the lip with the rope loaded. He was
prepared for this by having an extra ascender
available to systematically unclip his ascending
gear from the rope below the obstacle to the
rope above the obstacle. In the meantime, I just
chilled out and caught my breath. Soon he was
off rope and I finished my ascent.
Overall, my ropewalker system did well.
However, the right foot cam was digging into
my ankle and causing much pain for most of
the ascent. I decided to use my frog system for
ascending the remainder of the pits. It took us
a good fifteen minutes to recover physically
from our laborious climb, at which time we
began hauling and coiling the rope. Again, Kirk
was prepared for such a task and rigged a pulley
system to make the hauling easier. Pam coiled
the rope as Kirk and I pulled the never-ending
rope up the drop. (Hint # 3 to trainees: hauling
ropes is much fun. You should always offer to
haul rope for the “older" members on the trip.)
With the rope coiled into two halves (so two
people can share in carrying the rope), we again
had to wait for Kirk to repack his pack.
Personally, it is my observation that Kirk is
getting slow is his old age and this is an excuse
to slow the young folk down a bit. So far we
had been in the cave for about six hours and we
were beginning to feel fatigued. Knowing that
we were leaving the cave and that the toughest
part of the trip was over, our spirits were lifted.
We ascended the nuisance drops and Warm-up
Pit. To make our lives easier, we hauled the
ropes up the drops instead of climbing with
them attached to our harnesses. It was still
laborious. Fifteen minutes later we exited the
cave into a warm but overcast night. I was
hoping the sky would be clear so we could take
advantage of the near full moon. It took Kirk
another fifteen minutes to repack his pack and
then we were on our way. Pam and I each
carried one coil of the long rope, so we were
attached on the way down the mountain. Forty-
five minutes later we were sitting at the car
drinking some cold beverages and reminiscing
about the experience. I know Kirk was
exhausted because he made not a single attempt
to scare Pam and I by jumping out from behind
a rock along the trail. We spent about nine
hours underground, plus another two hiking to
and from the cave. It was midnight by the time
we arrived back at camp. We were so lethargic
that we did not even want to drink a beer, so we
all went to bed early to get a good jump on
Saturday's festivities.
SATURDAY OCTOBER 6, 2001
. We woke up leisurely Saturday morning. We
contemplated bouncing a pit or two while we
ate our breakfast, but decided to hang out
around camp and enjoy the many activities.
Our aching bodies were still recovering from
the trip to Ellison's Cave. Instantly af
making that decision, I heard the pop-fizz of a
beer can being opened. Kirk was starting his
alcohol consumption early, possibly to make up
for lost time last night.
Throughout the day we revisited Vendor Row
several times. Ray convinced Nikky she needed
a flattering fleece halter top. This decision was
confirmed by most males in the vicinity. Nikky
and myself competed in the squeeze box and
rope running competitions. For our efforts,
Nikky won a carabiner for taking second place
in the women's ropewalker, second only to
Berta Kirchman. I also won a carabiner for
taking first in the men's mechanical sit-stand
(frogger). Berta ended up winning a 150 foot
rope. We occupied ourselves all afternoon by
playing poker. Kirk and Nikky cleaned house
and spent their winnings at Vendor Row. (Hint
# 4 to trainees: participate in the rope running
contests, you can will free gear!)
Bill Stringfellow invited all of us to a spaghetti
dinner with nearby cavers. Once again, I found
a free meal (see Hint # 1). After filling
ourselves with pasta, garlic bread, and “Death
by Chocolate” for desert, we meandered down
to the campfire area for the awards ceremony.
This is where we collected our prizes, tried to
win some door prizes, and recognized the hard
work and dedication of the many people who
organized this great weekend. The crowd of
1400 people got restless anticipating the
lighting of the bonfire as darkness fell upon us.
