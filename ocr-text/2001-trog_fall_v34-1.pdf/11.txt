Geographical Society of Paris. This position
required him to become more of a scientist, a
position that he accepted with enthusiasm but
was not as well qualified for as exploration. For
example, Martel frequently lectured on the
eccentric warnings that the earth was quickly
drying up due to all the ground water that
plummeted into the bowels of the earth. “Many
centuries will not elapse,” theorized Martel,
"before men will die of thirst and the earth
itself perish of dryness." To combat this
particular danger, Martel encouraged the
damming of rivers both above and below the
ground as well as planting trees to curve the
amount of water allowed to seep freely through
the earth.
Other scientific theories of his, however, had
more success and are still used to this day.
Perhaps his greatest scientific contribution was
for determining how subterranean water
circulates. This research was prompted by a
bout of ptomaine poisoning that he contracted
from spring water in 1892. After recovering, he
took fluorescein dye and put it into a nearby
stream sink. When the stream turned green he
descended the pit to find a decaying carcass of
a dead calf which he referred to as veal
bouillon. This research was again used while
determining the cause of typhoid in a large
Army garrison. After this success, the
government not only demanded that future
drinking water be tested by a geologist, a
chemist, and a microbiologist, but in 1902 a law
was also passed which prohibited the dumping
of trash and dead animals in chasms, potholes,
and underground streams. By 1908, the typhoid
epidemic in France had been cut by 50% and
the French government awarded him its gold
medal for epidemics.
Martel passed away in 1938 at 78 years of age
and definitely the world's first “old fart" caver.
While his actual scientific achievements are
few, he is remembered for his persistence and
dedication. From rigging to caving equipment
and survey technique, Martel was among the
first to treat the budding science of speleology
as a serious study and not something drugged
from the depths of classical mysticism and
superstition. Though the term caver – someone
who is just as dedicated to protecting the
underground environment as exploring it - had
not been developed, Martel is perhaps the
worlds first. Instead, the world at large
fashioned him a “spelunker.” And if taken in
that context, it is a term we should all feel
rather fondly toward.
So again, as I sat there smiling, contemplating
the best way to tactfully address the insult
which my father's friend had just made toward
me, I decided in the end the best response was
just to smile and say, “Yes I am and I'm proud
to be one."
