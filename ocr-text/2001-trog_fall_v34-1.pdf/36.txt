Grotto Grapevine

CAVERS AREN'T A8 LAZY AS YOU THOUGHT
Once again, Elvis Grotto. members prove
they're tough. Steve LePera, Philip Balister,
and Sandy Knapp biked in the Blacksburg Road
Race in July and not all of them came in dead
last. In September, Natalie Serbu, Kristen
(Posson) Chaddock, and Eileen O'Malley raced
in a Half Marathon in northern Virginia. They,
too, met their goal - finishing before the
awards ceremony began.
This summer Steve LePera, Steve Wells, and
Joe Thompson joined a crew to rappel and
climb El Capitan, a cliff of a mere 2600 feet.
Each rappelled a few times. The altitude got the
best of Joe on his climb, so he changed over
several hundred feet up and zoomed back
down. Wells and LePera began a knots climb
together, but poorly rigged gear and a deadline
for the climb convinced LePera to change over
almost halfway up.
Pete Sauvigne quit his job earlier this year in
favor of hiking the Appalachian Trail. He then
took a post-Christmas trip to Mexico to climb
the volcano Orizaba. His wife Linda is anxious
for him to get back to work, however. As she
put it, â€œIf he has a job then he can't keep going
away on long trips!"
AH, CLUB RELATIONSHIPS
Carl Bern and Amy Johnson tied the knot in
West Virginia. Despite a small flood, the post-
wedding camp-out was a rousing success. Matt
Stec and Stacy Graves got hitched in August,
followed by Bill Steier and Jen [maiden name
here]. After a ridiculously long courtship, Amy
Stirgwolt finally married Scott Jacobs and is
living in Connecticut. Kristen Posson married
Dan Chaddock over the summer and they have
recently purchased a townhouse in NOVA.

Perhaps it was that knots climb, but Steve
Wells got a bit too tired on his motorcycle ride
home from El Cap. The road went one way and
Steve went another, flipping the bike and
casting his gear along the median. The bike was
totalled, and his wrist didn't fare much better.
Steve's first coup in the recovery was when he
was able to hold a beer in the damaged hand.
