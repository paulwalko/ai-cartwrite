My Story of serious Leisure at Ellison's Cave
by Kirk Digby
For most of the summer, and certainly
throughout the month of September, Pam and
I had been looking forward to attending the
24th annual Tennessee-Alabama-Georgia
(TAG) Fall Cave-In. In short, it consists of an
approximately 100-acre campground camp out
attended by 1500 members of the National
Speleological Society and their guests. One of
the unique features of this event is the bonfire,
and not just any bonfire either. A notched and
stacked pyramid of timbers is built 40 feet or
higher, and filled with chunks of timber.
However, for me, the most compelling reason
to attend TAG Fall Cave-In is to go vertical
caving. Some of the deepest and most well
known vertical caves are in the approximate
area surrounding Chattanooga, TN, where
Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia come
together, known in caver speak as TAG. In
fact, the deepest in-cave rappel in the
continental U.S. is about an hour's drive from
the campground. This is where we hoped to go.
Ellison's Cave: the very name evokes a myriad
of feelings in me and in other cavers. Inside
Pigeon Mountain, in northeastern Georgia, the
cave presents a convoluted and contorted three
dimensional maze, with many vertical shafts. I
hoped to revisit the Balcony rig point in
Fantastic Pit, 510 feet above the floor. I had
done the rappel and ascent of this particular
drop over Thanksgiving weekend in 1998, and
I had mixed feelings as I recalled the
experience. I suspect that a large part of why I
enjoy a hobby that often brings me into a
vertically exposed environment is my
acrophobia. In the caves around Blacksburg,
the deepest rappel is around 200 feet, and, for
the most part, the pits are small enough in
diameter that a good light will allow you to see
not only most of the walls but also the floor.
Over the 12 years that I have been going
vertical caving almost every weekend, I have
learned to trust in my knowledge, teammates,
and my equipment. Even though I know that if
the rope failed on a drop here in Giles County
that I would croak, I almost never experience
the willies. On the rope halfway up Fantastic
pit, all one can usually see is the occasional dim
outline of a wall feature, your climbing partner
on rope above or below you, and the rope itself
fading up or down into blackness. It is this
unique mixture of an acrophobic and
claustrophobic experience that tends to make
me start to quietly freak out.
Of course, none of this was really on my mind
on the days leading up to Pam and my
departure for the Seqouyah Caverns
Campground near Cloudland, AL. Rather, my
thoughts were on schoolwork, equipment
maintenance, packing, and recruiting a sucker -
er, I mean, friend - to ride in our rather
cramped and over-packed four-wheeler to
share driving duties and gas costs. Chris
Hibschman, another longtime VPI Cave Club
member and a longtime friend, decided that he
could.
Thursday afternoon on 10/4/01 found me
leaving Blacksburg after attending
Careerscope. As we headed down the
interstate, I felt a sense of relief, but also, a bit
of trepidation; would I freak out on rope on
one of the big drops, or would I be able to hold
it together? Quashing my doubts, I focused on
the mundane tasks involved in hurtling down
the pavement at 125 m.p.h. We arrived at the
campground a few hours after dark, and
pitched camp in a hurry; I needed to get Chris
down to Vendor's Row. Set up at many caying
conventions (and others, for that matter),
Vendor's Row is an experience all by itself. You
can buy anything from miniature cyalume TM
earrings, to 1500 feet of continuously un-
spliced rope. I had to take Chris and convince
him to pick up the $10 worth of miscellaneous
items that he would need to convert his rope-
climbing system to a more speedy and efficient
system. Little did I know that I shouldn't have
bothered.
Also on Vendor's Row was a booth manned
(and womanned) by members of the
Southeastern Cave Conservancy. We needed to
stop here to get the all important directions and
