d
is a recent discovery not far from Ellison's
Cave. We were relieved to know we were the
first trip into Ellison's today; it would make
logistics difficult if many groups were
rappelling Fantastic Pit.
Meanwhile, Pam unloaded the car, including
Walt Pirie's 750-foot rope that he generously
loaned to us. Pam coiled the incredibly long
rope into two coils so it could be escorted
through the cave. Meanwhile, I began building
my ropewalker system with Kirk's guidance and
a few blank stares from other cayers in the
parking lot. It involved tying a few pieces of
webbing around my ankles, attaching a couple
of Petzl ascenders with quick links, and sizing
the bungee cord. In less than 30 minutes, I had
a working ropewalker.
IMPORTANT NOTE: I do not recommend
building an ascending system immediately prior
to a vertical trip, especially if you are not
familiar with it. It is always best to experiment
with your gear above ground before using it in
a cave, where many things can go wrong. I have
prior experience using a ropewalker and had
the equipment and knowledge necessary to
change to a frog system if needed.
So, we finally get our gear together and are
ready to go caving. Since I was feeling good on
the clear, crisp morning, I offered to carry the
entire 750 feet of rope. A fair estimate of rope
weight is 7 pounds per 100 feet. A simple
calculation in my head reveals that the rope
weighs about 50 pounds. (Hint # 2 to trainees:
carrying heavy ropes long distances is tiresome.
But, if you wish to make a good impression to
the â€œolder" members on the trip, offer to carry
it.) First we had to stop and sign the visitation
card required by the park rangers. They
monitor the amount of visitors to the cave.
Then we walked by Blue Hole and started the
long hike up the mountain. The path is a
shallow dirt trench that weaves through one
huge continuous patch of poison ivy. We
flushed out a few deer and turkeys along the
my strategy is the less amount of time the rope
is on my back, the better I will feel. I plunge
ahead and scramble up the mountain. Forty-
five minutes and several breaks later I arrived
exhausted at a cave entrance. I throw the rope
off my shoulders and wait for the others to
come. It turns out that this entrance is one of
four. Unfortunately, the entrance that provides
the easiest access to the part of the cave we
plan to visit is located another 100 feet up the
trail. So, I wearily threw the heavy rope over my
shoulders and hauled it up the trail to the
preferred entrance.
We took a minute to catch our breath
replenish some fluids before repacking our
cave packs. For some reason this took Kirk the
longest time to do. I tell him he is getting slow
in his old age. As we get loaded up with 1100
feet of rope and our cave packs, Kirk mentions
(i.e. makes a lame excuse) that he cannot carry
any rope because he fears taking a wrong turn
and does not want to haul the extra weight
around. Since Kirk was the only person on the
trip to have previously visited the cave, Pam
and I naively believed him. It turns out that the
first several hundred feet is linear stream trunk
passage with no possibility for a wrong turn.
D'oh!
The trunk passage leads to the 125-foot Warm-
up Pit. I find it very fascinating that people in
the TAG area consider a 125-foot pit, a "warm-
up." In SW Virginia, that would constitute a
very significant drop. We rigged the rope to
two of the dozen or so bolts drilled into the
surrounding walls with a self-equalizing rig. I
had the luxury of rappelling with 50 pounds of
rope hanging from my harness, which forced
me to engage another bar on my rappelling rack
to the rope.
Next, we approached the first of two nuisance
drops. The rope (which is permanently rigged)
was badly frayed, so we took a few minutes to
fix the rigging. While we did, I noticed a rope
hanging down from the ceiling on the far side
of the room. We believed this was the rope to
the Attic Area, where one can descend 586 feet
into Fantastic Pit. We were headed to the
Balcony Rig (only a 512-foot drop), and were
soon on our way. After rappelling the second
nuisance drop and climbing through a pinch,
way.
Pam's strategy for the long hike is to be slow
and steady, which is probably a good idea. On
the other hand, the rope is uncomfortably
digging into my neck and shoulders. Therefore,
The Tech Troglodyte, Fall '01.
