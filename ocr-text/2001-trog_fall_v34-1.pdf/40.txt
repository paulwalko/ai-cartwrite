Why Northern Cavers Cave Electric
by Sandra Ramsey
Kevin was the navigator for the cave trip, so I
trusted he would choose the best passage for
the circumstances. When he said we should do
the through trip, it would involve getting a
"little” wet. Lights should have went off by the
smirk he had – don't listen to Kevin - but he
During my time spent caving with the Boston
Grotto, I learned that the majority of these
cavers use electric headlamps for their main
source of light. This was a strange practice to
me coming from the VPI carbide grotto.
Knowing the warmth benefit of using a carbide
lamp, I was under the impression that the
colder caves of the north would almost require
the lamp's use. When I inquired why they didn't
use carbide, the chairman of the grotto, Steve
Stokowski, laughed and responded with, “just
cave with us once and you'll turn electric too."
The caves of New England can be classified as
small. When I say small, I mean these Yankees
get excited about going under a boulder and
call that “caving.” The caves tend to be both
short and tight. After you've been up north for
a while, you quickly learn the advantage we
have down here with all the decent caves so
close by. The lengths of most caves in New
England are generally smaller than our Links
cave. This makes it a hassle for most to fire up
a carbide lamp for the short period you are
actually in a cave.
Even though the caves up north are generally
short (and not comparable in quality to the
ones we have southwest Virginia), there are a
few decent sized ones if you venture into New
York. I am not talking about one recently
created by terrorist, either. The downside of
many of these caves is you usually have to plan
trips a month ahead because of travel time and
all the red tape you have to go through to get
into them.
However, Clarksville Cave is an exception to
traditional northern caves. It has large passage
and is decent in length. This causes it have
more traffic than Tawney's cave. I took a troop
of Boy Scouts there in January of **** and
wished I had a carbide lamp. The trip started
off with the traditional excessive speeding
ticket in New York; the officer didn't care that
we were off to support little scouts. I think it
was because my copilot Kevin Flannagan was
cursed.
We gathered the twelve scouts and scout
masters and headed into Clarksville. The trip
was going smoothly until the final stretch as the.
water started to get deeper. Keep in mind the
average cave temperature is around 45 degrees,
and it is January in upper state New York.
Finally came the duck under where you are
standing chest deep in frigid water and then
have to duck under a rock. Normally you can
do this without completely submerging, but
with all the scouts splashing it was basically
impossible. We were all entirely soaked, and
now comes the hard part – leaving the cave.
The cars were about a quarter of a mile away,
which seems longer because your outer layers
are freezing as your running. I think with the
wind chill factor it was probably below zero. As
you whipped off layers it froze mid-air and
landed frozen solid on the ground. That's hard
core northern caving for you.
On my main point, a second reason why
northern cavers prefer electric headlamps is
because the caves are also very tight. Carbide
assists would be frequent in the tight crawling
passage. When you get standing room it is a
miracle. This usually gives you time to crack
your back – if you're short enough. Then you
continue on your way through the tight
passage. Carbide is not as accessible to many
people as it is to our grotto, which makes
electric power more convenient.
The base line is that the people I talked to in
various grottos above the Mason Dixon Line
feel electric lamps are more practical for their
caves. Carbide lamps can take awhile to set up
and light. They also are high maintenance for
the short trips of those caves. Also, crawling
through a lot of tight spaces increases the risk
of burning yourself or your gear (maybe even
