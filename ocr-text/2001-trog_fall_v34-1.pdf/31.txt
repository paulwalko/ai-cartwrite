breakfast. An hour or two after the new year,
things started to wind down and we went back
to our hotel. I think the only reason mexicans
put roofs on their hotels is to give drunken
cavers someplace to go.

01/02/02 8OPIA, BOWEL STATUS: KEEP DRINKING, DON'T
STOP TO THINK
Yeah, so I didn't write this on the second but I
wanted to talk about the pit anyway. The hike
into ‘drinas last night was tough, and to top it
off we had no beer and no dinner. That was
rotten. Today is better. We had beer and
breakfast. Well, we had breakfast that wasn't
beer, and still got to drink beer. The pit (Sopia)
was great too. Weather topside sucked but the
caye was warm and much better. Climb out was
great too. I'm ready for ‘drinas.

01/04/02 11:36, IN XILITA AGAIN, BOWEL STATUS, FINE NOW
THANKS TO DRUGS, THIS MORNING WAS A "BLAST"
Been many days since this was updated, so lets
start back on the 1st. This was the day we were
going to sopia, but true to the style of this trip,
we got a late start. Our late start cost us the
cave that day. But we did have some fun
looking for the camp site by golandrinas. As we
we
started up the high class mexican highway to
the cave and camp sight, our car picked up a
strange parasite. Back in the states we would
call them kids, but the mexican kids seem to
have no fear about jumping onto a moving car
and riding it up a road that we in states would
call a 4 wheeling trip. These kids road all the
way up the hill with us, about a 45 min ride, the
seemed to lead us to the home of the guy who
ran the camp site. After some time, we came to
conclusion that we had to pay to camp and had
pay to drop the pit. This we did and to the camp
site we went, 15min down a slick wet hill. By
this point the day was shot the car slagged and
i was pissed. But on the up side, i got my first
look at the BIG pit, and holy shit, it was big pit.
So, after tents were pitched, Lepera, Chris,
Ekey, FeFe, Kevin and I rigged the pit. Kirk
and others rigged the other side. After this, it
was dinner time, and it did not take long to
realize that the other trip had been eating much
better than us. It took less time for us 3 amigios
to see that there were no plans for a group
dinner of our own. We did however eat, the
other group took pity on us and fed us. We
awoke the next morning and set out for sopia,
the first real pit bounce of the trip. In the small
town of Tomapotz we had breakfast, which
looking back was the start of my downward
bowel spiral. The food was really really good,
and after we ate we found a local kid who took
us to the caye. He took us there quite quickly,
in mexico the kids are hardcore, and kick all our
gringo butts. Next came a place to rig, there
were many rocks about with many bolt holes,
none of which any VPI person would rig to. So
in true VPI style we found a big ass rock an put
some friction wraps on it, and away we went.
The pit was very cool, neat stuff to play all
over. The climb out was with Chris, and my
was sucking ass, but i made it out alive. When i
got out i saw that the same kid who had showed
us the way was there again, hoping he could
carry something from us and make some more
money. As we were all sitting around waiting to
finish de-rigging, the kid was having a great
time making fun of jeff. Calling him an
astronaut because of his big down jacket. We
got off the mountian, in the dark wet cold that
had been with us since we had first went to the
campsite, and went to the same little place for
dinner. This was a bad idea i think, but the food
was good, but kevin would not know, he was in
the car with the shits. Just after he had climbed
out of the pit, he puked and had the squirts, but
we didn't get to see the proof, thanks to a pero.
So we drove home after a meal that was, if not
good for you, very tasty. My happiness was very
high because my bowels, which had been
bothering me since we got out of the pit, were
unleased in a very clean bathroom. (resumed

So back to camp we went, the other group had
gone, and sleep came to us all very quickly.
With the rising of the sun, came the rising of
my bowels. In fact, my bowels made a much
better showing than did the sun. This was very
upsetting to me, for this was the day we were to
do the big pit, and I felt like shit. I took some
pepto and tried to hold off the inevitable as
long as I could. When the time to go to the
bano did come, I tied a bandana to my face and
forged into the unknown. The experience was a
