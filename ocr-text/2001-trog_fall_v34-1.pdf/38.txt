Bill Stringfellow was also downsized from his
Georgia firm. Strangely, Bill never seemed too
upset about the loss. He's taking the
opportunity to visit old friends and new places.
VPI seems to be stealing WVACS cavers. First
Kristin Matak moved back to Blacksburg, then
Nick Ziegre moved into town. Nick still makes
regular weekend trips to his project caves in
West Virginia, though he claims he plans to
stay here more often to save money. We have
plenty of projects around here, Nick!
THIS CLUB 18 LOUSY WITH BABIES
Looks like Molly Lucier and Mike Newsome are
at it again. Molly is now about three months
pregnant, and Mike is already talking about
having three more kids. Pretty soon the Bat
Ranch will be with kids like it has always been
with cats – there are more hanging around than
you can keep track of.
Tim Pugh's wife Kelly has had another baby. It's
no surprise, given that Jim has spent so much
time on his back.
Hugh Beard and Karen Little had another.
Brenner, their new son, was born in early
September.
Brian Cruikshank has also been busy. His wife
Debbie gave birth to Callum Scott on October
1. Those who have seen how Brian used to live
on Spruce Run are concerned that the child will
get lost amongst the mess.
And finally, Paul Kirchman and Dabney
Hammer are expecting. Let's see, two kids, one
dog, a buncha chickens, some goats....
On a somber note, both of Paul's parents
passed away in November. Paul was relieved to
report that they both went peacefully.
IMPEACHMENT
A slight problem with academic probation
meant that Mike Cole was unable to continue as
the club's president. Hasty elections led to
Philip Balister becoming President, a decision
that most of us are sorely regretting. Hey,
wait... is that a leather jacket Mike Cole is
wearing?
ONE MORE....

Who's WORKING FOR LAWRENCE Now?
After purchasing some land and old buildings
in Christiansburg, Lawrence needs to make lots
of repairs before he can use or rent out the
space. What better cheap labor than cavers? At
last count, he was employing Scott Rapier,
Mike Horne, Kirk Digby, Pete Sauvigne, and
Travis Coad.
Laine Buckwalter is now working for a local
satellite dish company. She works the evening
shift, so she doesn't get to make the meetings
at the Ton or on campus very often. Maybe she
should talk to Lawrence....
CAVER FESTIVITIES
This summer Carol and Toe Zokaites finished
some patio work at their Christiansburg home.
To celebrate, they hosted a fine potluck party.
Tip to people who weren't there: when asked
which patio stonework you like best, say that
they're both great and you couldn't possibly
choose. This might help preserve peace at the
Zo house.
Zenah Orndorff completed her Ph.D. this
summer, and in celebration the Bat Ranch
hosted Zenahfest. The celebration included
frothy beverages, live music (Las Cucharachas
and Septipus), and latex body paint. Perhaps the
most spectacular sights were Wil's red-painted
ass (can you say baboon?) and the show that
Sandy Ramsey and her "friend” gave at the
campfire.
Linda and Pete Sauvigne hosted a holiday party
in mid December. The house was full of food,
drink, and festivity. Many cavers were most
impressed by Linda's Austin-Healey and the
stories that went with it.
Since Ed and Lynn Richardson have sold their
party house, Walt and Lynn Pirie hosted the
New Year's Party. All reports indicate it was a
great time, and that partiers were up until the
wee hours.
CONVENTION
Yeah, there was an NSS Convention in
Kentucky. Some VPI folks went, placed in
vertical contests, partied, caved, and had an all-
around good time. Most importantly, they
proved that VPI still kicks butt in the Medley
competition!
