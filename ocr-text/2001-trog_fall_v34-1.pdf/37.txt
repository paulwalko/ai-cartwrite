Blacksburg alone. Once back in town he had to
make several repairs. Some speculate that
Karen gets the Volvo in place of a ring....
LAND RUSH
Wil and Zenah Orndorff went in with Joe
Thompson to purchase land on Mt. Zion Road.
They plan to begin a caver commune, where
clothing is optional and everybody has a pet
redneck.
Ray Sira, however, has different plans. He
bought some property on Prices Fork Road
which comes with a private home and a slightly
scaled-down Playboy mansion. Nikky
LaBranche is so far the only bunny on the
premises, but give him time.
Ray's move prompted a great cayer shuffle.
Chris Garguilo and Chip Mullins moved into
his old place in Newport, Nick Zeigre moved
from the other Newport house to Guido's old
place. Mike3 Horne and Kristen Matak have
picked up a non-caver to fill the space.
To go along with the run-down trailer, Chris
and Chip have acquired a run-down dog. The
overweight, aging “damnation” came with
$30.00 and the hope that he'll die soon so they
can get a real dog.
Just a few months prior, Bill Balfour moved to
West Virginia. His rental house in Giles was
snapped up by Mike and Andrea Futrell.
Speaking of dogs, why is Aaron Thomas' dog so
darned weird?
MORE CAVER SHUFFLE
Amanda Stiles has moved back to Blacksburg
and is hunting for a job. She has shacked up
temporarily at the Wells household until, she
can find her own place. In other moving news,
Chris Rourke has moved back to Blacksburg -
except that he never really left, and he has no
place to live. He's staying at the rescue squad
until the rescue geeks can scrape together
enough money to buy him a cardboard box.
Andy Sabalowsky is still living in Oregon, but
is currently job-hunting. His company
downsized by 20%, and that was Andy. At last
report, he was still dating Skye. His friends
report that the happier he is, the less often they
hear from him so he must be doing well now.

Matt and Stacy try to have a quiet moment together. Too bad Craig
Ferguson was there with his ubiquitous camera!
On the other side of the spectrum, Sue Setzler
and Doug Bruce seem to be heading for a
divorce. Sue and Megan moved into their own
place over the summer. Despite sending her
daughter to school with no shoes, Sue says
they're doing fine on their own.
Speaking of the “D” word, are Philip Balister
and Sandy Knapp getting divorced or not? It
looked like they were going their separate ways
a year ago, but they keep dating and taking trips
together instead. The rest of us have given up
on guessing their next move.
Spot Rapier went beyond the call of duty by
flying to Texas to purchase a car for Karen
Everhardt. On her behalf he haggled with the
dealer, purchased the car, and drove it back to
