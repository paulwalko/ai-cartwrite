TAG 2001 and an Ellison's Cave Trip
(including 5 important hints for you to be successful trainee)
by Chris Hibshman
THURSDAY OCTOBER 4, 2001
This day started out like a normal school
weekday for myself, except that I was not
looking forward to my exam in Advanced
Thermodynamics at noon. My reward for
taking the exam was spending the weekend at
the 24th Annual TAG Fall Cave-In at Sequoyah
Caverns Campground near Valley Head,
Alabama. I have heard many stories from many
different cavers about this spectacular event
and I finally made it a priority to get there. (For
all you young trainees, TAG is an acronym for
Tennessee Alabama Georgia).
After defining fugacity and agonizing over
several complex equations of state for over an
hour, I finally made it home and packed a few
last things for the weekend trip. I drove to Pam
Mohr's house where I saw her SUV
overflowing with gear. Earlier in the week, I
gladly accepted Pam's offer of a ride to TAG
with her and Kirk Digby. Personally, I think
Kirk was more interested in having someone
else pay for the gas. Chi-ching!
We piled into the car settled in for the six hour
drive. We arrived at the campground by 9 p.m.,
but because we are in a different time zone,
everyone else thinks it is 8 p.m. We pay the $25
entrance fee at the registration booth and begin
to find a campsite. Bill Stringfellow, a VPI
member living in Atlanta, graciously invited us
to camp at his site. Lucky for us, he already had
a tarp set up upon our arrival, so all we had to
do was crack a couple of brewskies and set up
our tents. (Did I mention that we are in a dry
county?) To make a long story very short, I did
not bring any cool frothy beverages, but I took
advantage of the fact that Kirk filled my cooler
with plenty of it. (Hint #1 to trainees:
“mooching” is an art that is necessary for
survival at such events.)
Immediately after setting up our tents, we
headed off to Vendor's Row to shop for gear
and hunt for bargains. For those of you who
know Kirk, this is his favorite pasttime during
caving events. He cannot resist the temptation
of touching every piece of shiny metal and
tinkering with the gadgets. After talking to each
of the vendors for a few minutes, we went to
the Southeastern Cave Conservancy (SCC) tent.
There we met Andy Zellner, who is an
experienced TAG caver. He was happy to give
us directions to several nearby caves and pits.
Kirk, Pam, and myself decided to bounce
Fantastic Pit in Ellison's caye Friday morning.
Kirk was persistently nagging me to use a
ropewalker system for ascending this pit, so on
the way back to camp, he convinced me to fork
out $12 for some quick links and bungee cord.
Since he was loaning me a Simmon's Roller
chest harness, these few items enabled me to
transform my current frog system into a
ropewalker. We also found that Ray Sira and
Nikky LaBranche had arrived and set up camp
in the field near Mike, Molly, and Birch from
the Bat Ranch.
FRIDAY OCTOBER 5, 2001
We woke up early this morning to get a head
start on caving, fearing that if we started too
late there would be many people going to
Ellison's Cave. Why? Because Ellison's Cave
has the deepest free rappel in a cave in the
continental United States! The drop is called
Fantastic Pit, which is our target for the day. If
rigging from the Attic Area, the rappel is 586
feet. Another rig point is accessible at the
Balcony area that provides a mere 512-foot
rappel. In addition, there are several other
drops in the cave over 400 feet, plus several
So, after choking down some oatmeal and hot
tea on this brisk morning, we piled into the
slightly less full but more disorganized car and
drove an hour or so to Crockford-Pigeon
Mountain Wildlife Management Area near Blue
Hole. Blue Hole happens to be the resurgence
from Ellison's Cave near the parking area. As
we pulled into the parking area, we noticed two
other cars and several cavers milling about.
After talking with them, they inform us that
they are headed for Flowing Stone Cave, which
