To Test or Not to Test
by Pam Mohr
One day while practicing rope work at the
Quarry, I dropped a biner. I dropped it about
a lt about
10 feet and it landed on rock. “Well, there goes
$10," I thought. Being very frugal with money,
I really did not want to retire a biner I'd only
just purchased. Of course I should not have
dropped it: it should have been tied on, so that
it couldn't fall and be damaged. Even worse, it
could've hit someone – someone I liked.
So I learned the basics of not having any loose
gear on me while on a rope. But what about the
biner; is it safe to use or not? It really did not
fall that far, but did I want to bet my life on
"iffy" equipment? Caving and rope work is
dangerous and difficult enough.
So I decided to have the biner tested. I
remembered that at a get-together in the past,
Bob Simonds had offered to pull test any
equipment folks might have questions about. I
called him up at work and he said to bring the
biner right over. Kirk, of course, found another
retired biner lying around the house and we
brought it along as well.

A machine applies tension on the biner that is
increasing at a constant rate, and graphs both
the load applied and deformation of the tested
item. See the graph below.
Bob explained to us that if the biner had a flaw
or weakness, the graph would not be a smooth
constant sloping line, and that furthermore, the
second line on the graph (drawn as the testing
machine incrementally released load) would not
closely approximate the first (drawn as load
was applied). The only irregularities shown on
the curves are caused by the gate beginning to
load at approximately 500 pounds, which
caused the biner to stretch less per additional
pounds applied, and some small inconsistencies
at the beginning of the test caused by a bit of
slop in the test rig's attachment hardware.
The biner was tested to a load of 3,000 pounds,
way more than 10 times my weight. So I feel
sure that the biner is now safe for me to use.
