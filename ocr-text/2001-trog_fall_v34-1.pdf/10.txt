An Honorable Insult
by Aaron Thomas
“So I hear that you're one of those
spelunknikers.” The words burned in my ears
as I fought to push them from my mind. “Yeah,
I used to do a bit of that spelunkin myself when
I was a kid...."
Quickly becoming impossible to ignore, I
looked disapprovingly at my father's best
friend and decided that he, like so, many would
soon need a little lesson on the difference
between cayers and spelunkers. But as I sat
there smiling, contemplating the best way to
tactfully address the insult which had just been
unwittingly hurled at me, I realized that this
term was not always such a foul utterage and
that once many years it ago it had actually been
a badge of honor.
For while the term “spelunker” is annoying at
best, it clearly stems from the word speleology
and was named thus by the founder of our
craft, Edouard-Alfred Martel. Martel is perhaps
best remembered for the founding of modern
caving .- the implementation of proper
equipment, and utilization of standard
technique.
Like so many of us, Martel was not just some
jerk with a lamp who aimlessly dug around in
caves, but he was also a student, a scholar, and
even obtained high positions with various
societies dedicated to earth science. The son of
a lawyer and paleontologist, Martel's father had
wanted him to become an attorney. But soon
after completing his degree in Law, his passion
for caves became too powerful for him to
ignore and he was soon devoting as much time
as possible to cave exploration and the
development of caving techniques. The year
was 1883 when Martel began his legendary
career. After discovering his lawyer's high
collared shirt and bowlers hat did not stand up
well to the harsh underground environment, he
substituted a specially made pair of coveralls
which supported a myriad of pockets. These
pockets contained a whistle, six large candles,
magnesium wire, matches, flints and steel, a
hammer, two knives, a plumb line, 10 yards of
measuring tape, two thermometers, two
barometers, pencils, a compass, a notebook, a
first aide kit, several cakes of chocolate, and a
flask of rum. Most admirably, however, was the
personal 14-ounce telephone that he strapped
across his chest and used for communication
with his team waiting above ground. From this
long list of items, we can see many things that
we still require for any horizontal or vertical
trip and several items that are still required
during modern survey.
While Martel's version of cave survey and
rappelling differs from today's techniques, his
original innovations birthed many our own
current methods. For example, during survey to
measure the height of the deepest pits, Martel
would measure barometric pressure at the top
of the pit and compare it to that of the bottom.
For measuring the height of a specific chamber,
he would take a small paper balloon attached to
a small platform and a ball of silk twine. The
sponge on the platform would be soaked in
alcohol and lit, and as the balloon rose the
twine would unwind. Measuring the twine gave
him a fairly accurate measurement. When it
came to rappelling, Martel was often up against
what the English refer to as a “pot-hole."
Descending into these deep pits - sometimes
400 to 500 feet deep! - Martel relied up
rope ladder which could be lowered by his team
and lengths added to it as needed. As with its
wire counterpart of today, Martel realized that
a rope ladder was not adequate for life support
and also relied upon a rope belay from topside.
Though Martel continued to explore caves until
around 1914, he began shifting more and more
of his attention to “organizing and codifying
the infant science of speleology.” He had
already formed the French Societe de
Speleolgie by 1895. Interestingly enough, their
newsletter was titled “spelunca," of which
Martel himself was editor. It is not hard to
imagine that soon afterward those who
subscribed to this newsletter and followed in
the footsteps of Martel fashioned themselves
"spelunkers." By 1928, his achievements
