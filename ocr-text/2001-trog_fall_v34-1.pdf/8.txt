those of you who know Mike, you are aware of
his creativity with pyrotechnics. We were not
disappointed. Two rockets were fired up a wire
which ignited both fireworks and the large
stack of wood simultaneously, resulting in a
colorful shower of sparks and fire. The fire
continued to rage, with flames shooting fifty to
sixty feet into the crystal clear sky.
In addition to the enormous fire, individuals
set off fireworks and carbide bombs. I also
witnessed my first flaming hot air balloon. It
was awesome to watch the fireballs float over
the ridge of a nearby hill. I could only speculate
as to what the residents on the other side of the
ridge thought of the flying fire.... There was
also a coed Raman noodle wrestling contest
and various other activities.
SUNDAY OCTOBER 7, 2001
We woke up early to break camp and pack the
car. Then we all headed down to the pavilion
for a hot pancake breakfast. We paid only $5
for this fundraising event, and it was worth
every penny of it. (Hint #5 to trainees: it
wasn't free, but I did not have to make it and it
was delicious and filling.) Then we crammed
into the car and headed for Blacksburg.
I highly recommend this caying event to
anyone in the club. It was a great weekend
experience. Next year is the 25th anniversary of
TAG Fall Cave-In. It would be awesome for a
large group of VPI Cave Club folks to
participate. I am sure the bonfire will be bigger
than ever!
