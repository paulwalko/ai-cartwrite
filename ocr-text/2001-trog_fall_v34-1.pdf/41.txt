light your fellow cavers on fire).
Disclaimer: This article is not intended to bash
carbide lamp cavers. It is intended to educate
on more than one way to light the cave. There
are plenty advantages to using a carbide lamp.
For one, they can provide warmth at the top of
a drop while waiting for trainees to climb rope.
They are also good for cooking food. Other
benefits include cheap fuel, and they are
repairable under most circumstances (can fix if
falls down pit, cannot fix if ran over by Mack
truck). The flame also provides a nice broad
view light. It is possible to be both a carbide
and electric caver, depending on what is more
convenient for you at the time.
