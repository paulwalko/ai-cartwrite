dire need of a bano and we had made it clear to
him that he'd never live it down if he use the
pit for one. A little after he got off rope, word
came from the top that Kevin didn't end up
needing a bano at all. Instead he'd gone over to
a rock and yakked his guts out. Then a pero
came and ate the vomit. Apparently our
laughter could be heard clearly at the entrance
of the cave. The climb out was semi-sucky since
I was having problems with my walker. Like a
trainee I put my top ascender and roller right
into the lip and had to work like mad to get it
off and over to the cow tail. But I made it. Our
guide had returned by then and we all stood
around freezing, waiting for the rest of the trip
to get up rope. Our guide was especially cold,
so I gave him my fleece. He was still shivering
so I took Ekey's dump bottle and put a few
rocks and some water in it. The boy was very
amused when I lit it and tried to burn yeagle’s
eyebrows off. After that I gave him the bottle
to hold. We sat around joking (Chris got bored
and stopped to drink)
Damnit whoever wrote that, I stopped to think,
not drink. Anyway, that kid was hilarious. Ther
best thing: He looks at Jeff in his super large,
super puffy jacket with hood, and says
“Astronaute!”. We just about died laughing. He
even pantomined lighting a large bottle rocket
under Jeff and launching him to the “luna”.
Finally all the climbers got up and we derigged.
By that time it was dark and the trail was even
slicker so the way back was fraught with peril.
Once again I attempted to guard the honor of
gringokind by not being beaten by a 13 year
old. Somehow he sensed this and we ended up
sprinting up a hill. Eventually we dropped back
to a safer and saner speed, but I think he knew
he had me beat at that point. After we returned
to town he joined us briefly for dinner at the
restraunt where we had gotten breakfast. He
further amused us by comparing various
gringos to a santa claus decoration on the wall.
First yeagle, because of his red cheeks and
bright blue eyes, then Ekey because of his silly
hat, and then kirk, because he looks like a jolly
misformed dwarf.
The next day was ‘drinas day. I lagged in the
morning, letting John, Brian, Eric, and Brandall
get down rope before me. Mary came down
after me, and that was it for the pit bouncers.
No one else had the guts, or they had serious
medical problems with the guts they had. My
rappel was fucking awesome. I didn't exactly
zip down as fast as I did in Sopia, though I had
a few moments of excitement when I tried
dropping down to four bars. Will I ever learn?
Halfway down though, something frighted the
birds, and for a time I was surrounded by a
whirling cacophony. Anyway, I grabbed some
pictures at the bottom while I waited for the
climbers to get up rope. Finally, Mary and I
started up. It was a great climb. Mary had been
sick for a few days, so she really didn't have the
energy to fly up rope. I got to spend a pretty
enjoyable 1.5 hrs climbing, resting, and trying
to take pictures of myself with my belayed
camera. Then we broke camp real fast and
made a run for the soft beds and hot showers
of Xilitla.

TO BE NEAR SHITTERS MADE IN THE USA
Well Mexico is behind us now. We just got over
the border cross, all three cars were in the same
line, and all three cars were flagged to be
searched. Our car was stopped for all of 2 min
while we talked to a young guy who could not
give a shit about 3 young rescue squad people
who want to get back into the US. So he waved
us on, and we laughed as our friends got their
cars searched. I love mexico, i love being a US
rescue dork, and i love being the assholes of the
trip.
