blast, but afterwards I felt much better and
decided to do the pit, as if anything at this point
would really stop me. I am sure if it came to it,
I would have cut a hole in the ass of my pants
and done the pit if it was the only way. As I
rigged on my rack over the 1200 ft plus hole, I
had to ask if it was really worth doing this and
risking death. My answer came from the back
of my head with suprising speed and
assuredness; it said this kicks ass; do this. So I
did, and glad I am that I listened to that voice.
The bottom of the pit had a register and other
neat treasures in it. but I was very suprised to
see only 4 VPI people made it to the bottom of
the pit, one of them a tray-nee slug. The climb
out with this slug was fun, but not in any way
speedy, but that matters not. The overall
experience was well worth it. Next came the de-
rigging, a long dull process, followed by
breaking camp and making a run to xilita for a
hotel and food. With morning light came a site
for sore eyes, the sun! With our forgotten
friend warming our backs we headed off to the
birdhouse. Such a place defies an accurate
description, you can only visit to really believe
that such a place exists. After this, it was all
down hill. We went in search of a waterfall that
was never found, but on the up side, i got
shitfaced on the way. And when we finally
admitted defeat, we drove to Hotel Taninul,
and there till the wee hours in the morning,
Ekey, Chris, Deighan, to a lesser extent Jeff and
myself killed 30 or more beers in the warm
sulphur waters of the pool. You could not ask
for a better end to a mexico trip.

FED, CLEAN, WARM, AND HAPPY
What a wacky place. The lady from texas we
picked up wants a photo. Trip log is more
important. Texas picture lady take someone
else's picture. The birdhouse is a wonderful
place. Just imagine being stoned out of your
mind and then pouring a lot of concrete with a
lot of rebar. Then imagine letting it age about
50 years, and letting silly gringos climb on it.
Many sketchy elevated walkways that lead no
where. One in particular leads to a 20 foot tall
lotus flower that stands a few feet away from
the end of the walkway. As we venture closer to
the end of our trip, I feel it necessary to record
some of the funnier trends that have
developed. Here is a list of stupid things we
have come up with:
1) Chris's pants keep getting dirtyier than the
pants in his dirty clothes. So every day he will
throw his ‘dirty' pants into his laundry bag, and
pull out the pair he threw in there the day
before. When ever he spills something on
himself, he screams “but these are my clean
pants!”
2) We have now integrated two new words into
our vocabulary. Anything that can be reduced
in size without destroying it is “smurfed”.
Anything that spontaniously expands, but can
be smurfed is “slag”. Hence, we slag our gear
every time we throw it in the car without
packing it properly. Once the slag-u-lanche
covers the third passanger, we smurf the gear.
Is the car feeling smurfy today? I think not. The
slag is about to eat Chris in the back seat.
Luckily we have cervesa buried somewhere in
the slag, and all is good.
3) Note to self: Everything is funnier if you put
it with hola, burro, loco, cervesa and bano. For
instance: hola chica loco burro bano! (Hello
crazy bathroom donky girl) or Perro loco
cervesa bano! (Crazy dog beer bathroom). Time
to drive again...
4) <deleted>
5) So far we have met 5 gringos in Mexico (say
Meh E ko). They have all been cavers. Two of
them married mexican women. Hmm... Note to
self: avoid mexican shotgun wedding.
6) If you need to do CPR on someone of the
same sex, and there is no one of the oposite sex
there to do it for you, you are gay.
7) Eric loves stray dogs. Every time he sees
one, he says "good dog", but in spanish, so
randomly through out the day we hear Eric
cooing “bueno pero”.

Eric states that he is a sour sally and cows suck.
If he was a rabbit, he would have a huge pecker.
Eric has been drinking. (Eric isn't the only one.
