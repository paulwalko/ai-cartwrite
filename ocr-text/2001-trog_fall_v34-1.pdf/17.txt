access policies to a handful of caves. Once I
learned where we could go, I would figure out
where we would go. Up to this point, I wasn't
sure which deep drops, if any, we would visit
Andy Zellner, of the Dogwood City Grotto
(Atlanta's NSS branch) was extremely helpful.
He told us that if we planned to visit Ellison's
Cave early Friday morning, it would be unlikely
that any other groups would be there. Access is
controlled by the Georgia D.N.R., if I recall
correctly, and Andy informed us that we were
authorized to visit the cave. He also gave us
superb directions, both to Ellison's and to
many other caves around the area. I vowed to
return the favor when he came to visit Bâ€™burg,
which has its own reputation in the American
caving scene as a great place to visit.
Now the willies began to make themselves
heard, although I was careful to keep them
under wraps. I was going to be the trip leader;
I was the only one of the three of us that knew
how to get to the entrance from the parking
area, and I was the only one who had been to
the cave before. I was also, despite my
acrophobia, the team member with the most
deep drop experience by far. I had rappelled
Sotano de las Golondrinas, (approximately
1200 feet) in Mexico, the New River Gorge
Bridge (700ish feet), Surprise pit in Fern Cave
(another TAG area pit at 400 feet), and many
others, while Pam and Chris had only done a
few 200-foot drops. They would be looking to
me, and I hoped that I wouldn't start clucking
18
like a chicken at an inopportune moment.
The rest of the evening passed uneventfully, as
I drowned my fears with a couple of cheap
brews (Icehouse, I think), walking around the
campground and visiting old friends, some that
I hadn't seen in years. Friday morning came
swiftly, and at 7:30 a.m. local time (Central time
zone), we were headed to the cave. We
encountered another group of cavers at the
parking lot, which I was rather happy to find in
the first place, passing my first trip leader test
with flying colors. At first I thought that we
might have to find another cave to enjoy, since
they had gotten there first, and one generally
didn't want more than one rope down a large
drop, as that can often cause all kinds of
problems. But, as it turned out, they were
trying to find another cave in the Pigeon
Mountain Preserve, where Ellison's is located.
I gave them the directions that Andy had given
us for the cave they were looking for, and they
began to pack their toys, as we unloaded ours.
Packing for an expedition such as this can take
a while; today was no exception. The rope that
I had borrowed for our trip was about 750 feet
long, and was stuffed loosely in a bursting
Army duffel. If you have never handled PMI
caving rope (Pigeon Mountain Industries,
which, incidentally is named for all the vertical
drops in Ellison's), it handles almost like steel
cable. It is so stiff that you can stick the end
about a yard of it straight out in front of you.
Tough to coil, especially when there is so much
of it. The duffel would be much too unwieldy,
so we coiled the rope into two 375-foot coils,
and proceeded to pack our stuff. The other
group of cavers watched Chris and I rather
incredulously as I helped him to assemble his
climbing rig out of loose one and two meter
lengths of webbing. I took a moment to make
sure that Chris and Pam had all of the
equipment and emergency supplies they would
need for the trip, and nothing extra. Finally,
after about an hour, we were ready to hike
maybe two miles and 700 feet of vertical relief
up to the entrance to the cave.
We arrived at a cave entrance about 40 minutes
later, and Pam immediately plopped to the
ground, rather exhausted. In a failed effort to
slow Chris down, (5 years younger than me, and
more than 15 years younger than Pam), we had
asked if he would carry the 750-foot rope and
his gear up the hill, while I carried a 300-foot,
and Pam brought a 150-foot rope. I'm sure it
would've made a humorous picture. I looked at
the entrance, and it didn't exactly fit with what
I remembered, so I walked another maybe 50
feet up the hill where I found the cave entrance
that we wanted. Fortunately, I had been to the
cave before. You can enter through the lower
opening, but it makes for a much more
unpleasant trip; one that I didn't know the
directions for anyway.
1000 feet of walking passage got us to the 125-
foot drop, known as the Warm-up Pit. Chris
made quick work of rigging the rope in a rather
complicated load-sharing anchor between two
