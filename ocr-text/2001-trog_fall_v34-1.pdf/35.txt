station named “Loves". So you see “Loves
Gas" on the horizon. Chris loves gas. Chris also
likes the dark. Like some more dark? How
about some sun? Nope, right out of that. Can
order some in two weeks. Kermit is a frog and
an old transfer protocal. This town is so cheap
it doesn't even have a Dairy Queen. It has a
“Dairy King”. Stupid Texas. The border cross
was great. We sailed through while Kevin's car
got dismantled. Chris bought 5 liters of
Aguardente for 8$. I've never seen a jug this big
of something 70 proof. Mexicans make
everything better. Taxi? Taxi? Mexico has a taxi
service named “Maxi Taxi” I certainly wouldn't
ride in anything that starts with “Maxi”. Texans
love to play with dancing lights on their traffic
signs. Some of these signs look better than a
christmas tree at night. “Warning! Dancing
yellow lights ahead!” Sleepy...

STATUS: BORE FROM ALL THE EXERCISE IN MEXICO
Finally, my driving shift is over. I had the 2am
- 7am shift, but thankfully I got some sleep
before hand. I've had a bit of a tummy ache for
the last 18 or so hours, but its starting to get
better. Ekey seems pretty sick, he was close to
vomitting several times in the wee hours. Now
he's sleeping, and occasionally producing
hideous farts. It smells like Ekey tried to
smuggle a mexican accross the border in his
rectum and the mexican died.

Tus: LO, HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN
Well the trips almost over... we're just a few
hours out, driving through snow and rain, a
typical return to virginia. The drive back has
been fairly uneventful so far, though we just
had to detour around a wreck involving a jack
knifed tractor trailer. I hope Ekey doesn't kill
us all. On the intestinal front, I've finally
gotten mine. I blame the american food from
the Denny's we ate at in texas. Though
curiously enough, there was a strong smell of
sulfur at the time, not unlike the pool at
Taninul. Oh well, so go the mysteries of the
digestive track. Well if I don't get another entry
in, its been a fantastic trip. Oytfab
