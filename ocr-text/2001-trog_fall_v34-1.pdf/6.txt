we came to a room that ends in a dark abyss...
Fantastic Pit. But first we needed to crawl
about 15 feet on a ledge along the right wall.
Sounds scary, but the exposure is not too.
uncomfortable. I had to be careful not to drop
my pack! On the other side, we located another
ten bolts, four of which we chose to rig another
self-equalizing rig to.
A few minutes before Kirk is ready to descend,
his attitude changed drastically. All of a sudden
he started running around clucking like a
chicken. When I asked what was bothering him,
he informed me that he is afraid of heights,
especially drops over 200 feet! I have been
caving with him for over five years, including
many vertical trips in Virginia, but never knew
about his fear of heights. To his credit, he
overcomes his fear every time when he goes
vertical caving, and I respect that.
We pulled our gear together and decided to
carry only one pack to the bottom to eliminate
extra weight for the ascent. We also decided to
use whistle blasts instead of rope calls to
eliminate confusion on rope. You would not
believe how many echoes a noise makes in that
pit. Before descending, Kirk reminded us to
extinguish our carbide lamps while on rope and
to be extra cautious on the descent. Going too
fast can heat the rack to the point it liquefies
the rope sheath resulting in an out-of-control
rappel! This would qualify as an unpleasant
experience.
Ten minutes later, Pam and I heard the jingling
of metal at the bottom of the pit and eventually
the short “tweet” from a whistle - Kirk's signal
for “off-rope.” Pam rigged into the rope and
tried to lower herself over the ledge. After
struggling with the heavy rope for a couple of
minutes, she doubted that she had the arm
strength to feed the rope through her rack.
Reluctantly, she gave up and climbed back to
the top. Pam's decision not to rappel was a
good one because she was not totally
comfortable. This is an important lesson to all
of us.
I am the only person left to rappel and I too
found myself clucking like a chicken. This was
the deepest rappel that I had ever attempted; in
fact, it was my first drop over 200 feet. The
butterflies were flying around uncontrollably in
my stomach but I loved the rush. I clipped a
‘biner into a bolt as a safety. Pam assisted me
by hauling up the heavy rope to give me enough
slack to weave the rope through my rack. I
double checked and triple checked my rig,
making sure I did not zipper rig the rack and
that all biners were locked off. Then I weighted
the rope and leaned back over the dark abyss. I
could not even see Kirk's light at the bottom. I
nervously negotiated the lip of the drop, which
was not too difficult because there are
footholds in the wall, and away I went.
I started out with five bars because I didn't
want to go too fast. At first, it was slow going
and I needed to feed the rope through the rack.
This became tiresome on my right arm but I
took a short rest when I needed one. In
retrospect, I should have started with four bars
on my rack and added a fifth when I began to
pick up speed. However, my nerves had the
best of me and I continued to rappel with five
bars. Shortly thereafter, I was rappelling
smoothly and began to enjoy the ride. The shaft
was huge; I could barely see the walls with my
electric light. I can now see the dim glow of
Kirk's lamp far below.
Before long, my feet were back on solid ground
at the bottom of the pit. I unclipped myself
from the rope and let out a short blast on my
whistle to let Pam know I was off rope. The
first thing I noticed was a large pool of ankle
deep water. Upon investigation, I found two
salamanders and a skinny frog. We assume the
frog washed in with the stream water but we
will never know. The salamanders were unlike
any species that I have ever seen before. They
any species tha
were brownish and had obvious external gills. I
vaguely recall seeing similar species in pictures
in my NSS News.
Upon further exploration, we found a register
and both signed our names and a brief
comment. To relieve some tension from my
neryes, I wrote a joking comment to the effect
of “Uh-oh, forgot my ascending gear!” Before
long, we clipped into rope with our
ropewalkers and began the long upward ascent.
To save time, we climbed tandem; that is, both
of us climbed together, Kirk ahead of me. I
could not look upward for the entire ascent
