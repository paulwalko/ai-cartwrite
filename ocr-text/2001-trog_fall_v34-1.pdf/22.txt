What's Your Super Power?
by Nikky LaBranche
Everyone in the Cave Club has a super power,
and at dinner one night, the group decided to
try and take this from oral tradition and write
them down. Most members had their super
power bestowed upon them; they did not
choose it. And the intention was not to give
anyone special privileges, but rather to offend
everyone equally. For those of you that are new
to the Cave Club, or just haven't figured out
some of the people yet, this might (or might
not) be a good way to learn about them. I know
that I learned a lot and heard some interesting
stories in compiling this list from some of the
members.
Phillip Balister: has the ability to expand to
occupy the space available, much the same way
a noxious gas does. He also has the power of
time travel, which is why we haven't had a
meeting start on time since he took office.
Sandy Knapp: has the power to forget any
negative information.
Kevin Rock: has the power of being 'Clueless
Man.
Scott Rapier: has the power of having a Land
Cruiser that actually runs.
Andy Yeagle: has the super power of... what?
What? I don't know, I couldn't hear him.
Wil “the bastard” Orndorff: has the power to
know exactly the wrong thing to say in every
situation.
Dr. Zenah Orndorff: has the power of being
married to Wil the bastard, and that's all the
superpower she needs.
Dave Colatosti: has the power of time travel;
no matter when he leaves he will always arrive
an hour late.
John Deighan: has the power of being the bull
in the china closet. He also has the ability to do
the most caving in the least amount of clothing.
Kirk Digby: has the ability to acquire lots of
cave gear as well as the power to absorb any
insult. Kirk also possesses the ability to try to
sleep with anything, Also, vegetables are
kryptonite to him.
Mike? Horne: has the power of being ignored
when right, and the more right he is, the more
he is ignored.
Mark Eisenbies: has the power to hell-out
anybody and the ability to doubt Mike3's
powers.
Ray Sira: has the power of being well hung,
and women still don't want him.
Craig Ferguson: has the power of disco and
the power to summon Elvis.
Steve Wells: has the power of invincibility and
the ability to have no discrimination in who he
will sleep with. His kryptonite is a motorcycle
(which is why he needs the invincibility in the
first place).
Steve LePera: has the power of pure cynicism.
Chip Mullins: has a more nonspecific super
power, it's whatever power Sam lets him have.
Travis Coad: has the ability to throw great
parties that no one shows up to.
Nikky LaBranche: has the power of putting
up with Brad.
Carrie Blankenship: has the ability to never
get seryed correctly in a restaurant and the
power of not being a total blond.
Chris “Guido” Garguilo: has the power to
never be first, always second, and the inability
to focus or make a point.
Brad Atkinson: has the power of being gear
king (and some of it is still spotless). He also
has the power of testosterone poisoning and
the power of the most excuses.
Reggie Ried: has the power to take anything
rectally, especially when jumping out of trees.
Trudy Teeter: has the power to fit through a
coat hanger.
Nick Zeigre: has the ability to sleep with
anyone he wants to.
