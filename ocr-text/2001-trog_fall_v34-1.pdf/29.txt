THUNDERSTORM, FOREHCAST: CR1818 IMMINENT, RUN FOR
YOUR LIFE
This morning was no bueno. I woke to a full
out hurricane in my lower intestine. I tried to
vent it into the local bano, but the storm got
worse, and ended up taking the entire bano
with it. I was lucky to escape with my life, and
the bano was closed for the rest of the day. On
the bright side of things, I had a liquid
breakfast which seemed to calm things down a
little. As we were leaving a local taxi came into
the campsite, and the driver got out with a large
man and a rifle. Both were drinking cervesa.
What a great country.

which was an assault on the body, damn
mexican plants were out for blood. We decided
the path we had found was unpassable, we did
what we always do when it looks to dangerous
for us to go up, we sent deighan! After a long
time, he decided he found a path the was suited
for all up wimps. There was however a
problem, really pissed insects. Ekey, Chris,
Kirk and many other suffered their wrath. I
however told the bees to fuck off, so they left
me alone. We then played on the small drop
that was rigged, the day was salvaged by the fact
I got to “batman” up the drop. Chris and i then
exited the mountain, at the bottom we decided
we need to do something about the fact we
didn't carry the rope down the hill like we were
told to. So we did the next best thing. We went
to a small mexican bar and got beer. Which was
an adventure in and of itself. Now I sit here
with a buzz, and laugh at the fact that i am in
mexico with 2 of my best friends, drinking beer
and being silly! I love Mexico!!

BEFORE THE STORM
Fucking Bees. Fucking Sketchy down climb. I
was in the original group that trecked through
the killer bee's hive. I was the first to discover
the killer bees. They stung me in my eye. Then
myself, Pam, Deighan, and Keyin found
ourselves stranded above the hive. We had to
find another way down while avoiding the bees.
After taking all the stingers out of our various
wounds, we looked around for another
‘Deighan certified sketchy' way down. We
found it, but it involved some doubled up
webbing - short sleeve arm rappelling - tree and
rock avalanching crap, twice. Fucking Bees. I
hate bees. If another bee comes at me again,
I'm devoting my life to killing bees. On the
brighter side, this is my first entry in the log.
What a great place Mexico is. I've thrown
caution to the wind and eaten fresh vegatables
and drank the sketchy water at the hotel. Oh
well. If I get sick, at least I'm taking these two
others with me. We have a can opener that
talks. What a great idea. “Oh ho yeah; Time for
a beer!”

12/31/01 16:27 HEADING TO XILITA, BOWEL STATUS: BEEN A
HARD DAY
Sadly it looks like we lost some of the entries in
the log to a computer, so I will start at
yesterday. We spent the night at Wichwain,
drinking and dealing with a strange drunk
mexican. We drove to the Hotel Taninul, and
.on the way stopped to look for some good
mexican fire crackers. It would seem we did
well. We got some really cool looking bottle
rockets, they look like kind you see in cartoons,
big, short fuses, and really dangerous! From
there we went to the hotel, but they would not
let us check in till 2, so we had some time to
kill, we did this by going in the cave by the
hotel which had a bar in it. The cave, not the
hotel. When they lets us get the rooms, it was
to late to do the cave we had hoped to, Rio
Choy, but we decided to hike to it anyway to
swim and watch the bat flight after dark. The
hike was long but well worth it, clear blue
water, a rapid in the cave, and a rock to jump
off made the day a blast. We saw some bats fly
and called it a day. We spent the night drinking
by the pool, with the exception of the
adventure into the back of the hotel cave. The
smell of sulfur was strong, but the worst part
was the walls, alive with insects, thousands of
roaches call the cave home. Was we ventured to
the back, chris found the fact that roaches
crawling all over my bare feet the funniest thing
ever. We awoke all to early, and were off for the
day at Rio Choy. We got the pit rigged and on
my first rappel the rope touched the water, we
