faster with shorter rests, I wondered about my
choice. It's hard to relate in words just how
exhausting, daunting, and downright
uncomfortable it was for me to climb that drop.
Near the top, I was so whipped I must've
stopped for a rest about every 50 feet.
Eventually, I made it to the bolts, where Pam
was waiting for us. I got off rope, and went
over to lie on the ground, panting.
After Chris and I regained our breath (he was
much faster, of course), we derigged, and began
to head out of the cave. At this point, each one
of us was pretty much exhausted. I chose Pam
and Chris carefully for this particular trip
because I have been in a cave, or in the bush
with both of them before, and I know that they
have that will to continue when it seems that all
your energy is spent. At such a moment, one
cannot allow oneself the luxury of feeling tired,
or of rest. You have to slog it out and continue
out of the cave or up the hill, until you are
done. No prodding was needed. These two just
kept on. I could tell that they were suffering as
much as I was, by how quiet they were, and by
from the heat of friction, and it now was
covered in a sort of light tan, powdery rime-
dehydrated mud. As I rappelled slowly, I
continually tried to shine my rather powerful
halogen torch down attempting to discern
where the floor might be. Nothing could be
seen for the first six or seven minutes. Finally,
I could see my light reflecting off of a smallish
puddle, next to the bottom of the rope. As I got
closer to the bottom, I realized that this
“puddle” was really about 75 meters wide.
After I took shelter from the rocks under a near
ledge, I blew my whistle once to signal that all
was clear for the next person. I had briefed the
crew about rope communications on long
drops earlier that morning. Voice contact is
basically useless; the echo is so strong that a
sneeze sounds sort of like a very loud machine
gun. It had taken me 10-15 minutes to rappel
the drop. A while later I saw a very faint glow
overhead, but only because I had extinguished
my own lantern. Five minutes later, I was
joined by Chris. Pam had opted to wait and
experience a bit shorter rappel before tackling
one so big. Years ago, she had injured her hand,
and although it wasn't a problem usually, she
felt that it might not be strong enough to allow
her to maintain good speed control on her
rappel, due to the 40-50 pounds of rope weight.

Chris and I walked around the huge bottom of
the pit, and he asked me, "How much cave is
down here?” I replied “About three days
worth.” We spotted a live frog about six
centimeters in length, and a number of ten
centimeter salamanders with external gills in
the 75-foot "puddle,” as we walked over to sign
the cave register. Each of us wrote a comment
and signed in. Now it was time for the long
climb out. The rope and bolts are easily strong
enough for two, so we climbed out tandem, a
few feet apart, in order to save time. Having
someone weighting the rope below you can
make getting off rope at the top extremely
difficult, especially for the inexperienced, so I
opted to be on top. As we climbed I began to
realize that I could've probably allowed Chris
to use his original climbing rig, as long as the
bounce didn't make me puke. His original rig
was much more wasteful of energy, and
bouncy, but as he kept spurning me on to climb
Chris and I climbed the Warm-up Pit, and
before I had begun climbing, I had tied the 750-
foot rope on the end of the rope, so that he and
I could haul it up the drop. Damn it was heavy.
Even with the haul system that I had rigged to
the bolts, it was a lot of hard work hauling that
behemoth up. We toiled happily, however,
knowing that we were an easy walk to the
entrance. As a nice gesture, we hauled up Pam's
equipment as well, so that she could climb the
125 feet unfettered. She arrived spent, and
once she was safely away from the edge, Chris
and I derigged and coiled the last rope. As we
stumbled out of the cave and down the
mountain, I could barely contain my elation.
We had accomplished quite an achievement,
and the fish stories in camp would be merry and
boisterous tonight. At the car 30 minutes later,
the two beers I had before Chris and Pam
emerged from the woods were like ambrosia,
even if they did cost only $6.99 a case. As I
remember that cave trip, it's hard for me to
believe that something so fantastically
unpleasant, and seemingly foolish to so many
others, could be remembered by me so fondly.
