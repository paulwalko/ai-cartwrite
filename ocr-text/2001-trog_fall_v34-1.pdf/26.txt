El Tripo de los Tres Barrachos

abandoned cars. Maybe they have no tow
trucks. Maybe they leave them as a warning to
other motorists who would consider stopping.
Concentrating now. On the bright side, we're
about twenty miles from the interchange with
I-10. I have decided this is roughly the halfway
point. Soon we'll get some breakfast, and make
sleeping bastard drive. Eric says his brain spark
plugs are dirty. It took him awhile to get my
lesbian vampire joke. Ironic that erics sleepy
driving is keeping me scared awake.

Glory be, we have found the lumbar support
controls on the front seats. Now we can sleep
comfortably.

spelling and grammar adds to the “flavor" of

it's not my fault!

Fucking gear. Fucking avalanches. We've just
made our first gas stop. Now kirk wants me to
make a spreadsheet for the mileage. Anyway, its
all going fairly well so far. We may be the
women of this trip (We ran late.. really late),
but our car has 10x the electronic toys of any
other car and twice the fun. Though it was
better before ekey just burped up those onions.
But I'll persavere. .

tired. punchy. So very tired. Eric says his pussy
hurts, because the stupid time zone is making
the night longer. Also his back hurts. My back
hurts too. These seats were designed by a
sadistic, deformed dwarf.. Ekey, he sleeps
peacefully in the back on the bed he made out
of our gear. He sleeps with his head on my
soft.. soft pillow... Take pillow. Smother EKey
Then I sleep ood. Erics says his current state
of mind is better than being on drugs. He has
been eating mints to stay awake. Running low
on caffeine. Bladder under some tension. Road
keeps going, mostly straight, but you still
should stay awake if you are driver. Road
straight, convoy weaves slightly. Stupid time
zones. I want the sun to come back. Mississippi
is full of sewage ponds. And baptists. Must
think of more to write to stsay awake. ekey still
sleeps peacefully, dreaming his little dreams.
Die. Die. My speech is poor now. Kirk is
having trouble staying in his lane. Oh hoh ya,
time for a beer! Send money to mississippi so
they can buy rumble strips. And tow trucks. I
don't know what is wrong with mississippi and
alabama, but the roads are littered with

Last mile entry, (mile 80) clearly not correct. I
have now slept, but only about 1.5 hrs. Silly ass
sun that I once longed to see, now keeping me
awake. Ekey back at the wheel now, Chris
sleeping in the back, having no problem with
the sun. Terrain so very flat, nothing to look at,
except Ekey, and that makes me remember my
breakfast, greasy and full of gas. I stink. Don't
know why, belive it to be my nasty boots.
Roads seem to go strait for-ev-er. Just saw
pumping oil well, very neat. Landscape as
empty as my mind. End Transmission.

This state looks just like the last one. I think
this one is called “Texas”.

Ekey still at wheel, wanted to bitch about
Texas. This is what he said. How about some
flat? You like flat? Nice and level. How about
some mountians and hills? Minus the
mountians and hills!
