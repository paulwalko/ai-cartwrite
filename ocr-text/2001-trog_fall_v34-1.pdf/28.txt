elevator heads up. Maybe it goes all the way up
smoothly, maybe it jolts once or twice again. It
defintely jolts in the end when it stops at your
floor. I think the elevator operator derives alot
of pleasure from scaring gringos in this
manner. But you get to your floor safe and
sound, or at least close to your floor.. the
elevator always seems to stop about a foot low.
But in any case, the machinery for the elevator
is up there on the roof, along with the weird
drum washine machines for the linens. Oh, and
a maid, who didn't seem to care a bit that we
were on the roof. We grabbed some pictures
and descended back down. After packing up we
headed out of victoria. And thats all I can write
for now because this laptop is damn warm on
my lap.

to the Cafe Canton, a chinese/mexican
restraunt. We were crestfallen when we learned
they didn't serve beer. Said Ekey “Yo necessito
cervesa”. Understanding that we were prepared
to go elsewhere, the proprieter agreed to get us
beer. He sent someone out to the store for
three sixes of Modelo Especial and we stayed
The food was good and the beer was cold.
Afterward, the group went shopping for booze
while I went back to the hotel to tend to my
bowels. Soon everyone return with beer, limon,
vampiro (a hideous premixed tequila drink),
d two bottles of the dreaded aguardente.
Serious drinking commenced. The aguardente
is nearly unpalatable. The dumbest thing us
three amigos did was to finish a bottle of
vampiro in a couple of minutes. Ekey said we'd
just pass it around and who ever held it and
didn't drink was a pussy. Well, none of us were
pussies, but we felt less than good about that
fact by the time we were done proving it. Other
adventures from the
night included opening
the doors to the
elevator to stare down
the shaft, throwing the
bouncy ball into the
ceiling fan to watch it
ricochet, throwing
bottle caps into the
ceiling fan, throwing a
cravat into the ceiling
fan, and throwing beer
cans into the fan. Oh,
and I proved that even
in mexico, I can still
spill beer on Ekey's bed.
Finally we kicked
everyone out of the
room and went to bed.
Morning came all too
soon. We missed

Bees!! Run! Run! Run!
We came we saw, we

thing to admit defeat on
the first cave, but rather
than take it up the ass
from small insects with a bad attitude, we
decided to just do a very small drop. But lets
back up for a sec. We arrived at the cave, which
to my chargrin, was up on the side of a cliff.
After the inital ass rape of getting to the top, we

could feel worse. We
did manage to get up to the roof of the hotel
this morning. The view was great. The roof also
houses neat stuff like the elevator equipment.
Speaking of the elevator, it was great. It had a
