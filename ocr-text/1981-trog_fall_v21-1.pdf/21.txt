right angle turn, then continues upward while remaining tight,
for about 10 feet. The method had been perfected before, so I
had little real trouble with the F.B. itself (the tight right
angle turn), though if I hadn't known the method I may have never
made it. Following instructions, I crawled in on my left side,
one arm ahead, as my shoulder wedged through a slight depression
in the ceiling. This was getting my waist to the turn, after which
the turn and a change in passage demanded that I roll onto my back.
I continued this corkscrew manauver until I was finally on my right
side as my knees reached the right angle turn. It's one thing to
fit your body through a coat hanger at a party, and quite another
to pass through a hole in solid rock not:much larger.
That ended the tight part of this obstacle, now came the hard
part. For the next 10 feet the passage angled upwards, just bare-
ly body sized. I struggled upwards, head on my right arm as it
lay stretched out in front of me, left arm pinned to my side by
the ceiling, and heartily cursing Paul Penley, his ghost, and
caves in general. It took 10 minutes or so to travel that lousy
10 feet - sharp rock digging into bare skin and sticky mud on
the floor trying to prevent any movement. Using toes, hands and
elbows I struggled, clawed, and panted my way up the slope, inch
by inch.
No large rooms on the other side this time (or even tiny ones!),
but the crawlway opened up a fair amount, and there was one place
you could actually stand up, though there was not muchi room to
move once you did. But it was good to be through, and the return
trip would be easier, since it would at least be downhill.

After that there were, of course, more crawls, The next
one of note was a wide one, but with a very low ceiling. It
was maybe 40 or 50 feet long, but the middle 10 or 15 feet got
very tight. Even with my helmet off I couldn't turn my head
freely. With my lungs full I would be wedged between floor and
ceiling. In order to move I would have to completely exhale,
shove myself forward a foot or so, catch my breath, repeat...
One of the bummers was that the exertion combined with a lack of
breathing space caused some heavy breathing - and every exhal-
ation would raise a cloud of dust in front of my nose and into
my eyes. Every time I exhaled I had to shut my eyes. Finally
got through that - not far from our destination now. Another 50
feet or so of crawls and small alcoves and we'd be there.

The first group had already arrived at the big room which was
our destination, and were busy rigging the 2 cable ladders we'd
need to descend into the room. The rigging was time consuming,
so we waited, strung out in various alcoves between tight spots,
By this time we'd gotten rearranged so that I was almost last in
line. As one by one people descended the ladders the line moved
up. Some pretty tight spots between alcoves here, especially
one spot that had been a dig. I wedged through that slowly, inch
by inch as I lay on my back, I became very tired of having my
