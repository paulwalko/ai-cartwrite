CARTWRIGHT'S BIOGRAPHY - CHAPTER I
Aloysius Ignatz Cartwright was born at a very early age, and he was
so surprised to see the light of day that he was speechless for about two
years, Cartwright was one of the Neanderthal men (who were the original
speleos). He began his caving career in Europe, and about five hundred
years ago he went into a very large cave in Italy. He stayed in this cave
for many years, exploring the millions of miles of passages, going down
hundred-mile vertical drops, and following streams as big as the Mississippi
(when he tells lies they're really the big ones).
It was while he was in this cave that he began keeping a diary, so
after this part we won't have to trust just his memory. His diary starts in
1491, at which time he was several thousand miles from the entrance to the
cave, so he was greatly surprised to see daylight. When he came out of the
new entrance he had found he was at the entrance of Clover Hollow Cave
(which to our knowledge has no end). This was the way Cartwright discovered
America on February 29, 1491 (1491 wasn't a leap year, but Cartwright doesn't
know that).
Thus Cartwright beat Columbus by over a year, but he never bothered to
go back to Europe and tell people about America.

Special!
We hear that -- A. I. Cartwright even registered in a Physics class
last quarter and was doing pretty well but oweing to a rule of this college
limiting the number of absences he had to be dropped from the role. That's
a real caveman for you. -- When he can't even stay above ground long enough
to attend classes.
