July 30- New River
Don, Sue Heazel and I took a group into New River for seven hours. This
time I got lost and walked right into a dead end.
July 31- Smokehole
Ah, Friday! Don and I took another group into Smokehole for a wonder-
fully wet two hours.
September 12- McClung's Cave.
This weekend Koerschner, Bob Amundson and I were in West Virginia for
a trip in McClung's. Bill and I rushed Bob back to Third Breakdown in less
than two hours (it usually takes two hours to get to Second Breakdown). I
read Sunntos instead of Brunton and found it to be a pain to have to hold my
lamp in my hand all the time so I could see the numbers. We surveyed for six
hours and sixty-five stations, closing the biggest loop I'd ever seen. We
then completed our trip by going on out the other side of the loop. I enjoyed
it, but Bob seemed like he would have preferred th other way,
The first part of the passage was a bedrock crawl, which was rather long.
When we came out of the crawl we came into a highly fractured walk-crouch
passage. The walls here were so fractured that if you felt like it, you
could take chunks of rock out of the wall. This wonderful condition was caused
by the formation of gypsum crystals inside the rock. As the crystals grew they
shattered the rock into millions of pieces. Needles to say, we didn't touch
the walls much. I still don't quite understand why Bob didn't like it.
Well that is what caving I did this summer, except my two Roppel trips.
All in all I raked in 132 hours in 14 trips. This is just a sample of what can
be done during the summer. There are enough caves in the area that if you
have the time, (money, and car) you can go every weekend.
