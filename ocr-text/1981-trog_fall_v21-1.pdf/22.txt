body constricted, I just wanted to be able to move freely - the
hell with these tiny holes: I fought the anxiety back and contin-
ued inch by inch until I finally got my shoulders far enough to
be able to move my arms freely - at last!
Now there was only a chimney across a deep slot and a steep
slope to the first cable ladder, which was rigged through a mud-
ringed hole. You had to back out the hole with your legs hanging
in empty space, supporting yourself by your arms until you were
out far enough to place your feet on the rungs. This was only about
a 10 foot climb down into an alcove, which was high up in the wall
of a huge room. From the alcove there was a second ladder climb,
this one about 40 feet and muddy and sleazy, and then our destinat-
ion! By the time the last person descended the ladder around 6 PM
we had been in the cave around 7 hours, about 4 of that in crawls.
Ed laid out and unwrapped all the bundles, and with plenty of
help assembled the scaling pole as I took pictures. The pole was
an ingenious design, looking much like one of those radio towers
you see, supported by nothing but wires and hundreds of feet high,
It was built entirely of high strength aluminum angle, assembled
in a truss structure with bolts and wingnuts in just shortly over
an hour. Triangular in shape, about a foot and a half on a side,
and over 30 feet long, the gleaming structure looked totally out
of place in a muddy cave where nothing was bright. We all stood
back, impressed by not only the apparent strength of it (it had pre-
viously been tested to a 600 lb load), but by the fact that we
could have transported that through what we had just come through!
I could detect a bit of nervousness in Ed. as the time came
close for him to actually try it in its first real test. The cable
ladder, a belay rope, and some guy lines were attached to the up-
per end, and after much discussion the pole was raised into place,
with the top just under what appeared to be a large passage (com-
pared to the crawls we'd come through). Ed and Lawrence hung
from the ladder, testing, it seemed solid. Finally, Ed was ready
to go. Three belayers held everything steady, two on guy lines
off to the sides, and one belaying Ed as he climbed. He continued
to the top, paused for a few, and then crawled/climbed above the
ladder and into the passage. In a minute or so he happily reported
that the lead ended in a short distance, Happily, because if there
had been something up there he would have had to map it, and all he
wanted to really do was completely kill this section of cave so
he wouldn't have to come back there ever again!
Ed sat in the passage for a few minutes, gathering his nerve
for the climb back down. While waiting he kicked down a lot of
loose rock as we hid, since there had been a lot of falling rock
on the climb up. It was very strange, hearing the metallic twang
of rocks hitting aluminum back in that cave. Loose rocks cleared
away, Ed climbed back down to the top of the pole and back onto
the ladder, and then down. That was it for Ed! He wasn't going
back up that thing today, thankyou.
