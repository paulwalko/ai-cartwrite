One arm ahead of me, one behind, I lay on my side, the only way
I could fit, unable even to turn my head because of my hardhat.
After that I learned to shove my hat ahead of me, it was more gear
to shove, but the peace of mind I gained from having some freedom
of head movement was worth it. After Ed's lamp was relit we con-
tinued on, coming to the "end" of the first crawl about 75 féet
from the Bong Room. The "end" was merely an alcove that 3. or 4
(crowded) people could barely sit in. Of course the continuing
passage was more crawlway. The rest of the trip was all crawlway
with an occaisional alcove and a very rare tiny room now and then.
Bd had done a fantastic job of designing the scaling pole.
The gleaming, solid, 30 foot long truss structure was packed into
a mere 6 bundles, none longer than 3 feet, and a combined weight
of 55 pounds. The bundles were only 4 inches or so in diameter
and fairly easy to handle, but even so they slowed us down tre-
mendously. You'd have to shove the gear (packs, bundles, etc)
ahead of you to arm's lengthy, crawl ahead a foot or so, shove the
gear, crawl, ad nauseum.
In some passages a pack or bundle could be attached to an
ankle with a piece of sling and dragged behind. But you had to
be sure that the gear would not snag, or that there was someone
behind you to free it if it did.
Jozo and I were the largest people on the trip. Every one
kept telling me how much trouble I'd have at two notorious crawls
coming up: the Crimper and the Fender Bender, I was continually
reminded that Joe (who's about my size) made it only be "sheer
determination", that it was going to be rough, etc. Needless to
say, I was not filled with eager anticipation, but the inevitable
always happens, and so we arrived at the Crimper,
The crimper is an extremely narrow curved passage. I was told
that in order to make it I'd have to 'strip to my T-shirt and pants,
even my boots had to come off. They were right. I felt my chest
being squeezed front and back and I wedged myself through the vert-
ical slot on my right side. It was short, 6 or 8 feet, but curved.
My shoulders, then chest emerged into a tiny room. Someone behind
asked how I was doing. Ed replied, "He thinks he's through, he's
getting ready to find out that he's not." Huh? He was right.
The passage curves to the left, I was on my right side, knees do
no bend backwards. Finally, by spreading and bending my legs
frog-style I was able to drag them through. I lost a little skin
on the way, but all in all it hadn't been as bad as I'd been led
to believe. Feeling a little more optimistic I (we) continued on.
I was told that if I could make it through the Crimper I could do
the Fender Bender also, even if it was slightly tighter.
It was not long before I found out. Once again I had to
strip, but this time I could at least keep my boots on! The F.B.
is a small crawlwäy which gets very tight just as it makes a sharp
