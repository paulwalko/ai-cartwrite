The Shorten Seat
INTRODUCTION
This seat design is similar to that used by many, but it differs in
that it is fully adjustable in both the legs and waist. I have used a more
complex version for several years, and this design represents the culmina-
tion of many modifications, Its advantages and disadvantages are listed
below:
ADVANTAGES
--'The seat is held together with three perfectly flat, straight stitches,
There are no complex angles to measure or sideways stitch loads. Two of
these three stitches are backups only.
-'There is at least a two-way redundancy. Should the seat fail at the
waist strap or buckle, the wearer will still be secure in the leg loops,
A broken leg loop leaves the waist and alternate leg loop intact, and a
broken carabiner loop leaves the other still attached.
When assembled, the seat is as uncomplicated as a non-adjustable one,
-The adjusters serve only to adjust; they take no actual load. Should
they fail, the seat remains intact, although somewhat constricting Webbing
does not slip in these adjusters when woven through in triplicate, as in
this seat design.
-Only 11ft, of 2" webbing is required.
DISADVANTAGES
-The seat applies pressure to the insides of the thighs (points A,
figure 3). This is apparently common in this type of seat, but the pressure
is not extreme.
-This seat is slightly less compact than an all-sewn, non-adjustable
seat,
-The adjusters do not work well with thin seat belt- type 2" webbing;
the thicker type must be used. This increases both the bulk and the strength
of the harness.
-Greatest points of wear occur at the carabiner. 1.oops (points B, figure
3). These may be protected by sewing a backup piece of webbing to the in-
side of the loop, if desired.
CONSTRUCTION CF THE SEAT
The disassembled, sewn components of the seat are shown in figure 1.
Two pieces of webbing, one 74" long and the other 56"long, are folded over
133" from one end of each and sewn for a length of 4", leaving a " loop.
On the unlooped end of the short piece the buckle is attached with an
