· STARNES CAVE
My first trip into Starnes Caverns ( the historically correct name)
was several years ago. I had remarked in my logbook how huge the main trunk
passage was and what a neat cave it would be to map. Well, 3 years later
I'm doing just that.
It all started with Ed Divine taking a 20 foot scaling pole in and
scooping the upper waterfall lead. That trip mapped about 700 feet of dry
passage a level above the waterfall supply stream. It eventually came back
down into the stream and this is where my first survey with John Lohner as
sketch started. We went from there about halfway back to the falls before
exhaustion and cold sent us home, I read brunton and Walt Pirie was lead
tape.
The third trip in saw me in my permanent capacity as sketch with Ken
Bonenberger as brunton reader and Jim Jones as lead tape. We tied in the
stream passage from the falls to the end of the last survey trip and then
finished all upstream passage.
The fourth trip I took in John Lohner as brunton reader and Walt Pirie.
as lead tape, We ascended the falls and resurveyed the first nine stations
of John's sketch because of some discrepencies. A sport trip tailed us con-
sisting of Pete Sauvigne and five others. They had wanted to see the upper
passage before we derigged it. The entire section above the falls came to
about 1300 feet and almost none of it was virgin. A group of VPI cavers used
pitons to ascend the falls in 1958 and left one piton at the top as well as
their names.
When we finished, we then permanently derigged the falls because of
its potential danger to novices and started mapping out toward the entrance,
In the pool at the base of the falls we discovered an enormous bullfrog
peering at us. We surmised that he had washed in or hopped in and would
soon croak. We left him alone and mapped out into the main trunk passage
a ways and then turned left to where the water dumps down a 50 foot can-
yon. I had always wanted to get to the other side of the canyon but only
a nut would chimney across it. The only other way we found was to climb
the slope on the right and traverse across the top along the ceiling chan-
nel for about 60 feet. A blank wall in front and a slick 60° down-slope
on the left stopped us. I was peering around when I realized I was hearing
another stream separate from the known falls. Also, I could see where the
canyon appeared to continue. I vowed to return with suitable gear and see
where this new stream came from.
We returned to the main trunk and continued mapping. Halfway to the
entrance we turned into another left hand passage. Two leads choked in
breakdown and a third is where Vanishing Stream enters the cave. This lead
is low, wet, and muddy-the perfect lead! Two different tight places are
possibilities for future trips.
Once again in the main trunk we made it to the entrance, mapped to
the surface, and went home after 13 hours underground.
The fifth survey was more of a push trip than a mapping trip. John
Lohner as brunton reader and Jim Morrisett and Rich Neiser as lead tapes
accompanied me back to where I had heard the new stream, John had his bolt
I rom.
