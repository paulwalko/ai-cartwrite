We finally arrived at the North Subway and left the pole there.
We then went to derig the rope on a climb that Bill Stephens had
started at picnic. Ed cammed up the rope and cleaned the climb of all the
gear. We then pulle√• the rope back down and went back to the scaling pole.
We carried the pole to the leads we were going to check, and put it
together. We checked several leads which crapped out; finally we came to the
last lead. This was a two-step job. We had to prop it up once, climb up, and
raise it up again. At the top of the second pitch was a huge boulder that was
about to fall. We carefully raised the pole and placed it out from the
boulder on the wall. We moved it around to satisfy Ed, who was to climb up,
almost letting it fall on the boulder. Our hearts leaped as Ed and I grabbed
it so it wouldn't move. Ed got the nerve to climb up. Bill and I looked for
ways to get out of the boulder's path if it fell. The reason was we were 12
feet off the main floor in a four foot wide canyon, right in the potential
trajectory.
When Ed came back down he told us about a dome with a lead about 70
feet up the wall. He also told us that the boulder was just barely chocked.
We decided to call the boulder "God" because if it decided to fall it would
have killed us off, We pulled down the pole and left the lead for a future
trip.
After ten and a half hours caving we had proved that three men could do
a scaling pole trip and not kill themselves.
July 18 - Spring Hollow
Bill Koerschner, Robyn Lafon and I went to Spring Hollow Cave to log
rocks. We did this so Bill would have something else to do besides cave maps
to keep him from his thesis. We spent eight and a half hours following him
through the cave while he looked at the walls and drew funny looking symbols
in his notebook.
SUUSI
Every year toward the end of July there is a convention (at Radford
University) of Unitarian Universalists of all ages. It is called the South-
eastern Unitarian Universalist Summer Institute (SUUSI). The participants can
choose from many workshops and nature trips. Among the nature trips are a
vertical caving workshop, a vertical cave trip, and three horizontal trips.
Don Anderson has lead these trips for the past six years or so, and for the
last three I have helped him. The following are the ones we took this year:
July 28 - Clover Hollow
Don Anderson, Jerry Redder, Pete Bosch and myself took a host of others
from SUUSI into Clover Hollow. Jerry got us thoroughly lost and found again.
This is a great trust-building tactic.
July 29- Tawney's
Don, Fran Wistoff, myself and about 20 Unitarians descended opon
Tawney's for 2 hours. They enjoyed it, but I forgot something and went tennis
shoe caving.
