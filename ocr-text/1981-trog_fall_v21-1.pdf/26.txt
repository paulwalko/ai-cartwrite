ROPPEL CAVE
Central Kentucky has the largest known cave system in the world.
Mammoth-Flint Ridge is the best known cave in the area, but others exist
such as Roppel and Fisher Ridge caves, Due to the combined efforts of many.
different groups of people, these caves should all be connected within the
next ten years. One of these groups is the Central Kentucky Karst Coalition
(CKKC) which is mapping Roppel Cave.
The CKKC is perhaps one of the most receptive groups; it allows any
group to go caving in Roppel. One of the groups that has become involved with
mapping there is the VPI Cave Club. In the past year we've had three trips
there. Two of these trips I went on.
I found Roppel to be different than what I thought a 30 mile cave with
one' entrance would be like. I think that if you put all of Skydusky Hollow
together it would be twice as difficult as Roppel. :Other than a rather long
tight canyon passage (the S-Canyon) with a nice little drop in the middle,
and a long hands and knees 'crawl, this cave is pretty wimpy. I must say that
Roppel is a lot more fun because of its length. Because of its length it
requires endurance. Over-all, Roppel is like a sweet and sour Chinese dish:
it is both easy and hard.
June 12, Bill Koerschner and I left Blacksburg at noon for Nashville
where we were to pick up Ed Devine at the airport. We got Ed in the car, and
he drove us to Cave City, Kentucky, and on to the field house to get our-
selves some sleep before the trip the next day.
About two hours after we got to bed, Keith Ortiz and his Michigan crew
(they were mapping Fisher Ridge Cave) arrived. Bill saw it was Keith, and not
only kept him up all night telling him about goings on at VPI, but he ended
up sleeping on his glasses.
In the morning Bill molested a black snake that was crawling in the
rafters. By the time we were in our caving clothes, several people had arrived,
most of them were to work on a second entrance. We then headed out across
the field to the entrance. Three others were going along with us: Bill Walker,
who was active in opening up most of the cave, Dave Black, who has taken most
of the pictures in Roppel, and a Tennessee caver whose name we never learned.
After a quarter mile hike we reached the entrance.
Roppel has a vertical 30 foot manhole entrance which requires a ladder;
then there is a 70 foot pit. After that it flattens out as you go through the
S-Canyon. Out of the canyon you get to a hands and knees crawl called the
Hobbit Trail, which comes into the side of a nice big trunk passage called the
Arlee Way (it takes two hours to get there). After the Arlee Way you travel,
through miles of canyons, crawls, and a passage called the Lower Black River.
We left Walker's party back in Lower Black River and headed off towards our
lead.
Our lead was on the other side of a part of the cave called the B.W.O.B.
(Blue, White, Orange and Black). It was named because of the various different
colors in the passage: the walls, the deep clean pools of water, the mud, the
flowstone, and your knees. All through the BWOB you must either traverse deep
pools or wade thigh-deep in thick mud and water, all the time dodging formations.
