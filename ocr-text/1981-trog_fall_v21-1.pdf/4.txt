PRESIDENT'S COLUMN
Well, here we are, on our way into the
eighties, and the club lives on -- despite the
predictions of a few pessimists in years past.
This year's crop of new members has seemed
promising, even given the amount of time spent
on above ground activities by those members
who normally lead trainee...er, prospective
member trips. Instead, it seems that these
introductory trips are being lead by such hard-
cores as Bill Koerschner,
The above-ground activities are worth
mentioning, too. The efforts of Joe Zokaites,
Chuck Shorten and others (forgive me for not
recalling all the names) have resulted in a
new and improved back entrance to Pighole. A
The Phantom Werewolf
number of our associates made the first legal
rappel/ascend trip to the New River Gorge Bridge
on 17 October, Bridge Day. The Miller campaign,
a big profit-maker in years past, was given less attention this year --
to our detriment, unfortunately. Rather than $1500, we won only $500. The
club owes thanks to Carol Trexler, Philip Balister, Binnie Ballou, Rich
Neisser and others responsible for the points we had.
In general, I suppose club business proceeds as normal. If this column
seems unnecessary, don't blame me -- I only wrote it, I didn't edit it.
