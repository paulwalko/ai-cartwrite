FIRST IMPRESSIONS
A cave is a crypt,
So dark and so deep,
Only a chasm,
Beside a rock heep.
But enter within,
And you will see
Another kind
Of fantasy.
A world without laws
of up and of down,
Just cold and dark stone
For sky and for ground.
Skies that can cry
Without a cloud,
And trees that grow
From ceiling to ground,
Flowers that bloom
No life of their own,
Grow on the walls
Their beauty in stone.
Paths that go on
All angles and turns,
Giving no clues
To secrets it's earned.
No sunlight, no wind,
No stars or sound,
Just blackness and damp,
That knows no bounds.
A caye is a world
with mind of its own,
A rebel of norm.
Deep under the loam.
So enter within
Its awesome arcades,
But be forewarned,
You'll exit quite changed.
