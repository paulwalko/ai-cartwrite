Hole Hunting in Ellett Valley
12:15 P.M, November 10, 1981. Jim Washington and carrie Rouise were
about to begin an afternoon of locating and exploring "unusual holes".
Tireless and intrepid prospective Tech Cave Club members Jim and Garrie
had separately spent many hours in Derring Hall perusing the literature
on local caves, most notably Douglas's Caves of Virginia and had gained
considerable curiosity about the little known and, as far as they knew,
rarely visited caves in the area. Based upon the sketchy information in
that magnum opus, Garrie had pinppointed the locations of the published
caves in Ellett Valley on 7 minute topoes, and had persuaded Jim to as-
sist him in search and exploration that Tuesday.
As they left the sign-out sheet, prepared for all possibilities in-
cluding extreme disappointment, they reflected back on their last exped-
ition to old Mill Cave when Garrie had broken into unmapped passage in
the back:
"Think we'll find anything worthwhile 'in Old Mill?"
"I don't know; Garrie replied. By said time, our inquisitive trav-
elers had arrived at the top of Harding Avenue on the verge of the descent
into Ellett Valley.
"There's a cave over there," Jim remarked, pointing in the direction
of an apartment complex on the right.
: "Oh, yeah. Professor Davidson's number one. I looked for it a couple
of months ago and couldn't find it." Jim, who had earlier spoken with a
local. at Mr. Fooz about the cave, made the decision. The mudmobile, Jim's
babyshit-yellow '74 pinto, pulled into a parking space at the end of the
Windsor Hills Apartments parking lot. The trunk opened, and a single flash-
light was brought out. They didn't expect much from a "For the Record"
cave. Five minutes later, up a little path in the woods above the swing sets
Garrie found the cave.
"I told you it was here," Jim said. The entrance was about five feet
wide and a foot and a half high. Garrie went first,
"This flashlight doesn't work."
"Bang it once."
America's premier nerd cavers clambered on knees and elbows into the
beginning of Professor Davidson's number one.
"Watch out for the broken glass," Carrie said. Den feet in, the cave
opened up into easy walking passage, about five feet wide and seven feet
high. After about fifty feet, they decided to go back for helmets and lamps.
While retuning to the same place in the cave with proper equipment,
Garrie counted the the Wiedemann's bottles. Nine. Upon arriving, Jim
exclaimed, "Shit!"
"The bottles?"
"No, shit. Look." Garrie looked, and it soon dawned upon our intrepid
pair that they were standing in no other than the local teen weekend hang-
out.
"Shit." The main passage pinched out in another fifteen feet. Garrie
investigated a shit-laden crawl which also pinched out.
