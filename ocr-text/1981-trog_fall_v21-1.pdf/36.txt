Banes Spring -- The Most Vertical Cave in Virginia
.
The location of Skydusky Hollow in relation to Blacksburg has given
the area the reputation of being a center of VPI grotto activities. Of the
six caves comprising the system, four have been mapped to completion by up-
to-date standards and plans are in the making for the completion of the
survey.
Banes Spring Cave was initially explored by Earl Thierry and company,
as evident by the historic initials "E.T." scratched at one of the resting
spots following the gruelling entrance crawls. R.E. Whittemore furthered
Thierry's penetration into the cave by removing a few rocks and discovering
the main section of the cave consisting of parallel, joint controlled mazes
with little vertical change. Whitt produced a map in the early seventies of
about 1.5 miles of passage.
Following exploration consisted of an attempt to widen a crawl through
breakdown slabs using a hydraulic jack. Whether it worked or not, the pass-
age was limited beyond "the jack".
In 1980, Bill Stephens and a handful of willing laborers dug a bypass
around the downstream siphon and discovered a cave very much unlike the
main section. As the stream cut through the loose shale layer and hit clean
limestone, a receding waterfall formed a series of pits with depths varying
from 90 feet to 200 feet in the upstream direction. The most horizontal
cave in Skydusky quickly became the most vertical as successive trips went
in to explore the virgin pits. Bill Koerschner began mapping the upper
levels of the pits.
Last winter, a project was undertaken to map the main section of the
cave, Four crews operated productively and mapped over 5000 feet of passage
in one day (and almost froze our nads off upon exiting).
A recent trip consisting of Philip Balister, Bill Koerschner, Ben
Keller, John Mummery, and myself went in to answer the long awaited question
Did we have the biggest pit in Virginia? The intention was to plumb the big
pit, called Whistling Wells, and survey the lower levels where the stream
connects the bottoms of the pits.
Triple Wells, in Newberrys, has the acclaimed deepest pit in Virginia
at 204 feet. That is from the top of the dome. Now, from the lip of
Whistling Wells the drop was measured at 195 feet. The rig point is ten feet
higher than the lip and the top of the dome is probably fifteen feet higher.
So, Whistling Wells isn't the deepest with respect to rappel distance but
depending on how you compare, one can say that Whistling Wells is the biga
gest pit in Virginia.
The series of pits are (from downstream to upstream): Pete's Pit at
90 feet, Secret Pit at 140 feet, Premonition Pit at 160 feet, Clatter Pit
(unexplored), Whistling Wells at 195 feet, and Waterfall pit (unexplored).
The survey project nears completion with 2.7 miles of passage.
