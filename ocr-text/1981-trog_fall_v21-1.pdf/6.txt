the most feared piece of literature since Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority

GROT TO GRAPEVINE
Alot has happened in the grotto since we talked to you last. Last
spring the long rope committee organized a 1100 ft. tyrolean across the New
River at McCoy rapids.
Picnic last spring was again held on Buddy Penley's farm, where Buday
showed off his "A Model". Two pigs were barbequed in an open pit, and quickly
consumed. Knox Ward made an unorthodox entrance by parachuting into the
picnic area, almost landing in the barbeque pit in the process. The great
frisbee fly ensued, followed by the cowshit-covered-frisbee fly.
Float Trip saw the usual flotilla of VPI cavers in rafts of all sorts,
only to receive high level bombing of ketchup and chocolate syrup from a
bridge by Bill Stringfellow.
Spring project was fence building at Newcastle Murder Hole where the
Beer Fairy was born and two kegs consumed. Little wonder why no one went
caving the next day.
Banquet was at Squires with the party at the VFW Hall in Radford.
Many out-of-town guests showed up-Jim Denton hitchhiked in from Oregon,
Mike and Suzanne Frame arrived from Alaska, Fran Wistoff and Dave Shantz
both won purple heart awards for injuries suffered in the line of duty-
can collecting.
VPI hosted the spring VAR at the McCoy campground, and the election
question of the year was answered: Who is Evelyn Bradshaw? A feast of
barbequed chicken was followed by a party in the rafters of the picnic shel-
ter.
Members of the grotto led caving trips to Newberry's, Buddy's, New
River, and Fool's Face to a gathering of VCOAEBFD members. In addition to
some caving instruction, Jerry Redder showed them how to eat a spider,
Much activity went on during the summer. Chuck Shorten finished map-
ping Pig Hole, and Bill Koerschner brought the length of Spring Hollow over
5 miles. Lawrence Britt and John Lohner started mapping Starnes Cave,
There were several moonlight swims in Mountain Lake, and John Lohner tried
to wash his '72 Caprice dinosaur in the New River (it took 60 feet of Gold-
line and a case of beer to pull the car out). Richard and Pat Cobb tied
the knot in August, and made the "marriage swing" popular. Their wedding
cake was aptly decorated with A. I. Cartwright clutching a bride and groom
in his hand.
party
Russ Peterson had a successful August even though there was an aborted
Rocky Horror Show. Pete Sauvigne's annual 4th of July party was as good as
ever with skyrockets and a large flaming "4" in the yard. Sadly, Glen Davis
and company were forced to move out of the Main Street house, which was re-
modelled and an asphalt backyard was installed.
The grotto had much success in the Speleo-Olympics at OTR this year.
Pete Sauvigne won 2nd prize in the overall. Chuck Shorten won the P.RP and
