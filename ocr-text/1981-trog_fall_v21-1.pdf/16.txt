overlap of 5". This stitch takes a fair an
mount of the load, 80 stitch accordingly.
On the unlooped end of the long piece, roll
a short overlap and stitch. This serves as
a stopper to keep the waist strap from sli-
ding through the buckle when the seat is
slack, or folded up.

Assembly of the seat begins as in fig
ure 2, (Ladies: please note that you are
well represented in these illustrations!)
First, slide the adjusters on to both halve a
of the seat as shown. With the buckle on
the left hip, pass the looped end first in
front, then around the back of the leg.
Do the same with the other piece.
Next, pass the two loops through their
respective adjusters and set to the desir-
ed length (figure 3). The loop stitches
will be behind the adjusters, and the ad-
juster-webbing combination should be quite
snug and non-sliding. Bring the waist strap
behind the back and through the buckle,
Attach a carabiner and start adjusting the
leg loops, It will seem awkward at first,
but by snugging one side to generate slack
at the other, the fit can be custom-made,

LOCKING CARABINER
(STUBAT
When rigging for a shoulder cam, the
cheek straps shown in figure 4 prevent the
waist strap from riding up. Because the
adjusters are placed in the front of the
pelvis, this is a necessary piece, 9/16"
tubular webbing is adequate here; the idea
is to position the load, not bear item

SOME NOTES ABOUT STITCHING
Four patterns commonly observed on.
caver's stitched harnesses are shown in
figure 5. Patterns A and B are not as good
as those in C and D because there is stito
ching running perpendicular to the load.
When this happens the stitches are unevenly
loaded and the full benefit across the
length of the stitched piece is not realized.
Conversely, stitches placed parallel to the
load all contribute evenly to the strength
of the piece. Incidently, the pattern shown:
in D is used by parachute harness makers,
