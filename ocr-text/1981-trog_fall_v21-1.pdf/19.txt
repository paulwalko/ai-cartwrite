Pole - ish Caving in Paul's
Nine suckers in all were recruited for the Paul Penley's '
Scaling Pole-Photo Trip (I was to be the photo part). There was
of course, Ed Devine (designer and builder of the incredible
'Didly Pole'), also Win, Jozo, Lawrence, Fran, Sue, Rich Neiser,
Dave Mangus, and myself. Jozo, Lawrence, Dave and Rich were
first into the entrance, to rig a cable ladder at the Big Room
drop. The rest of us followed about 15 minutes later, entering
the cave around 11 AM and leaving behind an uncommonly beautiful
January day - sunny, high predicted in the 60's,
A damp mud entrance hidden under a boulder was the usual
welcome to Paul's, followed by alternating walking-crawling-
tight squeeze passage, and today was no different, except it
felt worse leaving that beautiful day behind. The passage at
the beginning was well traveled, and we proceeded through the
Breakdown Connection, following the stream down the breakdown
pile. The dry year had reduced water levels some, and it was
easier going in to stay dry than usual, but still unpleasant,
especially at one point. Passing through the connection is mostly
crawling/climbing down through a large boulder pile, and you wonder
what would happen if just one of those boulders were to shift...
Jozo almost found out one time, As he was coming back up through
one small hole he grabbed a boulder above him... and felt if shift!
Ever since then we've all been glad to get past that boulder, and
no one uses it for a hand hold any more!
Once past the connection we entered booming trunk passage,
very uncharacteristic of Paul's, and followed that to a huge mud
and boulder filled room. At the lower part of the room was about
a 20 foot ladder climb down to a lower level. The first party
was descending as we arrived. I went down the ladder next to
photograph people on the ladder, after which the rest of the first
group came down and continued on their way.
The rest of my group descended, after which we did a few
climbs and crawls and arrived at the Bong Room. It wasn't very
big as rooms go, most places I couldn't stand straight, but it
was huge compared to what was coming. We were a little over 2
hours into the cave. After enjoying the relative spaciousness
for a few minutes we entered the Jozo crawls, a series of insane
crawlways we were to follow for the next 4 hours. They're not
even respectable crawlways really, more like capillary tubes in
rock.
I was second in line in our group, behind Ed. Almost immed-
iately the crawl got tight. Ed's lamp went out, and since the
passage was too tight to do anything about it, he had to crawl on
in darkness for a while. While waiting for Ed to get his lamp lit
in a larger area, I found myself in the tight spot, and waiting.
