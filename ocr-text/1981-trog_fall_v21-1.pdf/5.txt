Many people thought that I was
crazy, or at least masochistic when I
volunteered for Trog editor at the be-
ginning of this quarter. I heard horror
stories of how much of a pain in the
butt this job would be; trying to get
articles, artwork and other contribut-
ing paraphernalia from members. Look-
ing back on that (while sitting here
trying to meet a deadline and watching
the typist accidently knocking over his
spit cup with the typewriter carriage)
I have realized they were correct. How-
ever, I have enjoyed this job and don't
regret it. My three goals this quarter
were to cave my ass off, graduate, and
produce a Fall Trog. So far I've only produced a Trog.
I would highly recommend to anyone in the club to get involved with
the Trog at least once in their time with the club. One of the important
things to keep the club active is passing along to new members caving
experiences and techniques, as well as a reputation for hard core partying.
Trog articles are one way of doing this.
I'm done squacking... read on and enjoy.
