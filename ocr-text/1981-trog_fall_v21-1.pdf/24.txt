still beat, but the nap had refreshed me a little bit. The
most of the hour we'd waited was the time it had taken them to
derig the short cable ladder - they were nearly zombies. It
was around 3 AM by now, and I couldn't even bear to think about
what we had to go through yet to get out. We forced our minds
to just think about the immediate task at hand, and not ahead
to what was yet to come.
Crawl by crawl, they went grimly by. Then we were through
the · Fender Bender, more crawls, a tense time for me at the Crimper,
moving on again. When we finally reached the Bong Room we felt
almost as good as if we reached the entrance - we were out of the
Jozo crawls! But nothing about Paul's is easy for long, and we
soon realized that, especially in our exhausted conditions, it
was still a long way to the entrance.
Some climbs, some crawls, we arrived at the ladder in the
Big Room. Climbing and derigging were slow, then the long walking
passage in booming trunk, a sigh of relief at being past the
loose boulder in the Breakdown Connection; it all began to merge
more and more into a blurry haze. More traveling, and at long,
long last, looking up to see light that did not come from a car-
bide lamp!
Climbing up that muddy .hole and out from under that boulder
was just as good as being in heaven - we emerged at 7:15 AM, after
over 20 hours in the cave! We went from depressed exhaustion to
sheer joy at being out of that God-forsaken hole in the ground!
It was about 20°, and we could see the sun on the mountain tops
across the valley, promising another beautiful day like the one
we'd already missed.
Itis strange how the elation you feel after a trip like that
almost makes it worth what you've gone through. With the camera
on self-timer we got a couple of group shots before rapidly
changing clothes in the brisk early morning cold. The beer I'd
brought along was well received - and in all of our tiredness we
felt so good. Well, maybe except for Ed. When Ed took this cave
on three years ago it was thought that there was only about a year
of mapping needed to finish it. The cave was huge beyond all ex-
pectations, and every time Ed has thought he was done, an: "insig-
nificant"little hole has led to another mile or so of cave. Having
to come all the way from D.C. now, Ed just wants to be able to fin-
ish the cave, so he can move on to other things. And while the
rest of us could go back to Blacksburg and bed, Ed still had to be
back in D.C. by the following morning.
Finally and happily arriving home I soaked in a long hot .
shower and then collapsed in bed. I awoke just in time to see
the sunset, tried to get myself together, gave up, and went back
to bed. Awoke to find Monday morning, and the whole weekend would
have seemed unreal if it hadn't been for the aches and pains that
were still there.
