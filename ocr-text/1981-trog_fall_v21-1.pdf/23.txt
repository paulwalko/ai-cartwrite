There was one more lead down in the big room that needed to
be checked, a channel in the ceiling. Win volunteered to check
it out, and was on his way up after we repositioned the pole..At
the top of the pole there was still about a 5 or 10 foot chimney
through a narrow slot to the passage we could see above it. The
only belay either Ed or Win had was through a biner at the top of
the pole, and any time they were above the pole they were also above
their belay. We all held our breaths as Win chimneyed, until
someone brightly reminded Win that "a broken bone this far back
would be fatal" (no names, but he hates to be called Larry). Some
very unkind remarks were directed at this person, not the least of
which came from Win! - and he quickly shut up.

Finally, Win made it into the passage above. "It goes!" he
called down, and left to follow it. After what seemed like a long
time we heard him return. The passage went about 150 feet and
then ended - did Ed want to map it? ''Hell No!" The climb down
seemed even harier than the climb up, and everyone felt relieved
when Win finally joined us on solid mud again.
It was now around midnite, and people were getting ragged out.
There was one more scaling pole lead to be checked, but it was high
up in the ceiling of the alcove we'd climbed down from, and the
pole would have to be partially disassembled to get it up there,
It was decided to just get the pole up into the alcove, and then
leave it there for the next trip to check the lead out. It was
after 1 AM by the time the pole had been hoisted into the alcove
in 2 sections, and Fran, Lawrence, Dave and Jozo started heading
out. Sue was already up in the alcove with me as the others left,
and we belayed Win, Ed and Rich up the ladder and derigged the 40
foot ladder. As the cable ladders and ropes were being coiled I
belayed Sue up the 10 foot ladder and then followed. There were
some tight spots ahead that I just wanted to have behind me, esa
pecially the "dig", besides which I knew I'd not get through
them quickly. In order to speed the trip out Sue and I started off
as the other three were coming up the second ladder. At this
point we were all exhausted, and still faced with all that nasty
crawling before we could rest. We just wanted to be able to go
to sleep.
Sue and I finally made it through the dig and other tight
spots and arrived at the alcove before the long, wide, "breath
out" crawl. Sue of course had no trouble, even at the dig, and
I gave her hell for having it so easy. Thinking Win, Ed and
Rich would be along shortly we waited ... and waited. We grew
tireder, and sleepier, not to mention chilly. We finally lay.
down in the passage, on our sides and back-to-back to conserve
heat. My carbide lamp supplied some heat to my front, but the
floor on my side was like a vacuum, sucking heat out of me. Never
the less we both drifted in and out of light sleep,
When we finally heard the others coming, we were amazed to
find we'd been waiting for over an hour. Ed, Win and Rich were
so tired their efficiency was practically non-existent. I was
