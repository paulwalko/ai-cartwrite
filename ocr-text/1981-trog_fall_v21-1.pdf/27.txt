The mud is so thick that it eats boots; imagine yourself thrashing around
in thigh-deep water trying to get your boot out of the mud and falling face
first into the water and you can feel the frustration of going through there.
Another part of the BWOB called Muckwater Canyon has deep footprints
in the sand where people have stepped. You can't see the holes because they
are full of loose sand which kindly allows your foot in so it can flow into
your boots,
Finally after eight hours of travel we reached our lead. It was a nice
wide tube that was constantly changing character. It seemed to take hours to
survey what they explored, but we got into a tall 4 foot wide canyon. At one
point while looking up I noticed a high lead, just what I was looking for,
a nice black hole that was easy to climb into, We surveyed up and I climbed
into a huge trunk passage. We diddled around hooting and hollering for a while
and then got down to the task of surveying it. I took a couple shots up one
way, and then back the other way because it was heading away from known cave.
After a while we all started feeling the hours and burning out. I would
forget to tell Ed when the lamp was on station, and he would read off of it
while I was marking the station. Bill was really getting burned out because
of the passage size. I stopped our surveying at a large boulder just before
the passage turned and thousands of leads came in at the same place. Ed went
exploring while we ate, and when we had finished, we explored also.
After the major junction we avoided surveying, the passage got smaller
till it became a stoopwalk, We went through and it got big again; this was
virgin passage because Ed hadn't gone through it. The floor was nice and soft
and your feet sank into it. Everywhere we went we saw the evenly dusted floor.
Virgin floors are different from anything else and you can tell when you are
on one, When we reached a mud fill we turned around and left extremely happy i
and satisfied.
When Ed finished ingesting massive quantities of food, we started for
the entrance. While travelling towards the entrance we had set points to stop
in the cave. These were the Arlee Way, the entrance to the BWO.B, a dome near
our lead where there was water, and where we started our surveying. These pro-
vided us adequate rests along with recarb stops. At the Arlee Way on the way
out we had trouble getting into the mood to go for the entrance.
It took us ten hours to get out because we had to climb the rope and
coil it. Ed got extra caving in because he had all three of his packs and the
rope too. Finally we were out at 2:30 pm Sunday. We stumbled back to the field
house; thoroughly exhausted I fell into bed ignorant of the rest of the day.
I didn't get up until the next morning so Ed catch his plane. Bill and I spent
the rest of the day looking at rock outcrops and driving home.
August 15, Bill Koerschner, Sue Heazel and I took off for Kentucky with
Philip Balister and Win Wright behind us in Philip's truck. We took the route
through Nashville again because Ed Devine was flying down. .
We immediately met Ed who had to take an earlier flight, he drove the
car to Cave City. On the way he got Philip and Win totally lost with his city
driving habits. Philip followed what he thought was Bill's car into the heart
of Nashville and then got back to the Interstate and got a speeding ticket.
We got back together in Cave City and went on to the field house.
