26
About 5 am in walked Keith Ortiz and his gang along with Joe Saunders.
Koerschner, who was sleeping on the porch didn't get bothered this time, but
all of us inside had the lights turned on on us and had to put up with Joe
Saunders snoring like a freight train, Somehow we all got some sleep.
In the morning we woke and went into town for breakfast. When we came
back everyone was gone, but the refrigerator was full of food. We got dressed
slowly and eventually got around to walking to the cave after a short rainfall.
Afetr we got to the cave it only took us 6 hours to back to the dome
near the Red Tag Special (the huge trunk) but this time we went through the
Brucker Connection. The Brucker Connection was found as a shortcut to get to
the Lower Black River; the trip in June we had. taken the bypass to the Con-
nection. We didn't think the bypass was any better so we took the Connection
this time. The Brucker Connection involves wading in water that at times al-
most reaches your crotch (if you are 6 feet tall). We didn't think this was as
bad as climbing up sandstone boulder piles so we took it. This cut the time
some and we made it back in two hours less than before.
When we got to the Red Tag Special we looked around and decided what lead
to do.. We decided that our two crews should map in a canyon lead that was head-
ing south. Part of this lead had been mapped but the survey was not any good.
Ed, Win and Sue started surveying about 500 feet in. Bill, Philip and I
did the resurvey. Neither crew even reached virgin passage because of the group
that had done the original survey. Their survey gear malfunctioned and couldn't
do much so they raped the lead for humanity and the hell of it. We weren't too
happy with this so we sat around and cussed alot. The size wasn't too good
either; it was only two feet wide at most places and smaller at others.
Although it wasfun, we did survey a bit with the two crews. After survey-
ing for eight hours we started out. Most of us were in for 27 hours. When we
got out we found a note from Pete Crecelius on a cooler chest full of beer,
soft drinks, and candy bars. We waited there for Ed, who was the last again
because he had dropped his three packs down a thin slot and had to dive in after
them.
After we finished dressing, Pete took off for home, and we went into town
to eat. In the morning we got up and talked to Ortiz. for awhile. After that, we
visited Mammoth Cave and thought of going on a tourista, but we didn't have
time. When we got through buying some maps we started off for Cumberland Gap.
About nine o'clock that night we were back in Blacksburg.
The last weekend of October, Roppel aquired a new entrance. An entrance
dig that people had been working on for the whole summer opened to where they
thought it would. Now three to four hours of travelling time time has been taken
off a trip. Apparently the passage to the main drag is small and wet. We'll see
in December when we go there again.
Our three trips to Roppel have helped push its total length to over 30
miles with our find of the Red Tag Special. Hopefully we will be able to find
more cave in our future trips and raise the mileage some more. There is a good
chance for this because there are many good leads throughout the cave,
