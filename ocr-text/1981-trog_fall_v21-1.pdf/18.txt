I am quite pleased
with this seat design, and
I feel that its adjustability
makes it widely applicable
for many caving situations
and cavers. I have received
many favorable comments on
it, and a few cavers have
already produced copies for
themselves. The dimensions
provided are not absolute,
but they leave room for a
moderate amount of adjust-
ment up or down from a per-
son of medium build,
