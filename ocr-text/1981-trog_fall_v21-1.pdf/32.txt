kit in case we needed it as well as 150 feet of Goldline, 'I threw 30 feet
of rope down to the lip of the visible slope (with a knot in the end) and
John put his back on the wall, his feet on a ceiling channel, and belayed
the rope. The complete lack of any natural anchor made things difficult.
I rapelled down to the lip and looked down a sheer 60 foot drop while
slipping around on the mud. I was peering downwards for sveral minutes
before I remembered to turn around to see if the canyon did indeed continue.
Bingo! A tunnel about 10' by 10' disappeared into blackness. I left the
rope and said I would be back in ten minutes. I needed to see if there was
enough passage to warrent setting a bolt and mapping it, Ten minutes later
I was back and yelled, "John, set the bolt!" The only thing that upset me
was that none of it was virgin. The first writing I saw was "NSS 2177."
Bill Cuddington strikes again. Above that was "Tom Starnes" and "W. C.
Gelispie". At the end of one passage was "Carts". Undoubtably Stan.
. Fifty feet from the drop the passage forked. The left fork narrowed
down quickly and was lost in breakdown about 70 feet further on. One mid-
get stream lead remains. The right fork opened up after 50 feet into an
upsloping breakdown passage which we named Avalanche Alley. Immediately
afterwards we hit a breakdown choke, Apparently there was a large room
above us which both forks entered but which has collapsed. Hopefully that
stream lead will go under the breakdown and bypass it to more passage be-
yond. Total passage amounted to only about 250 feet, but at least that is
one less time consuming corner of the cave.
One good thing about that trip was the discovery of a large chock-
stone which can be used as an anchor for the canyon drop. This is much
better than rapelling in the falls as is usually done.
We removed the hanger and covered the bolt with mud so no one else
could be tempted to use it. I had my camera so we fairly well documented
that trip. The large bullfrog, still alive and kicking and fat, was kind
enough to pose for a picture or two with John, He must be living off of
the salamanders.
We got back to the entrance and started sorting gear. I had Jim
pushing leads on the other side of the entrance but nothing looked prom-
ising. One very unlikely crack remained and he popped in and disappeared.
He came back and said, "it goes!", but he wouldn't push further until we
gave him a rat bat. He was afraid of gettingbitten by something. Appar-
ently there are two passages extending in opposite directions; Good, juicy
leads for the next trip. We then trudged back to the car, got some apples,
and headed back to Blacksburg and the Hokie House.
The next few trips we'll map the left side of the cave (which I
haven't touched), all the stream crawls and entrance area, and most of
the seven known high leads. My next trip I will take a 40 foot exten-
sion ladder (taken down in 20 foot sections) and climb into four of the
high leads. Out of the seven, only one is known to have been explored.
Total passage surveyed so far is 3000 feet. The 1948 Earl Thierry map
had a total of 3300 feet, so I will far surpass that mark and probably
go over a mile,
