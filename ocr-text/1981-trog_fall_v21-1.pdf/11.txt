Summer Caving in Bâ€™burg
'This is for all of you who for some reason don't stay arround
Blacksburg during the summer. Many cavers who do stay arround get a chance
to do more caving than during the school year, I am one of these people,
What follows will perhaps give you an idea what a Blacksburg summer of caving
can be like.
June 6 - McClungs Cave
Fran Wistoff and I threw our gear in her car and took off for West
Virginia, After finding Bob Amundson we went to survey in McClung's Cave,
Once in the cave we travelled two hours to where we started surveying. After
a few hours the passage had gotten smaller, and smaller, until it was just a
belly crawl. Then it got big again and stayed big for a while until we had
to go down a small chute. Once again it was a belly crawl, but as we were
burning out I heard an echo ahead. I thumped on to see if we could finish
quickly; just ten feet ahead was a big room. Bob decided to go on to the room
and then decide what to do.
This room lead into another that had a stream that bubbled in and
flowed out the other end. This was the end unless we wanted to hold our
breath and swim a little. The crawls were longer than I remembered from before
but I survived them. We made it out fine except for being soaked by a waterfall
we couldn't avoid. The trip took us eleven hours, once again a half a day was
taken from us by Ol' man McClung. After eating we settled down to bed in the
WVACS field house.
June 20 - Haynes and Laurel Creek
This weekend I took a rest; I went caving on a short trip in West
virginia with Bill Sydor. We went to Haynes and Laurel Creek caves, and I got
in an easy eight hours. The last trip I had been on that was lees than ten
hours was the day after picnic, and before that it was in February. So it was
nice to do something short.
June 27 - Banes Spring
The next weekend I went to Banes Spring with Bill Koerschner and Bill
Shipman. The purpose of this trip was to teach me how to sketch. I did okay...
but it's a good thing Koerschner took notes also.
July 3 - Spruce Run Mountain Cave
I went with Walt Pirie, Lawrence Britt, and Sue Heazel into Spruce Run
for a nice long trip of an hour and a half.
July 4 -Newberry-Banes
The next day I was underground in Skydusky, with Ed Devine, Bill
Koerschner, and a damn heavy but short "Diddley Pole".
This scaling pole was only about twenty feet long. It was made up of
four inch aluminum angle in several lengths. Certain areas were milled so
that they would mate with another piece. The pieces were numbered so that
they could be bolted together in order. They are also doubled in the middle
for extra strength, which means they are heavy as hell.
Ed and I had the angle pieces split between us; he got the heaviest and
I got the lightest. Bill carried the hardware, which was in two packs.
