"It still goes," came periodic reports, but finally, "I'm coming
back." The cave had sumped out as expected. The ceiling gradually reached
the water some fifty feet past where Jim had stopped,
Cold and wet, they decided to make it a day. Slogging back through the
stream, they stopped momentarily for Garrie to catch his breath.
"What's that?" Garrie asked,
"What?"
"There." Garrie indicated a ledge about seven feet off the floor. On
the ledge was a bottle, Jim took it down and looked at it. "Time Capsule"
was written on it. They opened it and found it contained two peices of 3 X 5
card, neither of which they could get out with wet fingers. Rather than allow
whatever was in it to mold from the newly introduced dampness, our explorers
brought the time capsule out with them.
They went back to the car, genuinely cold and wet, and signed back in.
After several beers and a generous helping of spagetti a la carboara, Jim
and Garrie dried the time capsule in the oven and the card within was
revealed,
"Time placed: 22 May 1959, Members of Company E', V.T.C.C., Class
of 1961."
Final disposition of the said Corps of Cadets time capsule remains to
be debated at the time of this writing.
