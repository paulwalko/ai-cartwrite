"The local I talked to said something about a thirty foot pit in this
cave. I don't see it," Jim said. "Maybe he said thirty feet of shit; I was
pretty drunk at the time." Garrie, who had always had a proclivity for
nasty little crawls, noted that at their feet: was an obvious little passage
which was blocked with a corroded steel bucket, a few rocks, and an enormous
turd,
"Be my guest,".Jim said. A few moments of bucket brigade revealed an
obviously nasty little crawl leading horizontally at a right angle to the
main trend of the cave. Garrie negotiated the passage with little difficulty.
Â· "Jim, I found the pit," came a somewhat muffled voice at the other end.
"Hey, this is pretty neat, Come on through."
Jim donned his pack and within a few moments was hopelessly stuck.
"Garrie, you didn't tell me I had to take off my helmet.
"Yeah, Jim, you've got to take off your helmet."
"Garrie, I can't. My arms are wedged under me." Garrie climbed back
into the little crawl. Halfway in there was Jim, or rather, Jim's orange
helmet, brim down in the dirt floor, its oval shape nearly filling the pass-
age.
"Is that you, Jim?"
"Go to hell. See if you can get my helmet off." Garrie reached over,
got a hold on the helmet with both hands and pulled,
"Claggk!" Chinstrap. A few more expletives followed as Jim did a neck
arabesque to get his chin within reach of his fingers. The strap finally
undid; the helmet came off, and Jim, for the first time in a while, could
see. The passage was oval and narrow from side to side where he was. After
two feet of adjustment space it changed to narrow from top to bottom. As
Garrie backed out, Jim moved forward and got his arms in front of him. Three
good exhale-moves.later his head popped out of the crawl about halfway up a
fifteen foot dome pit six feet in diameter. Some careful maneuvering was
required to get his butt through the last tight spot without launching him
self headfirst into the pit, but having accomplished this, he complimented
Garrie on finding the only pretty part of the cave.
They spent a few minutes verifying that the few possible leads went
nowhere, and after a few more episodes of the no-footholds, stuck, and face-
first-in-shit variety, they left the cave, ensuring that everything was
ostensibly the same as they found it. The motion to find and explore Pro-
fessor Davidson's number two was killed without debate.
Back in the mudmobile, Jim and Garrie at last reached the part of
Ellett Valley where their day's objectives were to be found: Johnson's
and Cat Trap Caves. They arrived at the Johnson's entrance as the dusk
twilight was at its final ebb. Fording the river on foot, Jim and Garrie
found the hole with little difficulty.
After an easy clamber down to stream level they found themselves once
again in nice walking passage. Two hundred fifty feet or thereabouts up-
stream, a large flowstone formation obstructed the passage. Garrie chimneyed
up and over it. Jim slithered under, in the stream. He was in no mood for
tight crawls in light of his prior experience that day.
Our adventurous pair continued on, sometimes sinking ankle deep in
quicksand-like mud. Many formations were noted: flowstone," dripstone, bacon
rind, and some soda straws over a foot long. A couple of hundred feet fur-
ther they wandered until headroom failed. Jim again allowed Garrie the...
privledge of tight space exploration. Back further and further Garrie went.
