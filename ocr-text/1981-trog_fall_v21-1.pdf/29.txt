SPITS & SPUTTERS
So you want to drive down the road and chew tobacco at the same
time, eh? Chewing tobacco in a car creates several problems, especially
at highway speeds. It is difficult to spit out the window without leaving
tobacco otains all along the side of the car. When it's raining or when
the air conditioner is on, it becomes a hassle to keep opening and
closing the window. If a spit cup is used you have to worry about spillage
or emptying it periodically.
A Self-emptying Automobile Cuspidor solveo all these problems with
a drain tube and an integral high-energy venturi. The spittoon is made
from an empty Planters peanut can that is firmly attached to the car
floor. The top is cut from a plastic bottle and inverted to serve as a
funnel. A section of copper tubing is attached to the bottom of the spittoon
and goes through the floor to a venturi (See drawing). Air flowing under
the car enters the venturi, increases in velocity and atomizes the liquid
tobacco stream making it invisible to passing motorists.
This cuspidor system is designed without moving parts for long term
service and little or no maintenance, Material costs are cheap; the venturi
can be fabricated from beer cans held together with Super Mue or Canvas-
Grip. Cleaning is accomplished by merely dumping a glass of water into the
spittoon. Tough cleaning problems can be solved with some Liquid Plumber.
