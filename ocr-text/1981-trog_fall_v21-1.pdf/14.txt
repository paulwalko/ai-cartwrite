"After his first hour underground, Nicholai knew this was the sport
for him. His body, lithe and wiry, seemed designed for slithering through
tight spots... And the fascination of danger was seductive to him... But
the moments of risk and daring in the caves were personal, silent, and
unobserved; and they had the special spice of involving primitive animal
fears, In vertical work down a shaft, there was the thrill and fear of
falling, native to all animals and honed keener by the knowledge that the
fall would be into a black void below, rather than into the decorative
landscape beneath the mountain climber. In the caves, there was the constant
presence of cold and damp, primordial fears for man, and real ones for the
caver, as most grave accidents and deaths result from hypothermia. There
was also the animal dread of the dark, of endless blackness and the ever-
present thought of getting lost in mazes of slits and belly crawls so tight
that retreat was impossible because of the jointing of the human body...
And there was the constant mental pressure of knowing that just above him,
often scraping against his back' as he wiggled through a tight cave, were
thousands of tons of rock that must inevitably one day obey gravity and
fill in the passage."
