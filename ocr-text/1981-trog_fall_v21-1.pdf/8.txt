The Editor's Think - -
That Religious Services should be held on Sunday Trips, .. This has
been mentioned before and seems to meet with genuine approval... Some def-
inite steps should be taken in this direction, delegating the responsibility
for planning, and seeing these plans carried through, wither: (1) to the
Program Committee, (2) to a Sunday Service Committee, or (3) to the Vice-
President... Well presented services would add greatly to the value of our
trips and would allow those persons to accompany us who feel that they would
lose more in neglecting their religious services than they would gain, esthet-
ically, in the spirit of spelunking. Perhaps this is so, and bringing the two
together seems an excellent, and proper, action.

ACCURATE FACTS & CORRODED FIGURES
The grotto's usual way of measuring the depth of a vertical drop is to
let fall a rock and time its descent. I have calculated a table of values,
allowing for the air resistance and the time for sound to travel back.
Assuming that the rock is two inches in diameter, the ballistigs co-
efficient is 0.08, the acceleration due to gravity is 32.160 ft/sec, the
temperature is 50 F, the velocity of sound at that temperature is 1107 ft/sec,
the barometric pressure is 710 mm of mercury, the density of the rock is
2.7, and the price of eggs in China is beside the point; I derived the
following equation:
'.- 16.080 +- 0.4880 +3 - 0.2739 +4 + 0.02413 +5 + 0.00454 +6
-0.000527 +? - 0.000067 +8
(I dare you to check my calculations)
