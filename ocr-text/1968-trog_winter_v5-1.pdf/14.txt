THE THCH TROGLODYTE
Exploration during the Spring of 1948 included the first visit to
the lower level of Starnes Cave. This was before the introduction of
cable ladders. We used rope ladders with wooden rungs. They were quite
heavy when dry. When wet and muddy it was quite an ordeal to carry them
out of a cave.

During 1948 a largo“ number of new caves were discovered and explored.
This work was spearheaded by Earl Thierry.
Also in 1948 we dug a new entrance to Pig Hole. We had only the
mcasurements of the grotto's surveyors to toll us where to dig, Bob
Barnes, a mining engineering student who had made the survey, told us
where to dig. Eight feet from the point indicated the ground looked
softer. (It really wasn't soft.) It's a good thing we dug where we did.
Our shaft struck the edge. of the cave. We would have missed it if we had
followed Bob's advice.
Hard hats were just beginning to be used by the grotto in 1948.
Many of us, including myself, wore the cloth miner's hat. At a time when
the Pig Hole shaft had reached a depth of about ten f'ect, I stood on the
Locust log shoring to remcve a rock that hung dangerously in the side of
the shaft. The shoring gave way and I tumbled to the bottom. The rodk
arrived shortly after striking me in the head. Thrce stitches received at
tho VPI infirmary closed the wound. The hard hat became are popular :
after this.
Digging at Pig Hole started in the Spring of 1948 and progressed
tlırough summer and fall. We uscd dynamite libcrally to break up boulders,
One Saturday afternoon when we had reached a depth of about 15 feet and
wore beginning to wonder if we would ever reach the cave, Earl Thierry
took his turn at the bottom of the shaft digging out dirt and rock. He
liſtod up a rock that released a blast of air -- he had broken into the
cavo. The work then moved rapidly as we enlarged the hole to admit us.
When wc broko into Pig Hole we hed twelve sticks of dynamite left
over. You can't keep this stuff in your dormatory room. You can't throw
the stuff away. Some child might find it and be injured. You can't even
give it away. There is only one thing to do and that is to blow it up,
Now we had used charges varying from half a stick up to three sticks in
Pig Hole. Twelve sticks would make quite a noise, Mr. Protorfield, owner
of Pig Hole, had bcen quite nice to us so we didn't want to shake up his
farm with all that unnecessary roise. We didn't think the Blacksburg police
forco would lot us set it off in town; so we looked îor another cave.
Someone romombered Miller's have in western Giles County. This was a
hole ten feet doop from which em currents issued.
We headed for Miller's carrying the dynamite in 0.16 car and the biasting
caps in another- a standard precaution in transporting this stuff, When
we reached Miller's a couplo of us dropped down into the hole and began
stuffing tho dyramite into a crack in the rock from which the air cane,
ene stick slippod all the way through tho crock and tumbled into the voie below,
