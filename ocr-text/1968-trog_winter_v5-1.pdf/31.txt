ACCURATE FACTS AND CORRODLD FIGURN'S
Grotto Grapevine Vol. I, No.3
Tho grotto's usual way of measuring tho depth of a vertical ärop
is to let a rock fall and time its descent. I have calculated à tab-
le of values, allowing for the air resistance and tho 'timo for sound
to travel back.
'Assuming that the rock is two inches in diameter, the ballistics
coefficiont is .08, the acceleration due to gravity is 32.160 '/sec,
temperature is 500 F, the velocity of sound at that temperature is
1107 ft/sec, the barometric prossuro is 710 mm. of mooury, the humidity
is 100%, tho density of the rock is 2.7, and the price of eggs in
China is beside the point I derived the following equation:
. =16.030+? - .4880+? - .2739+4 +.02413+7.0045476 - .00052+?
- 1 000067+0.
( I dare you to check my calculations)

A.I. Cartwright
R. C. Caldwell
Grotto Grapevino Sop 1, 1944
The Cartwright mystery has at 1 ast been solved; certain facts
about him are about to be disclosed. Hold on to your hats, folks,
here it comes!
This mythical character was adopted as an activo mombor into our
club almost two years ago, from a picture showing Bob Hope. Perhaps
some of us can still remember this movie, in which one of the char-
acters !! just wasn't there ''Cartwright is often erroneously
referred to as Yohudi's first cousin; to my knowlodge he is absolutely
no relation to Yohudi.
There wure so many happenings that could not be attributed to any
of the uthur members of the club, that it was found necossary to get
someono who wasn't to blame these things on. The loss of food, rain
storms, hot-seats -- all these and innumerably more incidents were
20credited to Cartwright's long list of accomplishments. The adoption
of this beloved character into the club can be attributed to ono Crouch
who has long since been departed from our midut
