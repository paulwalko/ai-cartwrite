The remaining eleven were put in place and fused. Someone held a carbido
lamp close to the fuse until it began to sputter. He yelled, "Fire in the
hole." Then casually climbed to the surface, We had long since learned not
to run when a fuse is lit. It is much safer to use an adequate length
of fuse , ko sure it is properly lighted, then walk ewey.' We all strollod
down the hill and waited for tho explosion, when it came it was a big
one that sent us all running (after the 'blast. We always ran) back to the
hcle to set what we had done. We reached the hole just after the last of
the earth and rock shower hit the ground. But, alas, we could not entor,
The hole was so filled with dynamite fumes that it was unsafe. So we returned
to Blacksburg still wondering what we had accomplished.
A weck or two lator we returned to explore the cave. The dynamite
had opened the crack sufficiently for us to enter, Seventy feet down,
at the bottom of the entrance drop, we found the one stick of dynanito
mexploded. It is still thero for all I know.
During my stay ač V.P.I. the Grotto explored and surveyed quite a
number of caves. Here are a few random . notes on this activity.
August, 1949 Loumoor Cave in Alleghany County surveyed; no now
exploration,
In October 1948. We explored a very small tave in Giles County called
School Cave. It is at Lat. 37 17' 11'' Long. 0 37' 2911. We climbed
down a rope, The last man in inadvertanly and without noticing set fire
to the end of the rope at the top of the drop with his carbide lamp. While
We explored below, the flame burned toward the knot. Fortuneately, the
first man out reached the surface before the flames reached the knot.
During the 1948–1951 era about two trips were made into clover
Hollow Cave. The original cxploration had been done bofore this era.
In 1950 now passages were discovered beyond the waterfall in Now
River Cave. Roy Charlton and Adam Chou pushed this explorati on,
In October 1948, Old Mill Cave was discovered, explored, and mapped,
In April, 1950, Fuck Hill Cave on property owned by Natural Bridge
Inc. in Ecckbridge County, was explored and mapped.
Numcrcus caves were discovered, explored, and mapped in Tazewell Count.
The above covers a small, but representative, frac!ion of the Grotto
activities during this period.
During the 1949-50 school year I was chairman of the Grotto, Hank
Wiss was faculty advisor.
Harzy Wobb was chairman during the 1950-51 school yonr.
