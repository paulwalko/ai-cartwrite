THE TECH TROGLODYTU

storms , hot-seats -- all these and innumerably more incidents were
accredited to Cartwright's long list of accomplishments. The adoption
of this boloved charactor into the club can be attributed to ono Crouch,
who has long since boon departed from our midst. The idea sprcad l'ap-
ialy and Cartwright was readily accopted as a member by everyono. Lator
he was given the namo Aloysius Ignats by R. N. Southworth, ex-poot laur-
ete of this paper, while. J.H.0.H. ( Jarvis H.0. Hoffman for short) had
name tags made and really pushed his popularity.
As time went on Cartwright became more and more infamous, causing
flat tiros, light gremlins, tight squvozos, ctc; as now mombers came
into the club, his rwal identity was kopt a secret. He often signed
Pledgoo's cards and did othor things that flash-n-blwod members did.
He became Chiof-Editor-in Chiof of our paper at tho first staff mootor
ing and has retained that position over since.
At one time a continued article on Cartwright's life was begun
by C.F. Moore, but was abonded after two issues. He is supposed to
have discovered America in 1491 by way of his present abodo, Clover
· Kollow Cave, which to our knowledgohas no end.. lIo often comes from
his home to play pratical jokes on the other cavers, and to holp jis
in our soomingly impossible tasks. Always he is the life of the party
and ho loves to play hide and sook- mostly hide. By him the possiblo
is donc casily; the impossiblú takes more timo,
Cartwright is an inspiration to all cavors and is tho propelling
factor that forces us on when the going gets tough - you know, the get
going- or - I - got- free-with- rocks,- carbide- flames- etcos mothod
of encouragemonto. He has high ideals and is the originator of our spelec
definition that "la spoleo is the only croature that can got lower
than anything clse on earth, yot have his mind as high as heaven.''
