In the fall oí 1958, I had iir, joulton and ir. Quinlan nale a
survey of thö cxtent of the so called guano deposit in Fiz Holo, This
112s con: at the requost of Ir. Pl. Porterſiuld of sucboard Bros. 230
Co., who had purchased an otion to buy thi contents or t!20 cave from
the owner. ir. A., Porturſield and I took souples of the donosit which
Wuic sent to the State Department of Agriculture and 11z.ligration for
analysis. Another sample along with the above analysis reports vis sont
to the United States Guano Corp. in Kingman, Tizone. The above reports
and the reply from the United States Guano Corp. are includod licro
through thu kind permission of lir. A.R. Portorfield.
The present owner of the cavo roportedly told one of tho wilders of
the Cavo Club, S0x10 twenty ycers go, that his grandfathor told of 2
tinction bats came out of this cavo in such laro nwbors lilcc tricy
blackened the sky over a largo arca. Hoto that no mention was cdc of
tho oimor or his father sewing thiscs bais. Thus, ir tiro above süsti lont
is true, this uetes the bats around ono hundred yo..i's 260.
I do not icol that tho nov ontranco has acterially occtud too.
boc pomilation, wet I do think is thet soplu tine in tiu post this large
colony of bats ran out of food. Ii Cìs 17: Che ci sö larg nu be:3 of
11.7.ts may have starved and died in tho cavo. T is supposition - and it
is only a suosition would account for the nature of tho donosit in
Pig ilolu Cave,
The proble: 1 of the lost bats of Pig Hole Cavo is still open to
quüstion, Perla, no someon, will come i ort!! jith wore and/or bottor
iníoriation on this subject, i
(cditor's note: iir. Wiatt is a fornor melabor of the Cavo Club and is
currently Assistant Director of Housing at VPI)
Tito coitors of this Silver Annivursary issui tsh to thank tho
past nebers of the VPI Cave Club without whoso oxistanco tliis occasion
would not havo been jossibile, .
