IMPRESSIONS OF THE CAVE CLUB
Early Days of VPI Cave Club
by Henry H.Wiss
It was about 1943 when the Cave Club, as it was known then, got its
start. VPI was under wartime conditions with a rather smallcadet corps
and some 4F's and a rather large group of ASTP men. The ASTP was the
Army Specialized Training Program in which soldiers with the ability to
pass certain exams were sent to colleges for advanced study. It was a
sort of brain "cold storager till they could be used more advantageously
in the armed services. I must not fail to mention that there were
interested coed cavees at this time also.
Caving was rather primative in those days as to the roping techniques
used today but there was just as much adventure. It was also an
excellent excuse for the cadets, the coeds, and the soldiers to get off
the campus and out of the military clutches.
The gear was rope ladders, fopes, lamps, and a variety of soft and
hard hatsincluding converted helmet. liners. Clothes were generally army
fatigues and anything else you could get hold of. The girls were
definitely not glamorous, in their borrowed men's clothes.
I wont on the second trip to Clover Hollow and it still very much
unexplored. The first party had tried to improvise ladiers and other
means to get over some of the most difficult places but it was still
explored with misgivings. The most exciting part was the way down to
the creek and to the waterfall. Now I understand there is a trail which
you can take. In those days we approached it by means of a hole in the
ceiling of the canyon where the creek flows. You looked down through
the hole to the creek 90 of so ieot below you. A log was placed across
the hole and a block and tackle was fastened to it and then we let each
person down the 90 foot in a breeches bouy. As you dangled there in
space in almost'.pitch darkness it was terrible! One person stayed on
top to be sure that we all got out. After exploring that cathedral
like canyon we started back to the surface. As Jean was being hoisted
we were horrified to suddenly see the rope catch on fire from her lamp.
It flared up above her head for about fifty feet and then went out -
we all breathed a sigh of relief. When we had all gotten up but Jack we
all helped to pull on the rope. It became harder and harder to pull
and we all wondered what was causing it. Finn777 coneone looked at the
pulley and found that the rope had slipped off and was tearing to pieces.
Jack was just below so we all grabben the ropes and pulled him up bodily/
I still wonder how we had the strength to do it but our strength didn't
last long -We all collapsed - We just didn't have enough strength to
stand up.
I believe our group was the inventor of the outstanding caving
technique which we named the "Fanny Foot Techniquel. We were exploring
Catawba Murder Hole and going through a nariow. passage when we came to
