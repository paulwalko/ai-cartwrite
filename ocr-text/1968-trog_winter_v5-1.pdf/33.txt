SILVER ANNIVERSARY 1943-1968
Projection-Golden Anniversary
1993
Caving has progressed to a sophistication which would have been
difficult to conceive when our Grotto was a mero 25 years young. The
advent of the electric prusik in the lato 60's opened vertical caves to nearly
cvery person so inclined. Though frowned upon at first, the "Karras
Wheel" as it was. dcrogatoril' called by early cynics, saver many an
exhausted spelunkor before the GPE came into common use,
Supprisingly cnough as late as 1984 the metallic "brako bar" and
carabiner was still in use as descending devices by a certain faction of
cavers on the Christiansburg Quadrangle of the campus. Most of the Club had
adopted the water cooled rappel spcol invented by Tiko Hanilton in 1964
with the addition of clectronic spcod controling option which automatically
put on extra turns of rope as needed.
Uniori Carbide's discovery of a new isotope of Cac, in 175 gave a ten
hour run for a single charge and made the conservationists extremely
happy due to the decreased froqucntcy of spent corbide dumping. The atomic
"Justrite" hes now climinatod the arngerous flans and the problem of
sufficient illumination,
Perhaps the GPE, gravitational potential cquilizers, or force ficlas,
as the romantics still insist on calling them, have made the most radical
change in the sport. The editors find it hard to beliove that man would
actually allow himself to venture beneath the c?rth protected only hy a
flimsy shcll of fiberglass on his hoed and primitive cloth covering the rest
of his body. Without the GPE they ran the risk of becoming scraped and
bruised by protrusions in the cave passages but we must say , although this
thought repulses most, that there is a certain thrill in turning off the
power pack and actually fooling the dirt and mud as oorly subterranen
explorers oncc did.
