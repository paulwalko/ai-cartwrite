ILVBR ANNIVRSARY 1
EDITOR'S COLUMN
The VPI Grotto has gone into the black more than any other
caving organization in the world. This is not a financial report but
the proud boast of two and a half decades of Cave Club members at
Virginia Tech. Located in the heart of Virginia's prime caving country
and near to the large systems of West Virginia, VPI has been able to
offcr more than ample opportunity for the scores of enthusiastic
spelunkors who have passed through its hallowed halls. Since the
granting of our charter by tho itational Speleological Society on January
8, 1943, the Grotto has continually worked towards the aims and goals
set forth by the national organization and contributed greatly in making
caving the great sport that it is today.
This year we celebrate our Silver Anniversary, a mark in the short
history of organized caving attainod by only one other grotto. In order
to help colebrate the event this special Silver Troglodyto was conceived.
For the reader who has not boon acquainted with the compiling of this
journal, a short introduction and explanation of its format follows.
The first article is the history of the Grotto as compiled by two
prosent members. . Many long and late hours were put in to try and create
a coherent saga from the voluminous files of the VPI Cave Club but
many discrepancies may be noticed betweon facts in this history and
later articles. But VPI cavers being more prone to caving than journ-
alism have left unfortunate holes in our early records which we have
yet to fully explore.
Two of the Grotto's former faculty sponsors have supplied our next
two articles followed by two letters written in 1964 by former active
members when thougiats of compiling Ã  Club history were young.
Next, one will find a few trip reports written in "the old days"
in the section we call the "Karstophagus". The last two sections should
give an idea of the impressions that caving made in years past.
From the subterranean archives a dusty copy of the first minutes
has been included in which the reader may see the Grotio conceived, its
first president elected, and a constitution drawn up and adopted. The
first page of this constitution has been included while the complete
document rests in the files for any interested persons.
The Grotto Grapevine, first publication of any grotto, furnishes
material in the next section. January 1944 saw the first issue go to
press and it has been recreated in vivid black and white for the benefit
of the viewer. Solocted articles from later issues seek to acquaint
the reader with the sense of humor of the VPI caver.
Throughout this issuo are spaced other small items which we hope
will be of interest,
