William's Mine
By Dave Colatosti
Sung to Folsom Prison by Johnny Cash
I hear that drill a runnin', runnin'round the bend.
And I ain't been in a real cave since I don't know when.
Well I'm stuck in William's mine, I know I can't be free.
But that breeze keeps a blowin', and that's what tortures me.
When I was just a trainee, the old farts told me “Son,
Don't ever mess with dynamite, that's just not how it's done.”
Well I popped some rocks in other caves, just to see how it goes.
Now that William's mine has got me and it really blows.
I wish I were in a virgin pit, rappellin' on four bars
Scoopin up the booty, and goin real far.
But I knew I had it comin' in Ben's promisin' dig
Though that air keeps a movin, I wish the cave would get big.
If we only got some booty, if there only was sign.
I'd dig on through the whole day, never would I whine
But I'm stuck in William's mine, that's where I have to stay
And I let that breeze keep blowin' those minin' blues away.
