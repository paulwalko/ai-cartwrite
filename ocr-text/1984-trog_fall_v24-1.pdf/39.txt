VPI CAVE CLUB RESCUE GEAR:
Equipment Inventory and Suggestions for Use.
By Rescue Chairman Lawrence Britt 12/83
First aid kits 1,2, and 3 are to be used in case a search
for the victim is necessary. Three groups of four people each
should enter the cave after a search plan is worked out on the
surface, A person should be permantly stationed at the entrance
with pencil and paper to record the names of everyone who enters
the cave and should check thier names off as they exit. Each
search group should have a first aid kit which contains basic
supplies. Once the victim is found, two stay with him and
two exit the cave to tell the surface coordinator his location.
Flag markers are provided to mark the easiest route.
Immediately kit #4 should be taken to the victim if he has
suffered severe trauma as well as two wool blankets.. The arm
and leg splints should go if needed. As quickly as possible the
ABS Stokes litter should be carried in with sling to immobilize
the victim. The surface coordinator will then appoint an
underground coordinator who will grab the chocks, pulleys, sling
and ropes and enter the cave to start rigging the crawlways and
drops. Rigging should always start at the victim and proceed.
outward. As each drop is successfully negociated on the way out
it should be derigged and that gear taken past the victim to the
next drop lacking gear.
We have a chock pack with twelve chocks, each fitted with
a carabiner and a runner. We also have a complete bolt kit for
those who know how to use it. The rigging pack has seven sets
of SARA pulleys and carabiners as well as three GIBBS ascenders
for stor cams and tensioning. A rack is provided for high line
systems as well as assorted sling for rigging.
A four point suspension is in a box tied to the Stokes to
permit a victin in shock to be raised horizontally. A full face
mask (welders) is also included. The wire litter should not be
used underground because it has no insulating qualities (the
Stokes has insulite) and no underneath support when setting the
patient on a rock floor. The Reeves stretcher is used for
tight places where the Stokes can't get thru.
We also have a battery supported set of Army Surplus
field telephones with several thousand feet of wire. If the
rescue is going to be a long one or a complicated one, the
telephone system should be run from the entrance to as close as
possible to the victim. Then, when more gear is needed, it can
be called to the surface and 2 runners can bring it in.
There is also a food pack. Food and liquids should not
be given to anyone with a head or stomach injury.
In addition to the Rescue Gear, we also have Club
Equipment. Anyone who has paid dues can check out the gear for
a weekend. 6 carbide lamps, & hardhats complete with garbage bags,
5 survey tapes-Keson, 501, 5 Bruntons, Å† pr Suuntos, 5 Cable
ladders-10 meter. Also we have a club tarp make from parachute
material (approx. 20' x 30') with 20 stakes and a stake puller.
