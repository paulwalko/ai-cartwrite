Let's Talk Technique
I was very glad to learn about the club's concern for
belaying someone on rappel and would like to add and analyze
some various systems and devices for this technique.
Bottom Belay
The first obstacle encountered with this technique is
for the first caver down, since no one has been into the
pit yet, . In this case, the caver may want to use the
technique of the trailing ascender which will be discussed
later. For the second or third caver, there will be no
problem while rappelling because some one will belay their
descent from the bottom. This is a nice method, unfortunately
not all drops are the same (waterfalls & a range of depths).
Rocks dislodged by the person on rope could be a potential
hazard to the belayer, so he should always be in a protected
area, away from the main rock fall zone. Waterfalls and
stream caves present another obstacle in that voice communica-
tion may not be possible due to excessive noise. And in the
BIG pits, the stretch of the ropes will vary with the brand
but remember El Sotano del Barro, Mexico is a 412 meter free
drop and with a static rope (approx 2% stretch) the belayer
would have to pull up nearly 30 feet of slack!
Trailing Ascender & Auto Belay
Fewer cavers use such a device, than use the bottom..
belay. Many devices can be used but once again which is
the best, or safest, or most efficient? There are several
different types on the market: Jumars, clog, Petzl Handled
Jariners, CMI, Bonaiti, Gibbs Speleanshunt, or the .Shunt by
Petzl.
Now, when would such an Auto belay be used? A couple
many cases are: loss of control or getting knocked
unconcious by a falling rock. In these cases, the bottom
belay (if you are not first), trailing ascender auto belay
or stop bobbin descender (made by Petzl) could save us
from an untimely demise. However, in the loss of control
case the rope can be damaged by the cam (except with the
shunt or stop descender). Speed is increasing on the
descent and we want to stop via such ascenders and at the
moment they catch, the shock is not absorbed and the
rope sheath will take the shock.
Shunt
Fortunately, Petzl has designed a special device for
Auto belay, called the Shunt. The shunt has been designed
for use on single and double rope techniques. The cams are
two smooth cylinders that stop the descent by pressing the .
rope against the aluminum body, absorbing the shock and not
biting into the rope as the other ascenders do (except the
Hiebeler and prussik knots).
