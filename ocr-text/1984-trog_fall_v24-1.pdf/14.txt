No Mess, No Fuss Stoves
by Paul Soboleski
While surveying with Mike Futrell and Frank Gibson in
Wilburn Valley, I was blessed with having both cans of my
Dinty Moore's fall off of my Butterfly stove. As a result
of this incident, I thought there had to be a better way to
heat food while mapping. I came up with this idea: Simply
cut the innermost corner of each of the stove's legs as
illustrated below. A hacksaw works better than wire snips,
but takes longer. 'Wire snips tend to roll the metal edges
over. The 3/16" cuts allow the food can to rest directly
on the legs for support, rather than balancing the can on
the rounded corners of the legs. Bon Appetit!!
