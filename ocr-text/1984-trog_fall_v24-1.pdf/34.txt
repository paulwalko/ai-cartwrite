We finished up the survey the next day and took pictures
of the equipment we had used in the survey, except the EDMI
of course,
That weekend, at the request of Joe Zokaites, we went
back out to take two pictures of each entrance station and
write detailed, official - type station descriptions. A copy
of each will go into the club files for future reference,
Meanwhile, back at the C-8, I was working on compiling
the second half of the mapa Mike and I had been reducing
the entrance location data as we gathered it, Mike had
computed the coordinates on the HP 9815 computer and I had
plotted all of the entrances on the map with the aid of the
digitizer. All that remained was to finish the contours, ink
the map, and write this report,
Up to this point I had spent most of my academic time
on this project and my other class was hurting pretty badly.
I decided to channel my efforts into the direction of passing
my final and looking for a job, which meant taking an incom-
plete on the Skydusky Project and finishing it after I came
back from OTR and a couple of weeks of R&R in California.
So here it is, the middle of October, The map is comple-
ted and inked, very nicely I might add, and I'm putting
the finishing touches on this article. It just goes to show
that what Dr. Johnson said to me at the beginning of this
project was true: when planning your work schedule, you
should estimate the amount of time it will take and double
it, Anyway, it gives me great pleasure to be typing this last
sentence of a successful project and my undergraduate career.
I DON'T CARE HOW BIGIT IS...
THERE'S NO REASON TO FEAR A
CAVE SPIDER!!!
