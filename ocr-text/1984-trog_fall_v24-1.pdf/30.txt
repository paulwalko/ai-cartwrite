z direction, provided by the plotter footwheel, Elevation
is measured when the dot is exactly on the ground by means
to be discussed later. The accuracy of the measured elev&-
tion depends on the precision with which the plotter
operator can put the dot on the ground; an error greater
than a few tenths of a foot is unacceptable. This is a
genuine art which most find difficult and some impossible

Orienting the Stereoplotter
Before the C-8 may be used, the diapositives, plotter and
plotter table must be interfaced. This is accomplished
through a two phase process called orientation. Interior
orientation is done first to recreate the bundle of light
rays in each projector exactly as they were recorded by the
camera. This involves centering the diapositives in the
stages and positioning them so that they are the same dis-
tance from the projector lenses as the film was from the
camera lens during exposure. Once the interior orientation
is complete, exterior orientation may begin.
Exterior orientation is a more involved process broken.
down into relative and absolute orientation. Relative
orientation recreates the relative angular relationship
between the projectors so that conjugate image rays intersect
to form a stereomodel at the desired scale. In this time
consuming iterative process, each stage is rotated about its
X, Y, & Z axis until a clear stereoimage is formed. The
model scale was set at 1"=600!; a l'=300" map scale was
obtained using a 2:1 plotter-to-table gear ratio.
In the absolute part of the exterior orientation the
model is scaled and leveled with respect to the ground.
Scaling is done by computing the spatial (3-D) distances
between photo control points in the model and on the ground
and adjusting the plotter until these vary according to the
