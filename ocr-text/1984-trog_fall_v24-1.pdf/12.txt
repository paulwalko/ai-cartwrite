lead at the top of the dome. Numerous spacious side leads opened out
of this section, but we left these for later trips.
After passing through a 10-inch low spot, the tube ended in an overlook
above a 20' high trickle stream canyon which we followed upstream, to
the west, until it entered a major junction room about 20' high and 15'.
wide. This room had another intersecting trickle stream canyon, numerous
high leads, a 25' dome with a trickle and a high canyon at its west end.
After enjoying a little supper, we tackled the westward canyon lead.
Downstream it looked tight and nasty, but upstream we immediately
entered a 25' x 25' x 30' room with massive sandstone rubble and breakdown
at its western end. We surveyed steeply up and through this choke but
could find no way through. The stuff had a distinctly surface choke look
about it.
As we headed back, we pushed a tight, obscure lead to the left in
the breakdown and popped into a steeply descending canyon in bedrock which
soon opened into the side of a small trickle-stream canyon.
This lead 30' downstream to a 25' drop in the floor thereby eliminating
a nasty climb up the 25' dome we had found earlier. Upstream, to the
west, we surveyed several hundred feet of meandering stream canyon 6'.
high and 2' wide. This ended in sandstone rubble fill which again looked
like surface stuff. However, we had about 3 or 4 tight canyon leads enter-
ing this passage so it still had potential. About this time we decided
to head out. On the way out Joe pushed one of the leads about 50' and
said it was pretty bad and probably ended. We knew we had some rough
surveying ahead for the next trip.
The long trip out was tiring and scary as we climbed back down the
ladder at the dome. We left the VPI Grotto ladder rigged at the dome
figuring that the grief we'd catch for doing that wasn't as bad as having to
reclimb the goldline. We caught up with Miles and Cliff who was finished
with his sump recon and had started work on a tough dig which ended
after 50' of digging through mud and gravel fill when a boulder choke
was encountered.
After a long and tiring drive back to D.C., I plotted the survey
data and discovered that our leads had ended near the surface not 100'
from the main entrance to the cave. .
