of blackberrys and Mike, John and I ended up eating a
delicious Sunday dinner with Buddy.
When it came time for the next trip out, Mike and I
couldn't sucker a single person into helping us. I wonder :
why? This trip was productive but slow since we were only a
two person crew and, as in cave surveying, three is ideal.
We managed to finish Newberry's and Buddy's before the rain
came, Five down and three to go.
We made history on the third trip. The class had not
established a photo control station near Coon cave due to
its remoteness and visibility problems. This being the case,
Mike and I had to traverse all the way from the Harman's
photo control station to Coon as well as to Paul's and
Harmans from their photo control stations in one day, hopeful.
ly. We knew this would be almost impossible if done by stadia,
like the other traverses, because the shots were limited to
a maximum length of 2001 to maintain reasonable accuracy. We
decided to try to talk Dr. Johnson out of his medium range
EDMI, the Kern DM500 which mounts on top of a DKM II-AE
Theodolite, I expected to be turned down since he said he had
never lent an EDMI out before due to its irreplacability
(arount $10,000 worth). I was, to say the least, surprised
when he agreed to let us use it so long as we had it back by
the end of the day. I assured him we would. No problem..
It was a weekday so we didn't leave for Skydusky until
1:30pm. The DM500, which reads to the nearest .001 meters,
has a range of about 500 meters so long shots were a breeze,
We made really good time using three tripods and leapfrogging
the instrument and reflectors until we were within about
three shots of the Coon entrance. That's when darkness set
in.
The distance measureing (lasar) part of the set up works
fine in the dark but we didn't have the battery packs to
illuminate the theodolite verniers to read horizontal and
vertical angles, and it was too dark to point accurately at
the reflector. This was a real problem. We wanted so much
to finish up those final three shots of the survey that we
played cave surveyor and attempted, unsuccessfully, to
illuminate the verniers and reflector with a Bic lighter.
It was about 9:30 PM when we finally gave up.
We had already blown getting the DM500 and DKM II-AE
back at a reasonable hour so we decided to talk to Buddy Penley,
who was sitting out on his porch when we went by. I got
home about two and a half hours and three beers later to a
note on the front door telling me to call Dr. Johnson. I
had real reservations about calling him since it was mid-
night and I expected to get chewed out for being an irres-
ponsible college student (you know the type) and not keeping
up my end of the deal. It turned out that he didn't even
know the instrument wasn't back and he had called to say
that the second stereomedel was almost oriented but that
I needed to check some elevations. What a reli√©f.,
