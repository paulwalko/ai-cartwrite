ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The success of this somewhat challenging project would
not have been possible with out the help of the friends and
associates whom i would like to recognize and thank.
Dr. Steven Johnson was my advising professor on the project;
Matt Swanson, Charles Wagner, George. Bryant, Cass Camp, .
Mike Gaydosh, Bill Ware and Professor Harlan Onsrud, helped
establish the necessary photo control network; Mike Gaydosh,
John Lohner, Richard Cobb and Pat Nickenson helped run the
spur traverses up to the cave entrances; and Mike Gaydosh
spent many hours at the plotter table assisting me in the
compilation of the map.
The class members also wrote reports on the photo control
project, which I used extensively in writing that section of
the report.
I would also like to thank the Landowners of Skydusky
Hollow for their never-ending. cooperation, hospitality, and
patience.
