our side; they tried to boycott it, but people read it any way;
So they tried to ignore it, but it kept comming back to haunt

Summer started out with a bang at convention and for a
change, VPI had a good showing. Jerry Redder showed up with
Gary. MosS and Doug Perkins with Mark Slusarski. Lawrence Britt,
Mike Futrell and Frank Gibson wandered out too, Maureen Handler
even found her way up from Texas. Moose, Karen and Chad stopped
in as part of a summer vacation and over the whole trip, their
van cost more in repairs than it cost them to buy. Frank took
2 merit awards in the Photo Salon and Maureen won the 100!
mechanical clinb with a time of 54.5sec.
The summer months gave lots of good caving all around with
good times to be had by all. CTR was a big success as usual,
There was lots of partying, hot tubbing and saunaing for all
as well as time to see all of those old friends from years gone
by. The more wine party was a hit with cheap wine, cheap friends
and a good loud horn. VPI was again well represented in the
SpeleoOlympics as usual. Win Wright took 3rd place overall and
a lst in the Pop. Maureen got th overall and a lst in the
obstacle course. heith Smith won the prussik contest and got
another set of clog ascenders that he will probably never use.
Ed Devine and Paul Kirchman won Ist and 2nd places respectively
(never!!) in the Surveying contest. Janet Queisser took and in
the Cave quiz and we think Chuck Shorten won something too but
no one can remember what. Jackie Redder fought a hard battle
in the Old Ladies Contest. Doug brought his music for the
party Sunday night which was enjoyed by all and the Ã‚bsense of
Daddy Don was noted by all. The Zo's showed up with a 33%
larger family appropriately named Danzo. Don and Cheryl showed
up again from Oman as well as Carolyn Lewis Grafton from New
Zealand.
Maureen has moved back into town with 'hubby' Alec. Keith
is living in sin with Dave Consavich; RH signed in (probably
by accident). Boo and Theresa tied the knot. Psycho hasn't
been seen with the same girl twice for one of two reasons.
Rick La Course and Suezel got married and Rick is hosing around
Blacksburg selling vacuum cleaners while sue finishes with ,
school. Jim Washington is watching MTV in Richmond and is caving
with RASS (I didn't know FASS Coved, I thought they played BINGO).
Hillary has moved to the Huntsville area and is busy with her
new job and is looking forward to doing some of those Alabama
pits, she reports that her apartment is nearly caver proof and
is expecting us Spring Break. Garrie Rouse is contemplating the
real world and middle age and has given up Tazwell Co. for
vonroe Co. Pat and Chuck have moved to Clemson so Chuck can
