we came out we were so thrilled with what we had accomplished.
We had added 10001+ to the known cave and were the first
to make the connection (as far as I know the only ones so far).
As an added plus (aside from being even more tired and soaked
to the bone) we beat everyone else out ot the cave.
Bright and early the next morning, our crew in Mike's
truck took off for Jalpan and Ahuacatlan for some yo-yoing.
I was finally going to get to do some Mexican pits. The scenery
was beautiful on the way to Jalpan and the drive uneventful,
however, this was not to last.
Mikes truck, which had been acting up on the way to -
San Francisco, was now behaving worse than ever. It really
did not want to be climbing that mountain. Soon we could
all smell gas and that was the first major sign of trouble.
Suddenly Albert yelled "FIRE!" as flames started shooting out
of the floorboards. We all piled out of the truck and threw
a chock stone under the rear wheel. We opened up the hood and
there were 3 & 4 foot flames shooting out of the engine. After
failing to put out the fire with everything from water to beer,
we realized our best recourse to get our gear out before it
was too late to salvage anything. By this time the fire
had burned through the fuel line and everything not make of
metal under the hood was melting. We got all of our gear out
and all we could do was watch old Blue burn. Suddenly, some
thing gave way and it started to roll, right off the side of
the mountain. For an old truck it took the fall well, but it
had reached its final resting place. At this point, we started
wondering how the hell we were going to get home, We were 1000
miles from Austin!! We paid a passing Mexican in a Pick-up
to take us and our gear to Jalpan. We dropped Albert and
Russel off at the road to Puente de Dios to meet up with
Blake that night and the rest of us went into town. We stayed
the night in a hotel with our mountain of gear and awaited our
rescuers. The next morning, Albert and Russell showed up
and told us that Blake hadn't shown up at our designated
camping spot, so we sent Bill to Xilitla in hope of finding
them at the Bird House. A few hours later, Mike and I hopped
on a Chicken bus to Cuidad Valles to start the police and
insurance agent on getting the truck papers organized. During
our bus layover in Xilitla, we met up with Bill again and he
said that he had found Blake but they didnt have tome to rescue
our gear and they had taken off for the States.
Mike and I stayed the night in Valles and awaited Bill,
Russell and Albert at which point I was going to return to the
US with Russell and Albert, while Bill stayed with Mike until
the papers were straightened out. When Bill found us in Valles
he was alone, explaining that they had arrived in town only
10 minutes before the next bus to Monterrey was leaving, and
Russell and Albert had decided to catch the bus instead of
waiting for me. So now I had to travel 700 miles through
Mexico by myself. What an adventure. I nearly got dumped in
