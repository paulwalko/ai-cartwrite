President's Column
0.K. Another year and its my turn to write a president's
column. Already we've had a few projects going on. Recently,
Frank Sizer showed our future engineers how to hang a gate
at the New Castle Murder Hole field entrance. It was truly
a architectural masterpiece. Also a conservation trip was
taken into New River. Be prepared to be volunteered to work
on a new fence around Pighole when the weather becomes
agreeable (weather must be considered outside of caves).
Since I have been with the club we have not had any serious
accidents anyone has admitted to. Let's not get careless.
We have recently acquired some more rescue gear and will
hold a practice rescue early winter quarter just in case.
I'l like to tell the trainee's that you can learn more
from the experienced people in the club, than from any book.
Take advantage of them (yeall) It's not hard to get free
advice. Also, I'd like to encourage new members to carry
their own packs, go up for club membership and support the
National Speleological Society by becomming a member.
I would like to thank all of the committees for
making things run pretty smoothly up to now. If you haven't
participated, most committees would like to
hear your opinion. Also, you too, can be a committee. See
me if your interested.
Do yourself a favor...... take a trainee mapping.
