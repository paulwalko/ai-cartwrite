to the surface due to the unsafe nature of the ladd ers. We
made camp above the doline where the entrances to La Puente
are located. Mike and I continued our scouting around and in
the doline looking for the main entrance to la. Puente. After
an hour or so, we headed back to the base camp.
Â· Lo and behold, right at dusk, Blake and the Hog crew
showed up and we geared up for a trip into Cueva de la Puente.
The cave is large walking passage with many unexplored leads. .
Two of the leads are downstream water entrances. At the first
there was a beautiful set of rimstone dams and in one of the
pools we discovered a unique and beautiful formation. At
first we thought it was some sort of cave biology, it looked
like a white sea anenoma e, but it turned out to be
horizontally growing soda straws just under the water surface.
At the second water lead, I wanted to push upstream because
it was very possible that this stream was the one the station
was pumping froin. I talked Bill and Greg (Hog crew member)
into. coming with me and we took off up stream while everyone
else stayed to look at some more formations. The 3 of us
kept walking upstream through large, wet, walking passage.
I proceeded to fall in the water twice and once nearly drowned
with my heavy boots until I discovered that the water was only
chest deep. After pushing for about 1000', we came to a
low spot and had to crawl, then the passage opened up again
and we were able to walk. Now the passage was full of beautiful,
clean, unvandalized formations. We were awe struck but also
wet and tired. At our next rest stop, we decided to turn
around and give up looking for the connection, when suddenly,
Bill yelled "Hey, What's That??!" As we looked where his light
was shining down the passage, there was a section of ladder
and 10" pipe. We were ecstatic, we had found the connection.
We went on and climbed up the first couple of ladders and when
we looked up, a large part of the ceiling was covered with
2 & 3 foot long soda straws. At the far wall we saw ladders
going up in a waterfall through a big, black hole in the
ceiling.
We then had to decide whether to try to climb the pit
(which for all we knew was 1000' deep) or to go back the way
we had come in. Bill was the only one familiar with the ladders
and he said he wanted to go for it, so we decided to try.
We had to climb 20' sections of 2" angle iron ladders while
hundreds of gallons of cold water was pouring on us from the
pump overflow, Bill and Greg had electric lights, but my carbide
lamp soon became useless, and I had to proceed with only a .
flashlight which I held in my teeth as I lead the way up.
The ladders were ingeneously rigged for Mexican technology.
2 lig" diameter bars were set into the walls about 27z! apart.
A wooden or metal sheet served as a platform. The ladder's
base was resting on this platform while the top of the ladder
was held onto the next platform by baling wire. Most of the
ladders were fairly sturdy but a few of them were nerve shaking.
We counted a total of 25 ladders plus some free climbing.
We then estimated the total depth at 600+ feet, with a total
of 3 pits. Two of about 200' and one about 100' deep. When
