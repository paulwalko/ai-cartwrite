RETURN TO THE POLER REGIONS-
PAUL PENLEY CAVE
by Ed Devine
It was July, 1983, and we were back to Diddly Dome in Paul Penley.
Cave, Bland Co., Va. to finally scoop booty. Six months before, after
nearly two years of frequently exciting effort which culminated in a scaling
pole climb at the top of a bolt climb 80' above the floor of the dome,
Chris Welsh had finally rigged a rope up the dome so that return would
be easy. We decided to name the region at the top of this dome The Poler
Regions if it went anywhere.
The crew on this trip were Diddly Dome veterans including Joe Zokaites,
Chris Welsh, Ed Devine, Miles Drake and the ever resourceful Cliff Briggs.
After about 5 hours of hard travel from the entrance, the crew reached the
Ante Room where the technical work for the dome climb was organized and
where the Sherpa support crews had spent so long waiting during previous
trips. From here a tight crawl leads 15' to the belay alcove where a
tight, floorless chimney leads out into the dome about 75' above the floor.
From here a caver could look up into waterfall spray toward the top of
the dome where Chris's goldline rigging leads to its anchor at the start
of the leads 30' above.
Before climbing the dome, however, we had to get the scaling pole
off the wall where it was still rigged from the previous trip.
In a lightweight wetsuit, I re-climbed the bolt climb and started de-
rigging the gear. All went smoothly until the pole was ready to lower.
The pole weighs about 30 pounds with attached gear but is awkward to handle
for one person hanging on a wall. The pole had been on the wall for about
6 months and steel parts showed a little rust but generally looked good
considering the constant rain falling on them. I pulled the pole down
and had the top hanging off my belay seat with a length of cord. The
idea was to transfer the pole to a longer rope that lead from me down
into the belay alcove where the other cavers would reel it in as I lowered
it.
Everything appeared ready. I thought the top of the pole was clipped
into the lowering rope. I untied the pole from my seat and dropped it
about a quarter-inch to take up slack on the lowering rope.
With shock, I stared as the pole fell and vanished from sight
below. In brief panic, I was sure I had clipped onto the wrong end of
the lowering rope and I expected the full 30 pounds of the pole to yank
the line after falling 40 feet or so. Would my belay seat or the bolts
from which I was hanging take the impact!?
With a loud crash, a wave of relief passed through me as I realized
that the pole hadn't been tied at all and had speared into rocks on the
bottom 80' below. This was followed immediately by a feeling of frustration
as I considered the destroyed pole at the bottom and the special trip
that would be required later to retrieve it. At least we wouldn't have
to carry it out this trip! I yelled my OK status to the guys below who
couldn't see a thing but had heard a lot of noise.
I climbed down the bolts, derigging as I went, and prepared to climb
the goldline Chris had rigged earlier.
It had taken Chris 4 hours to rig an anchor at the top of the dome
once he got up there. Natural anchors were non-existent at the top where
an unstable sandstone rubble slope continues upward. A tight stream canyon
enters the top of the dome through a voice-only connection to the top
