of the rubble pile and with great difficulty, Chris rigged around and
through this connection with about 75 feet of rope and sling to establish
a very stretchy anchor with lots of unseen, uninspected rub points.
With these thoughts in mind, I gingerly climbed the goldline and
was soon standing safely at the top of the dome preparing a new anchor.
The rock is terribly shaley and crumbly at the top with the only good
bolting spot being the bedrock floor in the stream at the lip of the pit
where rockfall and water are ghastly. This wasn't seriously considered.
We had brought a 3' length of steel angle from a scrapped power line
tower to wedge into the canyon at the top of the dome. I pulled this
up from below and rigged it like a big chock and soon had a belay and
cable ladder rigged to it. We had also brought along an 18-inch aluminum
angle beam chock which was rigged as a backup to the steel one which was.
also tied to the goldline. We anticipated many trips and this is a bombproof
anchoring system which should last for many years.
Reducing the splash and spray from the waterfall was the next job
to tackle. Chris and Miles had constructed a 10' x 3' plastic spray curtain
with grommets at the top and corners for rigging. I pulled this up and
draped it across the stream at the top so that most of it hung below between
the water and the cable ladder. Most of the water that had fallen on
the bolt climb like a continuous light rain was now deflected harmlessly
to the opposite wall. The bottom of the ladder, where it lead back into
the belay alcove in a "J" shape, was still in the splash but with speed,
a caver could reach the top largely dry. An electric backup headlamp
was still needed, however. The spray curtain was lashed to finger-sized
pebbles which I wedged into cracks and crevices around the lip; amazingly,
the thing has held and is still there after a year and numerous rock
falls,
With all tasks completed, Chris and Joe did the ladder climb with
belays from me at the top and Miles in the belay alcove, below. Miles,
who didn't like the look of the rigging, exposure, and water decided to
wait below while we explored and surveyed. Cliff Briggs, who was invest-
igating a potential sump-dive in a nearby lead, also decided to wait
it out.
In Paul Denley Cave, we always map as we explore. We try to stick
to a policy of exploring no more than 50 feet without surveying in order
to eliminate the occurrence of unsurveyed leads that nobody wants to come
back for.
When I had first climbed the dome, several trips before Chris got
it successfully rigged, I explored about 150 feet and quit at a junction
room with several good leads off it. I was sure at the time that these
leads were heading east toward Buddy Penley Cave and Newberry Cave which
lie less than a thousand away from the top of dome in that direction.
This looked like a real hot connection lead.
We surveyed up the scary rubble slope, observing how lethal several
of the boulders looked, and soon reached the crawl lead we had found
previously. As we started surveying this lead its westward trend, away
from the other caves and back toward the Paul Penley entrance, was evident.
We made rapid progress in this low passage and soon reached the junction
room where I had stopped previously.
We continued down the largest lead which was a 2' wide and 8' high
walking passage that went around a bend and opened into a pleasant
junction room with a phreatic "balloon" for a ceiling. In this dry spot
we changed out of our wet clothes into dry ones we had brought and continued
westward in an extension of the same tube that had started out as our crawl
