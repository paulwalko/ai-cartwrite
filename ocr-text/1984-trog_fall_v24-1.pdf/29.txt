COMPILING THE MAP
Introduction
The objective of my independant study project was to
photogrammetrically compile a 10' contour interval map of
Skydusky Hollow at a scale of l"=300" showing the eight
cave entrance position, and write a report describing the
process.
Much more in involved in compiling a map than the actual
plotter work itself; before beginning the compilation one
must some how obtain the imagery and required photo control.
These steps were described in the preceeding sections of the
report. The remaining sections are dedicated to explaining
the stereoplotter and entrance location work.
The Stereoplotter
The stereoplotter used to compile the map is a 1950'S
vintage Zeiss C-8 Stereoplanigraph on indefinite loan from
the Defense Mapping Agency. A first order instrument, it
was one of the best of its day and is still one of the most
accurate plotters in existence. It creates a precise stereo-
model on which measurements can be made in three-dimensional
space. This is done optically by shining light through a
pair of stereophotographs printed on glass plates (Diapositives)
which are mounted in stages. The right image is transmitted
to the right eye and the left image is transmitted to the
left eye, through a complex optical train of distortion
correcting Mirrors and lenses. This results in the optical
illusion that the image-to-eye distance and eye separation
(eye base) are much greater than they actually are. Thus,
the brain senses the parallactic angle formed between conju-
gate images on the two photographs, it is tricked into
artificial depth perception, and creates a stereo (three-
dimensional) model of the terrain.
Precise measurements of the stereomodel are made with the
help of a "floating' mark"; a dot of light which appears to
float in the field of view. The dot of light appears to lie
exactly on the surface of the ground when the image is in .
