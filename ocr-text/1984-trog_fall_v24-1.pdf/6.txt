A number of members (and some trainee scum, too) showed up
at VAR, which was held at Friars Hole Cave Preserve. There was
a keg party held Saturday night in Snedegar's complete with
music and candles for a quarter mile into the cave. Bridge Day
was again held at the New River Gorge Bridge with AR, Maureen,
Jim Washington and Alec Villagomez going up (and down) for the
festivities. This.was followed by Lawrenced Oktober Fest which
was a huge success including a showing of Das Boat and the
killing of 3 kegs.
Halloween was held at Turner beach with some of the best
costuming ever seen at a VPI party. Prizes were given to
Keith for his hiking boot with Mike. Futrell comming a close
second with his Jumar, Boo, for his wonderful make-up on
himself as well as AR, John Klein as the Samurai Caver, Garrie
Rouse for a wonderful look at the future. And the best couple
was Father Hugh and Sister Dave. And of course Becky with the
best-Hair-do. We also had a well dressed panel of judges this
year.
Now for a progress report on some of our surveying projects.
Lawrence says Starnes will be finished with "Just one more trip".
Mike Futrell is progressing. nicely in Wilburn Valley and the
Zo's are still plugging along in Newberry's. Garrie Rouse
has over 2 miles in Ellison's in Tazwell Co. Craig Fergusson is
mapping in Aunt Nellie's and Jack Kehoe drives 572 hours nearly
every weekend just to go Surveying with the Fouse and company.
And a number of people have been going up to West Virginia
regularly on mapping trips. Lots of trainee trips have gone
out and the new members are finding out that we are really as
weird as people say we are.
Now we're all looking forward to Winter Guarter and lots
of good caving and Ridge walking in the snow. Keep up the caving
and let's be careful out there.
