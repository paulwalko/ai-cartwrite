A MEXICAN ADVENTURE :

<
Shortly after the old Timer's Reunion on 183, I left
the next door caving of Virginia for the wilds of Texas and
Mexico, After some minor caving in Oklahoma and Mexico
( There are no real caves in Texas except for the Devil's
Sinkhole (which is closed), Bracken Bat cave (which has
5 million bats in it), and a number of commercial caves)
I was ready for my first real Mexican caving trip; six
days of ridge walking, caving, pit bouncing and general
spectacular sightseeing and partying.
The Tuesday before Thanksgiving, Mike Walsh, Bill Rupley,
Al Ogden, Russell Dobson (all from South West Texas Grotto)
and I left San Marcos and headed for Mexico. After driving
all night, we reached Cuidad Mante and after breakfast we
drove to a beautiful swimming hole where a spring comes out
of a large cave entrance. The crystal clear water was a
welcome sight and with snorkles and masks in hand we rushed
for the water. After our little R & R, we drove south to
Micos. Micos is a wonderful place, multi-level waterfalls
abound of which the largest is about 70' high. After a short
swim and a lot of food and beer, we turned in for the night,
Around 10pm Blake Harrison and the Hog-of-Steel pulled in
with a crew of 8, Thursday morning, after an hour or so of
blowing up ant hills with carbide, 4 of us hiked to the
uppermost falls (1500' vertical from the bottom). Behind the
largest of these falls we found a shelter cave 30' wide,
61 high and 8' deep. It was great watching all of that water
crashing down in front of you. At noon, we headed south for
San Francisco (not the one in CA). When we got to town, we
walked to Sotano de San Francisco and threw rocks down the
385'free drop and then drove off to find a place to camp 13
miles to the south. Going up a rather steep section of road
the clutch in Mikes truck overheated but we finally arrived.
and made camp la miles from Cueva del Puente. We had a ?
simple but filling dinner in honor of Thanksgiving, while
Blake and the Hog crew were some hours behind us enjoying
roast turkey.
Friday morning, we awoke to the sounds of large machinery
(in the middle of no where, Mexico??). After a little food,
we wandered around looking at and for holes in the ground.
Albert came back with tales of a water pumping station and
they were pumping water out of an unrecorded pit for use in
a nearby mine. After talking with one of the workers for a
while, Bill and Russel decided to descend the pit (which the
Mexican claimed was 1000' deep) using the ladders put in by
the local workers. Albert, Mike and I continued ridge walking.
We had a great time hiking around in virgin Karst and found
a few interesting holes but nothing really significant. After
an hour or so, we headed back to the pit to see what Russell
and Bill had found..
On our return, they told us about climbing down 200+!
and then, being soaking wet and tired, had decided to return
