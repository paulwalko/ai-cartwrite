ELLISON CAVE, W. VA.
The resurvey of Ellison Cave in Monroe county began last
winter after being "turned on" to it by Chuck Hempel. Chuck and
company had done the original exploration and mapping of the
cave some ten years previously. Since February of this year
there have been fourteen mapping trips into the cave, five of
which have included two crews. To date 11,567.6 feet have been
surveyed, putting Ellison's on the long cave list of West Vir-
ginia (at the bottom to be sure).
Ellison's can be characterized as consisting of sumps and
dry bypasses. There are a total of nine complete sumps most of
which can be circumvented. The cave has two major sections
(downstream Ellison's and upstream Ellison's) which are sepa-
rated by an intermittent sump. Mapping of the cave began with
the downstream section and was completed with about 3000 feet
surveyed. The intermittent sump opened in August (a long time
to be stuck on the wrong side), and the survey of upstream
Ellison's was begun. This part of the cave is now nearly com-
pleted. Over two dozen VPI Cave Club members have
participated, of which Frank Gibson, Bill Shipman, Mike Fut-
rell, Jack Kehoe, Dave Jett and Hank Heidt have been especially
helpful.
