and aroma of Mother Nature's ways were not lost on me;
however, there above me was what I most craved, DAYLIGHT!!
Surviving this ordeal, I later went on to marry the
person responsible for it, specifically one "Chew Weassel".
Having assumed the trappings of domicile life, I can now look
back at my experience and reflect upon the lessons learned:
1) Never trust a caver who calls you "Honey-Bunny".
2) Always go out the way you came in. 3) Don't Go In!!
