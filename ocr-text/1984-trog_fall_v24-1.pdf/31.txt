scale factor, Leveling the model involves checking vertical
control point elevations in the model and on the ground and
tilting the model until these vary according to the scale
factor,
Professor Johnson did the mechanical parts of the C-8
orientation because time was so short and it was such a
complex process. The fact that Skyd√∫sky, and thus the photo
control network, was in the corner of both models made it
even more challenging than usual; it was like we were trying
to use a level in one corner to level a whole table. I
learned many things during the hours of watching and helping
with the orientation process though, like why most state-of-
the-art plotters are equipped with microprocessors to handle
much of the iterative orientation processes,
Interfacing the Digitizer
Being a German-born instrument, the C-8 is a metric
machine so all of its gauges read in millimeters. Also,
the stereomodel is not necessarily at the same scale or in
the same position with respect to North as the map being
compiled on the table. The model and map coordinate systems
must some how be made to correspond to each other. The can
be done by one of two ways: Pieces of information can be
individually converted from one system to another, which is
a pain, or one can use a neat little electronic device called
a digitizer. I chose the digitizer,
The device hooks up to electrical encoders on the C-8
and registers movement in the X, Y&Z directions on a display
panel. Scale, rotation and three-dimensional positional data
are computed and fed into it via a key pad. After this
orientation procedure is completed, the digitizer can perform
many amazing little measuring tricks, if it's in a good mood.
I used it to measure model distances and elevations during
map oompilation,
Compiling the Map
Before beginning the compilation of the map, I got a
1"=300" computer plotout of my photo control point file.
I laid this under a sheet of mylar on the plotter table so
that the plotted control points corresponded to the points
in the model and then taped both securly down. These points
of known elevation and position were transferred to the map
and used to index the digitizer.
The plotting head, which holds the pencil, and is
connected to the X and Y. handwheels of the C-8 by a series
of universal joints. The actual drawing of the map is done
by putting the pencil in the down position so that it comes
in contact with the mylar. In this position, the pencil
draws lines corresponding to movement of the handwheels.
It saves lots of time to have someone sitting at the plotter
table during compilation to make sure the pencil is leaving
a mark, tell the operator when two contour lines have crossed
(a bad thing?, record spot elevations, darken in contour
lines, or do things that you would have to get up from
