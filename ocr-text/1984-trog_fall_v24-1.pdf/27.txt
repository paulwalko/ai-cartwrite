Dr. Johnson, the Teaching Assistants,' and I (Party Chief),
did reconnisiance work and decided where to locate the basic
control network, the backbone of the horizontal control used
on the project. It consisted of three stations (A,B,C) set
on hill tops from which the road and all the photo control
stations in front of the caves were sighted. The Teaching
Assistants and I then picked out one photo-identifiable
point which was near to each cave entrance as possible but
still visible from two of the basic control points.
The desired result of this careful point location plan-
ning was the ability to carry elevation from vertical control
points along the road to points A, B &c. and then from those
three points to each of the photo control points near the
caves. Ideally, this would be done by occupying A, B & C
to measure angles and distances to the control points and
then computing the elevations trigonometrically. Horizontal
positions would also be computed trigonometrically, with
point B being arbitrarily assigned coordinates of 10,000,
10,000 since only the positions of the points relative to
each other were desired. At least two positions and
elevations would be computed for each point and then averaged.
This procedure was followed as closely as possible, with some
minor variations necessary because of the mountainous terrain.
The second day was spent occupying the three basic con-
trol points to turn the angles in the network and take sun
shots, and barometric leveling. The Ziess Th-2 and Kern DKM
II-AE, both l" theodolites, were used. At least four hori-
zontal and two vertical positions were taken at each station;
any position containing an angle over 5" from the mean value..
was rejected and re-turned.
The azimuth of a line between two of the basic control
points was used to orient the horizontal control network to
true North. We determined the azimuth from the altitude of
the Sun measured using theodolites fitted with Sun filters.
This method requires observed vertical angles to the Sun
corrected for refraction and parralax; the apprixima te lati-
tude of the observer which we scaled from a 7.5" USGS quad
map; the time of observation, which we recorded from a
wrist watch; and the position (declination) of the Sun, which
we obtained from an astronomical almanac.
The last day in the field was used to measure the dis-
tances in the network using Electronic Distance Measuring
Instruments (EDMI), and more barometric leveling. The EDMI
we used, the HP 3800 and the Kern DM500, measure distance
using precisely modulated laser light which is generated by
the instrument, bounced off of a reflector on the station
sighted back to the instrument, and compared to an internally
reflected reference beam. The phase shift of the returning
beam is measured and displayed as a distince on the
instrument's digital readout. A different wave frequency is
used for each magnitude of distance measured. The Teaching
Assistants supervised the EDMI operation, while Mike Gaydosh
and I ran the reflectors and tripods overland from entrance
station to entrance station since we were the most familiar
