the C-8 to do, Anyway, the operator also needs someone to
go drink beer with after spending 6 to 9 eye-frying hours
at the plotter.
To begin compilation, I indexed the digitizer using
several vertical control points, alternating between them
until I got reasonable agreement of elevation values. I
then started plotting.
Planimetric features, such as buildings, roads, and
vegetation are usually plotted first. They are traced by
the floating mark, which the operator always keeps in
contact with the ground as the elevation changes. After
plotting the planemetric features, contouring may begin.
Ideally, contours are plotted by setting the floating
mark at the desired elevation and moving the floating mark
along the ground using the handwheels while not touching the
footwheel, thus producing a line of constant elevation,
Initially, however, the novice operator must drop spot
elevations and play connect the dots. This takes about five
times as long as following the contours and soon creates a
panic situation as he or she comes to the realization that
half of the allotted compilation time has been burned up on
one tenth of the map. Thus one is worried into spending
many eye trashing hours at the plotter trying to learn to
follow those elusive contours; but the technique, like
riding a bicycle, once mastered is never forgotten,
LOCATING THE CAVE ENTRANCES
As mentioned earlier, the caves couldn't be located
photogrammetrically since the woods were in full leaf at the
time of the photography. It was therefore necessary to
traverse from each photo control point up to the correspond-
ing entrance, tying directly into the entrance stations of the
underground surveys when possible. I soon appreciated why
Dr. Johnson refused to do this part during the summer lab;
it turned out to be almost as time consuming as compiling
the map!
The first survey trip almost qualified as a fiasco, :
mainly because of a faulty instrument. I read the instrument,
a Wild T-60-D theodolite with a 30" vernier; Mike Gaydosh,
also a veteran of the summer lab, kept book; while John Lohner,
Richard Cobb and Pat Nijkenson, gave me stadia shots with a
few moon shots thrown in for effect. The problem was that
the vertical compensator, which uses gravity to define up
and down for the instrument, stuck 5 minutes away from ver-
tical about every third shot, causing a discrepancy between
the forsight and backsight. It's quite un-nerving to appa-
rently be screwing up every third shot when you could swear
that you're reaaing it correctly. I was getting quite a
complex when Mike remembered something one of the Teaching
Assistants had said and smacked the instrument with his
field book. The vertical circle popped back to what it was
supposed to read and all was OK, except that we had burned
up so much time re-turning screwed up vertical angles that
we didn't accomplish nearly as much as I had hoped we would
that weekend. We did, however, manage to pick mass quantities
