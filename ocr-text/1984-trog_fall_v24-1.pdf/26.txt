Photo control points accurate to at least 1/5 of a
contour interval, or 2' in this case. These were also
located more accurately.
Basic control 10 times more accurate than the photo
control, or good to at least ,2',

Establishment of Control
Control was established in three parts:
1. Basic Control consisting of monumented points set by
a combination of triangulation and trilateration and
double rodded leveling,
Photo identifiable control points set by coming off
the nearest basic control point using side shots,
spur traverses and trigonometric leveling.
Barometric leveling to obtain elevations to be used
as rough checks in the plotter orientation process.
Barometric levels (barometers or altimeters) use dif-
ference in barometric pressure to register difference
in elevation. The weakness of this method is the
assumption that the barometric pressure stays constant
for an elevation. Although the pressure sometimes
varied slightly, the elevations were accurate enough
(+ or - 1.5!) to be helpful in the initial part of
the orientation, an interative process, for the 10'
contour interval map.
Mountainous terrain, forrested land, and large mapping
area size presented the class with new and challenging prob-
lems. Communication was usually only possible through field
radios. Travel time was almost half an hour between some
stations. Photo identifiable points were scarce, especially
since the Highway Department photos were taken in 1971. Finally
the shots were relatively long (some were over a mile).
These physical factors and other problems such as only five
people in the class, the project area being almost an hour
away from Campus, and being allotted only three days to
perform the survey, made organization and planning essential.
Four of the people in the class spent the first day with
a Path automatic level and two Philadelphia rods running a
level "loop" down the two mile long gravel road (SR 608) that
runs parallel to Walker Mountain. They used a technique
called double-rodded leveling which provides redundant
elevations, thus eliminating the need for backtracking, and
takes much less time than conventional leveling procedures.
Professor Johnson called it fly leveling because, he said,
we'd have to fly down that road to get it done in one day.
He was pleasantly surprised at the end of the day (about 7
P.M.) when we told him it was done. The finished loop
included temporary benchmarks along the road to be used as
vertical control points, and two USGS control points located
at road intersections to be used to orient the vertical
control for the project to mean sea level.
