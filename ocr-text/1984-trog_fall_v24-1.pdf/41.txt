From the Sign-out Sheets ...
Since July, 1984, Garrie Rouse, Jack Kehoe, Frank Gibson,
Mike Futrell, Lawrence Britt, Craig Ferguson and associates
have surveyed approximately 4 miles of passage among 12 different
caves. Estimates from the sign out sheets indicate 20800+ feet
of mapped passage. As of this writting, only Dead Doe is
complete with 823' surveyed, Others nearing completion include
Starnes, 2+ miles; Dead Cow, 4500'; Hodges, 2 crawls left, and
Nellies with one unmapped lead, Hopefully, complete reports
will be in the next issue.
Alšo, since July, the club has logged more than 2800 man
hours underground, giving us nearly 600 man hours per month.
This again makes us one of the most active grotto's in the
United States. Here are some of the highlights,
