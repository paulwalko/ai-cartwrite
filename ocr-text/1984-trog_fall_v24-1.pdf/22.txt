INTRODUCTION
This quasi-technical article was written to give the
average caver an idea of what was involved in making the
topographic map of the Skydusky Hollow area in Bland County,
Virginia. Being hard-pressed to define the "average caver"
I aimed at some one with little or no knowledge of surveying
above ground or photogrammetry, but included just enough
technical information to make it interesting and fulfill by
degree requirements. I hope you enjoy reading it as much
as I've enjoyed working on it; it is, after all, my ticket
out of here.
ORIGIN AND PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT
Every project needs a reason to make it all worthwhile;
this one had several.
Skydusky Hollow contains the largest known cave system
in Virginia and is perhaps the most popular caving area for
the VPI Grotto of the National Speleological Society (NSS).
The system is comprised of eight caves: Spring Hollow,
Banes Spring, Bane's, Newberry's, Buddy Penley's, Paul
Penley's, Harman's Avalanche Pit and Coon. For the past
20 years, grotto members have been surveying, dye-tracing,
and studying the geology and biology of the caves.
