My First Cave Trip
When one considers that the closest thing to caying I
had done was snow tunnels in my native Connecticut, I should
never have asked, "What's Caving?" However, that was how I:
discovered my girlfriend was (gasp) a Caver! Up to that
point, she was just someone to talk to while watching
submarine races in the New River. Suddenly I had to join
her on this "Quest For Mire." Feigning enthusiasm, I
agreed to the pre-death burial rite,
Of course, where does one take a Yankee Tourist on :
his first caving rrip? Certainly nothing vertical (a lovely
euphemism for DOWN) and nothing too macho. Perhaps a Nerd
cave, Not quite, We went to Smoke Hole.
I was told to be prepared and prepared I was; a full
change of clothing, old boots and borrowed helmet and lamp
(thanks guys.). I would have brought my scuba gear and
Rubber Duckie if I had known what was meant when I heard the
words, "By the way, this is a wet cave". I was warned I would
get my knees wet and they were.
The way into Smoke Hole is not difficult but not insulting
either. There is a mild chimney and a nice "break-down" room .
(Do it break of ten?). There were several passages with water.
in them and my knees got wet, I now felt I had seen the
worst this cave was going to throw at me and went on convinced
that caving wasn't so bad.
In the back of Smoke Hole, is a vast room about 150' X
60'. The biggest hole I'd seen before was the IRT Uptown in
NYC and this one didn't have drunks in it (another .
misconception). We played in this room for a while and then
started back. That was when it happened. Some one said
"Let's take the Water Exit!"
Being lead down the path of doom, I wandered on, not
knowing what fate (and some clown) had in store for me. I
didn't see the Water Exit until it was too late, Half of the
group was already through. For those of you who are unaware,
the first part is an exhilarating step into a small 5' deep
pool with a 7! long 'Duck Under'. Duck-under is another quaint
phrase cavers uge. It means, "there's air,' but a duck couldn't
swim under it. Well, into the pool I went (such a good sport).
Feeling like a new member of the Polar Bear Club, I went under
the duck and came out on the other side only to discover that
I was now in a river that went as far as I could see. Of course,
you can't see beyond the next duck-under. This is when
unhappiness set in only to be replaced by depression further on.
They told me there was air all the way through this duck but
I was too numb to tell. I held my breath and swam through.
It is normal to take a deep breath of air when one emerges
from water, and being fairly normal, I did just that when I
came up. It was then that I realized I was swimming in a pool
with a large sheep at it's peak of ripeness. The splender
