Editor's Column
Well, after a long absence, I've made it back to VPI and
to prove that history does repeat itself, I am again helping
to edit the TROG.
Mike and I were determined to produce a good TROG and
we'd like to thank the people who helped by contributing
articles, As for the rest of you that are long over due to
write something (and we know who you are), you will be
hearing from us (Did you know that gravel and carbide look the
same?!).
We are going to try to maintain a high level of quality
in the future TROGS and are playing with some new ideas,
(Maybe a color cover on a future issue) so you can look forward
to Winter quarter's publication with anticipation. Keep up
the good caving.
