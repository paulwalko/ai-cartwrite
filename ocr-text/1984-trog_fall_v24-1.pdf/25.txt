SKYDUSKY HOLLOW PHOTO CONTROL PROJECT
Introduction
A network of points of known geographical position is
called a control network. There are basically two types:
the vertical network, in which point. elevations with respect
to a given datum are precisely known, and the horizontal
network, in which X and Y point positions with respect to a
given coordinate system (i,e. Virginia State Plane Coordinate
System or Latitude and Longitude) are precisely known. A
point whose position is precisely known in three dimensions
may be simultaneously included in both horizontal and ver-
tical control network. If the points in a network are'
photo-identifiable (recognizable in the aerial photographs)
and the spatial distances between points are computed, they
can be used first to orient and then make measurements on the .
stereoplotter. This network is known as photo control. .
The members and instructors of CE 4420-Applied Surveying
Problems, the seven credit summer surveying lab, established
the photo control as one of their projects. Their objective
was to survey enough horizontal and vertical control in three
days to enable the orientation of the two stereomodels of the
area and the subsequent compilation of a 10' contour
interval topographic map at a scale of 1"=3001.
Control Specifications
The following minimum horizontal and vertical control
requirements were specified in order to enable the fulfillment
of the mapping objective:
HORIZONTAL CONTROL:
1. A minimum of three horizontal photo control points
near the edges of the mapping area in each stereomodel.
Points clearly identifiable (i.e. a prominent rock,
power pole, fence or house corner) and also photo
identifiable if intended for photo control use.
Distances reduced to ground scale.
Solar azimuths to orient the survey to true North.
Photo control points located to a minimum accuracy of
1/50th" at map scale, or 6' on the ground for a l"=300"
map scale. However, since the map scale had not been
definitely specified at the time of the survey, the
points were located more accurately than the minimum
value.
6.
Basic control 10 times more accurate than the photo
control, or good to at least .6'.
VERTICAL CONTROL:
1. A minimum of four vertical control points near the
edges of the mapping area in each stereomodel. These
didn't have to be clearly point identifiable if the
surrounding terrain was relatively flat.
