Approximately 20 miles of passage has been mapped thus far,
but many miles of passage still need to be done.
Karst areas, like Skydusky, are known for their caves
and sinking streams. This means that much of the water does
not run above the ground but under it, putting farmers at a
disadvantage during serious drought conditions. Using cave
entrance coordinates on the topo map to orient the under-
ground surveys, one could produce a bi-level map showing the
underground streams in relation to the surface topography
which would be useful to the landowners in the event of an
extremely serious drought,
The bi-level map would also enable one to see, for the
first time, the precise relative positions of the caves in
the Skydusky Hollow system to one another,
At the time of the writing of this article, the topo-
graphic map had been completed and the three-dimensional
(X,Y,Z) entrance coordinates had been given to Ed Devine, the
keeper of the underground data. He is working on the
underground part of the bi-level map.
The need for an entrance location/topographic map has
been apparent for many years, the problem was figuring out
how to best make one. Skydusky is too large and mountainous
an area to realistically attempt a Brunton or Suunto and tape
mapping project, as a few cavers discovered the hard way. I
decided to use my connections as a Civil Engineering/
Surveying major to try to attack the problem with some
serious equipment.
I went to Dr. Johnson, head of the Geodetic engineering
division in CE, in February, 1984 with my ideas saying
Skydusky was a "classic, textbook, surveying project." He :
said that it had potential as a project for the summer classi ..
but that there would never be enough time to traverse to all
the cave entrances, which would basically have defeated the
whole purpose of the survey. He also expressed concern
about the possibility of inquisitive cavers nosing around
all of his valuable equipment once they realized its potential.
Smart man.
The solution he suggested was analytical photogrammetry,
which happens to be my area of special interest in surveying.
If I could find sutable metric aerial photographs of the area,
he would consider having the summer surveying lab (CE 4420-
Applied Surveying Problens) establish the control network
necessary to interface the photographs and a stereoplotter
so that I could compile the map photogrammetrically as an
independent study project. The proposed map began to look
more and more like a reality.
