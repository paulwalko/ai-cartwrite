is available from the state and federal governments if 'they
happen to have flown a project in your area of interest. If
not, you can contract an aerial photography firm to fly the
area for you to your specifications but at considerable cost.
I spent spring break looking at the Federal imagery at
the National Cartographic Information Center (NCIC) in
Reston, Virginia, and the Virginia Department of Highways
(VADOH) imagery in Richmond. The best I could find was two
sets of photos (stereopairs) taken by the VADOH on September
15, 1971 at a scale of 1:16,800 (1"=1400') at an average
flying height of 8409' above the terrain. These photos had
some major drawbacks: the trees and vegetation were in full
leaf, making impossible to contour up to and locate the cave
entrances photogrammetrically; the mapping area was in
a corner in both sets of photos, making them harder to in-
terface accurately with the stereoplotter; the area was re-
mote enough that there were no nearby control points (points
of precisely known geographical position), so that we would
have to survey in all of the control ourselves; and that I
would essentially be making a 13 year old map because of the
age of the photography. I decided to ask the club to finance
flying the area. This did not go over too well; they didn't
like the considerable cost part so I had to go with the
photos that already existed. They did agree to subsidize the
purchase of these. Professor Johnson and I estimated that I
could make a 10' contour interval map at a scale of l"=300"
from this imagery, which was adequate for my purposes.
. . The next step, after the imagery, map scale, and contour
interval were decided upon, was to do some reconnaissance,
and determine the most efficient way to go about establish-
ing the necessary photo control network. Joe Zokaites and I
talked to all of the landowners to get permission for the
class to survey on their land. They were all very agreeable.
I then arranged for Professors Johnson and Onsrud, who would
be teaching the summer class, to come out and look at the
area to get an idea of what they were going to have to deal
with. We finally ended up making the trip on the morning of
the VPI Cave Club Picnic.
After talking to Buddy Penley for a while, checking lines
of sight, distances, and photo-identifiable points, having my
car bottom out and die on the way up to the Buddy's entrance
and realizing that this project would probably eat up most if
not all of the summer lab's travel budget, they concluded
that it would be a real challenge. That, however, is the idea
of the summer lab anyway, so they approved the project and
left before the beer and most of the prople got there, fort-
unately for them, I guess.
