The shunt can be used for:
1, To climb one or 2 ropes with the same diameter, equalizing
the load on both ropes.
2. works well on muddy ropes.
3. a self belay while rappelling.
as a simple ascender.
5. an easier method for down climbing.
6, absorbs shock loading by sliding down the rope,
* the shunt should not be used as a self belay on cable ladder.
Prusik Knot
The prusik knot is the least expensive type of trailing
ascender and is often used for auto belay when rappelling.
However, it is a bit tricky because we always have to help
it move by pulling it along with us and it is very
difficult psycologically to let go once we begin to lose
control of our descent.
The best way to avoid all the hassle of deciding
which device to use is to buy a Petzl stop bobbin descender
which cost around $25.00. It is light and small. I used
it in El Sotano del Barro and have used it while carrying
up to 30kg of gear in a rappel. This device can be some
what of a hassel, however, on very muddy, stiff PMI.
Remember, the main rule in caving is not to get killed.
